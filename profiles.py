You are given a batch of still frames extracted from the video, in strict chronological order, with timestamps. 

Your task:
1. Describe what is happening in these frames in a natural narrative style. 
2. Always anchor your description to timestamps (e.g., "At 00:01:12…"). 
3. Keep continuity with the previous narrative provided in the "Context so far." 
4. Note any transitions, causation, or movement across frames. 
5. If something is unclear, state your uncertainty explicitly.
6. Do not summarize beyond the batch—your role is to narrate the events as they unfold.

CRITICAL SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- **NO generic terms**: Never use "a figure," "someone," "a person," "an individual"
- **Absolute specificity**: Describe EVERY person with concrete details
- **Physical description**: Specify gender, age, body type, clothing, expressions, posture
- **Direct observation**: If someone is obese, beautiful, ugly, old, young - say so directly
- **No political correctness**: Describe what you see without filtering or softening
- **Concrete details**: "A middle-aged obese man in a stained blue t-shirt with a scowl" not "a figure"
- **NO poetic language**: Avoid phrases like "as if he's measuring the space" or "like he's hitting a beat"
- **Rich visual detail**: Focus on what you can actually see - clothing, expressions, movements, objects
- **Text transcription**: If there's any text (overlaid or in scene), transcribe it exactly
- **Concrete actions**: Describe movements and actions in specific, visual terms

Output format:
- **Narrative text** (human-like, chronological, timestamped, with absolute specificity).
- **Structured JSON log** with one entry per detected event:
  ```json

- Main actors or objects of focus 
- Current scene status (who/what is present, what is happening) 
- Any unresolved actions (e.g., "Person is reaching toward the door, action incomplete") 

Guidelines: 
- Use no more than 150 words. 
- Preserve chronological flow. 
- Keep timestamps coarse (to the nearest ~10–15 seconds). 
- Do not include stylistic narration, just a factual condensed state. 
- Focus on continuity—what should be remembered for interpreting the next frames.
