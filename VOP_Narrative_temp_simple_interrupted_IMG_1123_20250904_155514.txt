COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence opens with precise needle control on the central vertical incision. The right hand holds the needle driver; the left uses forceps to control the exit site. The needle is eased out of the right wound edge under forceps guidance, then transferred and regrasped at its mid-body for a clean reload. The driver sets the needle perpendicular to the skin, aligning the curve for the next pass while the suture loop is kept inferior to the field to prevent drag.

Building on that setup, the first stitch at the inferior end is driven without forceps assistance. The right hand advances the needle by rotational motion along its curve, maintaining perpendicular entry and a shallow, symmetric bite. With the suture spanning the incision, the driver is repurposed as a tying instrument. The left hand holds the short tail, the right hand forms loops, reaches through to seize the tail, and draws it across the incision. Alternating directions of successive throws square the knot and seat it flush over the wound without crushing the edges.

Next, the field transitions to cleanup and reloading. Scissors briefly enter from the right to trim the tails while the left hand maintains gentle counter-tension on the knot. The needle is then retrieved and loaded by the right hand at the proximal-to-mid third, jaws perpendicular to the arc, preparing for the next pass. Instruments not in use are placed superior to the pad to keep the wound clear.

With the second stitch, the technique evolves to a two-instrument drive. The right-hand driver advances from the patient’s right; the left-hand Adson forceps pick up the far edge to evert and present the exit point. The needle passes dermis-to-dermis across the central incision at its inferior third, following its curvature with controlled wrist rotation. After the tip emerges, the driver regrips closer to the needle tip to complete extraction. The left hand manages the standing end to clear slack as the suture is drawn through.

The moment the needle is clear, the right hand parks it safely and converts to an instrument tie. With the left hand controlling the short tail, the right hand forms the first loop and pulls the tail through, then reverses direction for the next throw to build a flat, square knot. The knot is “walked down” to the surface with minimal lift to avoid air knots. Again, scissors trim the ends while the left hand steadies the knot, leaving two neatly spaced interrupted stitches approximating the central wound.

Mid-sequence, the operator briefly demonstrates a pass on the separate right-sided incision. The right hand presents the loaded needle perpendicular to the entry site while the left-hand forceps evert the dermal edge. The needle arcs across that lateral wound margin with gentle tissue handling. This is a controlled, isolated pass; no tying follows here, and the lateral incisions remain open later in the video.

The focus then returns to the central incision for additional stitches. A full interrupted pass is shown in detail: the right-hand driver takes an outside-in bite on the right edge, releases and regrips as the needle emerges into the wound, then completes an inside-out bite through the left edge, maintaining perpendicularity and mirrored depth. The suture is pulled through in a smooth, deliberate motion with slack managed to the right to prevent tangling and to keep prior knots undisturbed.

Knot tying resumes with consistent rhythm and spacing. The needle is kept parked superiorly on the long limb to reduce accidental puncture while the right hand uses the driver to execute instrument ties. The left hand maintains steady counter-tension on the short end. Throws are alternated to square the knot; vectors are kept horizontal across the incision to lay the knot flat and avoid tissue strangulation. Each knot is trimmed close while the left hand stabilizes the construct.

As the operator moves cranially along the central incision, the pattern repeats: precise loading, perpendicular needle entry, wrist-driven rotation through mirrored depths, controlled regrasping for extraction, meticulous suture management, then instrument ties with alternating directions to secure each stitch. Hands approach from opposite sides and remain separated to preserve visualization; where crossing is necessary, it is brief and purposeful during tail retrieval.

By the end, the central incision bears four evenly spaced, simple interrupted sutures with short, trimmed tails and well-approximated edges. The previously demonstrated lateral incisions on the left and right remain open and untouched after the single illustrative pass on the right-sided wound. The final frames quiet down: no active needle driving is seen, instruments rest superior to the field, and both hands briefly steady the wooden board before withdrawing. The operative field is unobstructed, showing tidy knots centered over the central wound and a clean, organized workspace—an overall cadence of pass, regrip, pull-through, park, tie, cut, and advance that becomes more efficient and consistent as the sequence progresses.
