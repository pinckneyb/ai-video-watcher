COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a clean setup on a suturing practice pad that has three parallel incisions. After a brief moment with instruments resting, the right hand enters and assumes control of a gold-handled needle holder while the left hand lifts a pair of toothed forceps. The needle is already loaded appropriately on the driver, grasped at the proximal-to-mid third and oriented concave side toward the operator. Working over the central incision, the left hand everts the near edge and presents the entry point. The right hand brings the needle in at close to 90 degrees and begins a controlled, rotational pass from the right edge toward the left, following the needle’s curve rather than pushing straight through. The suture is kept out of the way and draped low-right to avoid tangling.

With the initial passage completed, the focus shifts immediately to tying rather than taking another bite. The left hand keeps the wound edges stable with gentle forceps eversion while the right hand converts the needle holder into a tying instrument. A loop is formed, the driver reaches through to capture the free end, and the first throw is delivered. Tension is applied in opposing directions across the incision to draw the loop down. The left hand then transitions from forceps to pinching the short tail directly, establishing a consistent division of roles: left hand manages the short limb and counter-tension; right hand with the driver forms and delivers throws.

The tying sequence settles into a steady rhythm. The standing part is double-wrapped around the driver for the first throw (a surgeon’s knot), then hands separate laterally to seat it flat over the midline. Subsequent throws alternate directions with single wraps to square the knot. The right hand repeatedly crosses the field to grasp and pull the short end through; the left hand holds steady tension on the opposite strand and refines knot position as each throw seats. The knot is dressed deliberately so it lands directly on the incision without twisting or strangulating the tissue. Once secure, the right hand sets the driver aside momentarily and picks up scissors to trim the tails short while the left hand maintains the knot’s position.

With that stitch finished, the right hand reloads a new needle while the left hand controls the suture strand and clears the field. Without forceps at first, the right hand again approaches the inferior portion of the central incision. The bite begins on the right edge, outside-to-inside at a consistent distance from the margin. The needle is driven along its curve; the driver briefly releases and regrips closer to the tip to complete the arc and extract the needle smoothly. As the needle emerges, the left hand returns to forceps to provide gentle counter-traction and eversion on the far edge, then releases to gather and manage the suture. The right hand pulls the suture through, creating a surface loop that is swept clear of the wound.

Knot tying resumes with the same instrument-tie cadence used before: the driver lays a loop, reaches through to retrieve the short limb, and both hands pull in opposing vectors to seat the throw centrally. Alternating directions maintain a flat, square configuration. The driver stays close to the knot as each throw is added, functioning both as tie tool and knot pusher. The left hand modulates counter-tension and intermittently dresses the knot to keep it centered. After the final throw, the right hand switches briefly to scissors again to trim the tails, then reclaims the needle holder to prepare for another stitch.

Midway through the procedure, the operator briefly repositions to the medial edge of a neighboring incision to the right of center. The right hand presents the needle perpendicularly, grasped two-thirds from the tip; the left hand, now with forceps again, stabilizes and everts the medial edge. The needle tip is positioned just off the margin for an orthogonal entry. In that short interval only the setup and initiation of the bite are seen. The sequence then returns to a familiar close-and-tie pattern on the primary wound line.

As work progresses superiorly along the central incision, the technique remains consistent but more fluid. The right hand leads each pass: grasp, orient to near 90 degrees, rotate through the near edge, regrip closer to the tip for a controlled exit, and draw the needle out on the far side. The left hand times its forceps engagement to lift the target edge without crushing, then changes roles to manage the suture tails as tying begins. The instrument ties are crisp and economical: first a secure throw (often a double wrap), then alternating single wraps to square and lock the knot. Each throw is seated with equal, opposing traction so the knot lies flat across the incision rather than sliding to one side. When needed, the driver acts as a knot pusher to snug the throws down without over-tightening.

In later sequences near the superior end of the incision, the same choreography repeats. The right hand completes a pass with a mid-body grasp and a brief regrip near the tip; the left hand is ready with forceps to guide the needle’s emergence. With both suture limbs now present, tying begins immediately. The left hand sometimes keeps the forceps in a light hold near the knot site to steady the pad while still controlling the long limb, while the right hand forms the loop, captures the free end, and lays the first throw. The hands oppose one another across the field—left low/left, right high/right—defining clear tension vectors that square the knot. Additional alternating throws follow in the same measured cadence until the stitch is definitively secured. The right hand then exchanges the driver for scissors, trims the tails under continued left-hand stabilization, and returns the field to neutral.

The procedure concludes with instruments briefly parked at the top of the board and both hands off the tissue, reflecting a pause in activity and a tidy field. In the final moments, both gloved hands re-enter only to stabilize the board, confirming that all active suturing and tying has been completed. Overall, the sequence demonstrates a consistent, controlled flow: precise needle placement with perpendicular entry and rotational passage, gentle tissue handling with intermittent forceps eversion, efficient instrument ties with alternating throws, careful knot dressing directly over the incision, and timely trimming—each cycle repeating along the wound with a calm, practiced rhythm.
