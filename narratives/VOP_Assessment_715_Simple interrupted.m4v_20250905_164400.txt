Pattern: Simple Interrupted

1. Perpendicular needle passes 4/5 proficient
- Needle drives consistently approached at near 90 degrees with controlled wrist rotation following the curve, and crossings to the opposite edge were smooth without skiving. Overall bite orientation appeared symmetric across the incision, with clean entry and exit paths.

2. Gentle tissue handling 3/5 competent
- Forceps were used briefly and lightly to evert, and slack was often managed with fingers rather than repeatedly grasping the skin. Occasional passes without active forceps presentation risked pushing tissue instead of clean presentation, but no crushing was evident.

3. Square, secure knots 4/5 proficient
- Instrument ties were executed with alternating pulls that seated flat and flush, and tensioning avoided tissue lift. Final trims were close to the knot without loosening, consistent with square, secure constructs.

4. Appropriate approximation/tension 3/5 competent
- Edges were brought together smoothly with the throws seated just tight enough to approximate without blanching. No gapping or puckering was apparent after tying.

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm) 3/5 competent
- The completed stitches on the right-most incision formed a neat, regular line with intervals appearing consistent and clinically acceptable. No clustered or widely spaced outliers were evident.

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable) 3/5 competent
- Edges were gently everted during placement and remained flat to slightly everted after tying. No inversion of the dermal margins was evident in the completed row.

7. Economy of time and motion 2/5 developing
- The workflow included repeated reloading, instrument parking, and off-field movements with several organizational pauses that did not advance the stitch. These inefficiencies interrupted cadence and prolonged task time.

Summative assessment:
Your passes show deliberate control with a consistent perpendicular approach and smooth curvature following, and your knots are laid down flat with disciplined, alternating tension. The finished row on the right-most wound looks clean, with acceptable approximation and tidy, close trimming.

The limiting factor is flow. Repeated setup without committed passes, off-field instrument parking, and view occlusions break rhythm and waste time; you must keep both hands working in the field, present each edge reliably with forceps for every bite, and minimize regrasping by preloading the needle properly. Standardize your sequence—present edge, drive-perpendicular, retrieve, tie—then repeat with the same hand roles to build cadence and efficiency while maintaining the good needle angles and knot quality you’ve demonstrated.
