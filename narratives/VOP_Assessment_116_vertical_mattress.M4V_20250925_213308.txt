COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The case follows a single, continuous closure performed on a simulated skin pad. The operative focus is a short oblique/diagonal incision located in the lower‑left quadrant of the pad (a 2–3 cm full‑thickness linear defect with nearby previous bites). Throughout the recording the operator repeatedly returns to that same wound and advances sequential interrupted sutures along its length, moving from one end of the line toward the other and completing passes, retrievals, and knot work in logical succession. Although a few frames briefly show other regions of the pad or instrument repositioning, the procedure narrative below treats all activity as part of closing that lower‑left diagonal/oblique defect and notes instances where frames suggest alternate views or temporary instrument changes.

Initial approach and first passes
The session opens with careful instrument positioning: the surgeon’s right (dominant) hand consistently holds a needle driver while the left hand uses Adson‑style tissue forceps to present and stabilize the wound edges. Early passes show the curved, swaged needle grasped near the mid‑shaft or slightly toward the hub in the driver to maximize control of the arc. The left forceps tents the near edge and provides counter‑traction while the needle driver advances a perpendicular‑to‑oblique bite from the opposite side. The needle describes a controlled arc through the dermal simulator, and upon emergence the operator pulls the suture through to externalize the tail in preparation for tying.

Throughout these initial frames the operator favors slightly everted tissue apposition. The forceps lift and evert the epidermal margin such that the needle takes a full‑thickness bite at an appropriate depth for simple interrupted closure on the model. Motion is deliberate and conservative; edges approximate with minimal puckering and the simulator tissue remains intact without tearing. Instrument tips remain close to the wound (typically within 2–6 cm of one another), allowing fine control during needle passage and transfer.

Sequential placement and instrument choreography
As the procedure progresses, additional interrupted stitches are placed in sequence along the incision. The pattern is methodical: the operator delivers a bite with the driver, the needle exits and is grasped or received by the left forceps (or a second needle holder when needed), the suture is pulled through and tidied, and the knot is then formed and secured. The needle is most often held in the driver near its body (mid‑shaft), which supports controlled rotation and the characteristic three‑point arc needle motion used to traverse the synthetic dermis.

Hand positions remain highly consistent. The right hand is the primary needle‑controlling hand and oscillates between approaches from slightly lateral/cephalad, superior, or medial aspects of the wound depending on the bite location along the line. The left hand alternates between an Adson‑style pickup for precise edge control, a long hemostat for temporary suture parking, and straight scissors at times for tail trimming. Assistant or secondary instruments intermittently support suture tails with a Mayo or ring forceps while the surgeon completes knot tying.

Needle transfer and retrieval maneuvers are executed with instruments crossing above the wound when necessary. The team frequently uses the left forceps to receive or steady the needle tip as the driver withdraws it, then manipulates the looped suture to optimize tail length for knotting. Suture tails are managed between passes: the left hand commonly secures the tail to maintain tension or prevent entanglement while the right hand repositions for the next bite. A hemostat is occasionally clipped to a tail to hold tension while a subsequent pass is performed.

Progression along the incision, distal and proximal advancement
Work advances from one end of the incision toward the opposite end in an organized, linear manner. In earlier frames the operator closes bites nearer the lateral/distal portion of the diagonal line; subsequent frames show additional interrupted stitches placed progressively toward the more proximal or medial portion. At several points the operator pauses to secure recent knots, tighten loops, and trim tails before continuing. These knotting steps involve coordinated use of the driver and forceps: the driver delivers throws while the forceps places counter‑traction on the tail and helps form a compact square knot. In many frames the needle driver is used both to pull the suture through tissue and to perform instrument ties, reflecting practical conversion between needle driving and knot securing with the same instrument.

Technique details and consistency
The chosen technique throughout is a series of simple interrupted skin sutures using a curved needle and driver/forceps instrument pairing. Needle grips are consistent—driver grasp at or near the mid‑shaft, allowing controlled rotation through the tissue, and the left instrument applying tissue tenting or receiving the needle. The needle path is generally perpendicular-to-oblique with a shallow-to-moderate depth through the dermal simulator, designed to bring skin edges into direct apposition with slight eversion for optimal epidermal contact.

As the closure progresses there is stable technique fidelity: the operator consistently recreates the same bite geometry and suture handling technique for each stitch. Suture tails are kept short once tied, and knot security is emphasized by forming multiple throws with attention to snug approximation rather than excessive tension. Throughout the sequence the operator avoids overt tissue bunching; occasional minimal puckering is corrected either by adjusting suture tension or adding subsequent bites to distribute tension evenly along the line.

Instrument and posture variations
Although the same hand roles are maintained, hand positions show subtle evolution to accommodate line progression. For bites near the lateral/distal region the right driver often approaches from a more lateral or superior angle; for bites moving medially the driver comes from a more cephalad or medial approach. The left forceps shifts correspondingly, sometimes stabilizing medially and other times laterally, always positioned to receive the needle or to hold the near edge taut. Hands typically remain within a narrow “working envelope” of 2–6 cm over the incision to support precision; occasional larger separations (up to ~8–10 cm) appear when an assistant or long hemostat is used for tail control.

There are times when the left hand uses an alternative instrument—a long ringed needle holder, a curved hemostat, or scissors—to accommodate knotting or cutting. During these moments the right hand continues to manage needle orientation or perform knot throws. Occasional frames show the left hand parked with a hemostat clipped to a suture tail while the right hand performs another pass, an efficient method to maintain tension and control multiple suture limbs.

Knotting, dressing, and final consolidation
Intermediate frames emphasize knot tying and suture tail management. Several stitches are tightened and secured before the next bite is placed, demonstrating a balanced approach between placing a string of throws and securing each stitch individually. The operator forms secure square knots by alternating instrument ties and uses the left forceps to guide tail orientation. Scissors or curved Mayo instruments appear periodically to trim tails to appropriate length, and at least one frame shows the assistant lifting a recently tied suture with a hemostat while the surgeon checks tension and alignment.

The pattern of tying is pragmatic: stitch placement, needle exit and retrieval, tail control, knot formation, tension assessment, and tail trimming. This sequence repeats along the entire incision until the operator reaches the other end. When bites are complete, the row of interrupted sutures presents uniform edge approximation and subtle eversion, consistent with textbook skin closure.

Noted inconsistencies and frame anomalies
A few portions of the recording include frames that depict slightly different regions of the pad or alternative perspectives that could suggest another simultaneous suture line. For instance, some early and intermediate frames show a small circular puncture or a vertical midline incision elsewhere on the pad. These frames likely represent camera shifts, instrument repositioning, or brief examination of adjacent practice areas rather than a change in the procedure objective. Despite occasional variations in view, the procedural actions—including the repeated needle handling, tissue stabilization patterns, and the progressive row of interrupted stitches—are united by treatment of the same oblique/diagonal lower‑left incision. These transient discrepancies do not alter the overall technique, which remains a continuous series of simple interrupted sutures applied in sequence to this wound.

Final inspection and wound status
By the final frames the entire incision is uniformly approximated by a contiguous series of interrupted sutures. The skin edges are closely opposed with modest eversion at each bite, and knots are compact with trimmed tails. The sutures are evenly spaced along the line, and there is no evidence of excessive tension or tissue strangulation—puckering is minimal. Instrument withdrawal and final hand positions reflect completion: the right hand rests with the driver or scissors near the knot while the left hand may provide the last orientation or remove a holding hemostat.

Overall impression
The closure demonstrates a methodical, consistent technique of simple interrupted sutures on a synthetic skin model. The operator maintains disciplined instrument handling—steady driver grips near the needle shaft, reliable three‑point arc needle motion, and efficient needle transfer to the receiving instrument—while the left hand performs precise tissue presentation and suture management. Suturing advances sequentially along the incision with coordinated knot tying and tail trimming, resulting in a neat, adequately everted, and well‑approximated wound closure. Minor frame-to-frame variations in view and occasional alternative instrument use are present but do not detract from the continuity and technical soundness of the repair.
