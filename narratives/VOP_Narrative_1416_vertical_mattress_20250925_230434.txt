COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator positioned over the central vertical incision in the middle of the practice pad. From the opening frames the surgical plan is straightforward and methodical: the operator places sequential interrupted skin sutures to re-approximate a short full‑thickness linear defect. Early maneuvers establish the working rhythm and ergonomics that persist through the case. The dominant hand controls a needle‑holding instrument (needle driver) while the non‑dominant hand uses fine tissue forceps or fingertips to present and stabilize the opposite wound edge. Hands sit immediately above the wound and remain closely opposed—typically within 1–3 cm—so that needle passes, suture retrieval, and knot work occur in a compact, coordinated working envelope.

Needle handling throughout the sequence is consistent in its fundamentals: a curved, atraumatic needle is routinely grasped near the mid‑shaft or at the body of the needle rather than only at the very tip or swage. The driver grip gives rotational control for a controlled arcing pass through the epidermis and dermis of the simulated skin. The needle trajectory is most often transverse or slightly oblique to the wound margin, with bites taken shallowly through the dermis or superficial-to-mid dermal layers to achieve epidermal edge apposition with slight eversion. The non‑dominant instrument provides counter‑traction and lifts the far edge into the plane of the needle bite so that each pass captures symmetric bites of tissue. This pattern—needle driver advancing the needle through the near edge while forceps present the far edge—repeats as new interrupted stitches are added sequentially along the defect.

As suturing progresses the operator follows a clear superior‑to‑inferior (and sometimes inferior‑to‑superior) sequencing strategy: a stitch is placed, the suture is drawn through, the ends are tensioned and tied, and the tails are managed before the instrument pair advances to the next bite a short distance along the line. Knot‑tying and final tensioning are performed with the same paired‑hand coordination. At times the needle has already been pulled through and the operator switches to trimming and arranging suture tails with a scissors or small clamp in the adjacent hand, leaving neatly cut tails projecting laterally. Throughout these finishing steps the operator inspects edge apposition and adjusts tension to reduce puckering while preserving slight eversion—an intended outcome for epidermal edge inversion prevention.

Hand positions and instrument approaches vary with the phase of repair but remain predictable and efficient. In needle‑delivery frames the needle driver approaches from the top/right or upper‑left quadrants of the image, angling the jaws so the needle tip enters the near edge and rotates across to the far edge. The opposing hand approaches from the contralateral side, sometimes using toothed Adson-style forceps, sometimes simply fingertips, to present and evert tissue. During knot‑tying or suture management the non‑driving hand may repose nearby to guide the loop while the driver seats throws and trims tails. When the operator needs to transfer or regrip the needle, a second instrument sometimes receives the needle or steadies the tissue; needle transfers occur quickly and instrument shafts briefly cross over the wound axis before returning to their established roles.

Tactile and visual control over tissue is emphasized. The operator frequently lifts small bites of tissue to ensure bites are dermal rather than subcutaneous, and continually modulates tension during knot formation so that edges are approximated without strangulation. Minor puckering is accepted and corrected where necessary by adjusting knot tension or smoothing the suture line with forceps or fingertip pressure. Suture throws are placed so knots sit on the surface; they are tied down securely and inspected before tails are cut. The result is a consistent superficial closure with slight edge eversion at each bite.

Throughout the mid‑portion of the video the same sequence—needle orientation, opposing forceps presentation, needle passage, suture pull‑through, knot formation, trimming—repeats with only modest variation. The operator’s grip on the needle driver remains pragmatic: a mid‑shaft grasp to maximize rotational leverage rather than a tip-only hold. When working at the very superior pole of the incision the operator’s needle approach tends to be more perpendicular so the arc of the needle completes a short, controlled bite. In the central and inferior portions the driver often approaches at a shallow oblique angle to accommodate the curvature of the needle and the available working space.

Several brief intervals show the operator focused on finalization tasks at the cranial end of the repair: adjusting tension, seating the last throws, and trimming suture tails with small scissors. In these frames the needle is no longer an instrument of passage but a residual item lying near the superior end or already removed from the field; activity centers around knot security and cosmetic smoothing. The hands converge tightly over the superior knot when cutting tails, with the scissors entering from the lateral aspect and fingers stabilizing beneath to receive and feed suture ends.

A recurring theme during the entire case is economy of motion. Hands and instruments move as a pair: when the driver advances, the forceps present; when the knot is tied, one hand steadies the loop while the other manipulates the driver; when tails are trimmed, the opposite hand maintains tissue alignment and absorbs any residual tension. Typical inter‑hand distances remain small (roughly 1–4 cm), enabling rapid transfer of the needle, quick retrieval of the suture limb, and immediate seating of knots. Instrument approaches vary between upper‑left, upper‑right, and medial angles depending on the operator’s handedness and specific stitch location, but they always converge on the same short working zone above the incision.

Throughout the mid‑video frames the operator occasionally pauses to reconfigure grip or transfer the needle between instruments prior to a pass. During those moments the non‑dominant hand may temporarily release tissue to allow a clean transfer, then the instrument pair re‑engages to complete the bite. When working adjacent to previously placed stitches, the operator demonstrates spatial awareness by taking bites slightly offset so as not to entangle with knots or tails already set. This sequencing maintains an even spacing of stitches and avoids clustering.

There are intermittent frames showing other areas of the pad—the rightmost vertical incision or small stellate defects—displaying established stitch rows or, less often, active manipulation. These frames provide context about the trainee’s broader practice but do not interrupt the narrative flow of work on the central defect. In several images hands or instruments are absent over other wells of the pad; when the rightmost line is depicted it frequently already bears a completed series of interrupted sutures that serve as a reference of technique rather than the main locus of action. A few isolated frames suggest different suture patterns (for example, mattress‑style or even a brief running segment described in one sequence) on separate lesions; these instances are noted as occasional deviations or tasks on adjacent simulation sites rather than a persistent change to the technique being executed on the central linear wound.

As the case advances into its later phases the operator’s movements increasingly emphasize refinement. Knot throws are checked and re‑checked for consistent tension. Forceps are used to smooth small ridges of puckered silicone and to re‑present slightly misaligned edges before the next throw. Scissors enter the scene more frequently to trim tails to a neat length after each secure knot. Occasionally the operator uses fingertip pressure directly over the repair to assess the everted edge and the overall line continuity, ensuring that suture bites do not leave unacceptably gapped areas.

The hand choreography in the final third of the session reflects those finishing priorities: one hand steadies or pinches the skin margin to check alignment while the other manipulates suture tails and ties final throws. When stitches are set, the operator alternates trimming and smoothing until the entire length of the central incision is composed of uniformly approximated bites with knots seated at the skin surface and tails cut short. The operator’s dominant instrument tends to remain the needle driver during the tying sequence, with the opposite hand performing the fine manipulations and tissue support required for clean knot formation.

Visually and functionally the repaired line at the end of the session presents as a continuous column of surface‑knotted interrupted sutures. Each knot sits on the surface with the skin edges slightly everted—an intentional mattress‑mimicking eversion achieved through superficial dermal purchase and careful tensioning. Slight puckering at some bites is present but overall edge apposition is consistent and symmetrical. Suture tails are trimmed to tidy lengths; residual tails project laterally but do not obstruct the repair. There is no ongoing needle passage or deep layer manipulation in the concluding frames—the work has moved entirely to final tension checks and tail management.

Throughout the case the operator’s technique remains disciplined: controlled needle grips, short arced passes, consistent pairing of needle driver and forceps, and deliberate knot seating and trimming. Hand positions mature from broadly exploratory placements early on to compact, efficient crossings and transfers once the sequence is well established. Spatially, instruments remain within a narrow working corridor above the wound, crossing only as required for needle transfer or knotting. Even when the operator briefly shifts instrument approach—entering from a slightly different quadrant to access the superior pole—the underlying technique and stitch pattern remain coherent.

By the end of the procedure the central incision is neatly closed with matched epidermal margins, mild eversion across the line, and surface knots providing secure approximation. The operator concludes with final inspection, minor tension adjustments, and clean trimming of tails. The result is a consistently approximated closure that balances secure tissue apposition with cosmetic edge eversion, finished with tidy knot placement and minimal residual puckering. Any intermittent deviations or observations on adjacent simulated wounds do not detract from the clear, methodical completion of the primary linear closure in the center of the pad.
