COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
Overview and operative intent
The entire procedure focuses on closing the single left-most skin defect on the practice pad — a short vertical/oblique incision in the upper‑left quadrant of the model. From the first frames through the end, the operator repeatedly works that same incision, placing successive skin sutures to approximate and evert the dermal and epidermal margins. The intended technique throughout is a series of simple interrupted skin bites (the app’s assigned technique is followed). Over the recording the operator alternates between needle passage, suture advancement/pulling, knot‑tying and tail management as each stitch is completed in sequence along the same wound, proceeding along the incision length from initial/baseline bites toward the remaining open segment(s).

Initial approach and first passes (0–60 s)
The case begins with identification of the left-most vertical incision (0–14 s). Both hands are quickly brought into a tight working zone directly over the wound (approximately 1–4 cm separation between instrument tips). The left hand assumes the needle‑driver function, holding a curved, swaged needle with a mid‑shaft to proximal grip, and the right hand uses fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style) to evert and stabilize the lateral wound edge. The needle is oriented to pass from lateral to medial through the dermis/subcutaneous layer. The operator advances the needle in a controlled arc, rotating the driver to bring the curved needle tip through the tissue and externalizing the suture. This initial sequence establishes the pattern: small, closely spaced bites taken near the epidermal edge to achieve precise edge apposition.

At 15–29 s the surgeon repeats the same coordinated two‑hand technique for another bite: needle driver above/medial and forceps below/lateral, with the forceps gently everting the edge and holding tension while the needle is driven through the opposite side. Grip of the needle is typically at the mid‑shaft to distal third; occasional shifts closer to the swage are used when finer control is needed. The operator draws the suture through, leaving a loop or tail visible as preparation for tying.

Completion and early knot work (30–104 s)
Between 30 and 44 s the operator completes a stitch pass and begins to pull the suture through; a loop forms as the needle is retrieved and the suture is prepared for a knot. Hands remain close together, with the needle driver generally vertical above the wound and the forceps positioned laterally/caudally to provide countertraction and eversion. By 45–59 s the wound shows multiple short bites already in place and the operator is observed both adding new bites and, in some sequences, managing a continuous segment of suture material that has been advanced across the defect. Despite occasional sighting of a running/continuous strand in the field, the operative pattern remains sequential placement and securing of individual interrupted sutures at each site of needle passage.

From 60–104 s the pattern alternates between new needle passes and knot‑securing maneuvers. At 75–89 s, for example, an X‑type configuration is observed near the wound midpoint — this indicates that the operator sometimes uses cross or figure‑of‑eight style bites in the small stellate area where better edge inversion or tension distribution is desirable. However, most passes adhere to small simple interrupted bites placed very close to the epidermal margin with slight eversion to the dermal edges. During these early phases the operator frequently repositions the needle in the holder nearer the body of the needle to maintain controlled rotation, and the forceps remain engaged in lifting and aligning tissue before each pass.

Progression along the incision; repeated passes and adjacent placements (105–240 s)
From 105–119 s onward the operator concentrates on adding stitches proximally and distally along the same left incision. Between 105–179 s the needle driver and forceps alternate roles of needle passage and tissue stabilization. The needle is grasped variably — sometimes near the midshaft, at other times nearer the hub or swage depending on the arc required — but the motion is consistently a short, precise rotation of the curved needle through superficial dermis or full‑thickness skin at the simulated model. The forceps evert and tent the epidermal edge just prior to the needle bite, ensuring the sutures bring epidermis into apposition with slight eversion of the margin.

At 120–164 s and again at 165–179 s the operator decreases working distance and focuses attention to a superior/anterior region of the incision, where suture tails and a loop are manipulated for knot tying. The driver often assumes a tip‑down vertical orientation to present the needle for either a fresh bite or for managing previously placed suture loops. When knotting occurs, the forceps maintain tissue apposition while the needle driver feeds and tightens the throw; the hands cross minimally to seat the knot and trim tails.

Between 180–240 s the operator continues this serial approach, frequently adding one stitch next to the previously tied one. A number of frames (180–194 s, 195–209 s, 210–224 s, 225–239 s) show small bites placed adjacent to prior stitches with minimal surrounding tissue traction and careful eversion. Occasionally short tag sutures or short suture tails are visible in the field; these are used as temporary anchors or remain as remnants after knot trimming. The needle handling remains deliberate: the driver presents the curved needle tip to the tissue, and the forceps stabilizes the opposite margin so that a controlled arc can be completed in a single, smooth motion.

Working the superior pole, tying and trimming (240–315 s)
Frames in the 240–299 s window show focused work at the superior apex of the same left incision. The operator commonly orients the needle driver to approach from a superior‑lateral angle while the forceps come from a medial‑inferior approach; the tips are typically 1–3 cm apart. Bites continue to be small and closely spaced, taking dermal or dermal–epidermal tissue to minimize gap and reduce puckering. The suture progression is linear along the incision with stitches added sequentially toward the remaining open segment.

From 300–329 s several frames document suture advancement and increased frequency of knot tying or seating of newly placed stitches. The operator alternates between short needle passes, pulling the suture through, and performing throws to secure the loop. When tying, the needle driver may momentarily be used as a knot pusher/handheld instrument to tension and seat the knot while the forceps holds the tissue in slight eversion. Small scissors or hemostat occasionally enter the field to trim the tails after securement.

Mid‑procedure refinement and reinforcement (330–419 s)
Between 330 and 419 s the operator continues the pattern of sequential interrupted placements along the left incision. Frames at 330–344 s, 345–359 s, 360–374 s, 375–389 s and 390–419 s show multiple closely spaced interrupted bites along the wound with consistent tissue handling: the forceps elevates and everts the edge and the needle driver rotates the curved needle in a controlled arc to capture matching tissue on the opposite side. There is attention to uniform bite depth and spacing, and prior stitches cause focal tenting or slight puckering that is managed by taking adjacent small bites rather than wide undermining or deeper bites. The operator demonstrates consistent needle‑grip technique (mid‑shaft to distal shaft) and controlled rotation to pass the needle through shallow dermal layers.

Throughout this middle period the operator sometimes pauses to secure previously placed stitches (tightening throws and seating knots). These tying actions are brief, and the hands remain close to the wound — the needle driver usually from above/medial and forceps lateral/inferior — coordinating to preserve alignment. The operator avoids deep tissue engagement; all bites remain superficial/dermal to simulate standard skin closure. Where the defect is irregular or stellate, a slightly different bite geometry (for example figure‑of‑eight configuration) is used locally to distribute tension and align the epidermal edges.

Late passage and finishing work (420–509 s)
In the 420–494 s timeframe attention remains exclusively on that same left incision. The operator places final interrupted stitches near the superior end and along lateral extensions as needed. Needle handling remains stable: the needle is gripped near the body for leverage, and the driver performs short rotational arcs to pass the needle through the dermis and out the opposing edge. The tissue forceps repeatedly evert the margins and provide countertraction during each pass. Several frames (435–449 s, 450–464 s, 465–479 s) show the surgeon seat and tie the most proximal stitches, then move slightly laterally to close residual gaps.

Between 495 and 509 s the operator places or secures the final interrupted bites near the superior-most gap. There is a final sequence of knot tying and trimming: forceps stabilize the tissue as the driver pulls the suture taut and ties a series of throws, and a small cutting instrument briefly enters to trim tails. The hands remain closely opposed and coordinated, minimizing unnecessary movement and preventing tissue distortion during the final seating of knots.

Final assessment and wound condition (510–514 s and concluding frames)
The last frames show the incision largely closed with multiple interrupted sutures along its length. Wound edges are approximated with slight eversion, which is maintained consistently through the knot seating phases. Tissue shows minor puckering adjacent to several sutures where multiple stitches clustered, but the overall alignment of the epidermal margin is good and the closure appears secure. The operator withdraws instruments after the final knot is secured and tails are trimmed.

Technique consistency and evolution
Across the entire recording the operator adheres to a consistent, two‑handed technique: a needle driver controls and rotates the curved needle while fine toothed forceps lift, evert and stabilize tissue. Grip position on the needle varies as required — commonly mid‑shaft to distal third, occasionally nearer the swage for fine control — but the motions are uniformly short, precise arcs suitable for superficial dermal bites. Bites are generally small and closely spaced to achieve accurate edge apposition and minimize eversion mismatches. Knot tying is performed in situ with the same instruments, using the needle driver to tension and seat throws and the forceps to maintain edge alignment. Where necessary to manage complex geometry (stellate segments or areas of higher tension) the operator uses figure‑of‑eight or X‑type configurations to distribute stress and improve coaptation.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Hand positions remain remarkably consistent: the instrument in the dominant hand (commonly a needle driver) works from an above/medial or superior approach and is positioned vertical or slightly oblique with respect to the skin plane, while the non‑dominant hand (forceps) approaches from a lateral/inferior aspect to evert and hold tissue. The tips stay within a narrow working zone — typically 1–4 cm apart — and cross minimally during passes. This compact, opposing configuration is maintained through needle passing, suture pulling, knot tying and trimming. As the repair progresses along the length of the incision, the entire working zone gradually translates along the wound (from midline toward superior pole or vice versa depending on the pass), but the relative geometry between the two hands and instruments remains stable.

Points of note and minor inconsistencies
Throughout the recording the primary pattern is simple interrupted closure. A few frames show short strands or the appearance of a continuous loop being advanced across the site, and at one point an apparent running segment is observed in addition to the interrupted series. These appearances do not change the operative approach — the operator consistently secures and ties individual stitches and proceeds along the same incision. Short tag sutures and variable needle grip points occur intermittently (mid‑shaft vs. near the swage), reflecting tool adjustments rather than a change of technique.

Final state
At conclusion the left‑most incision is closed with a neat series of closely spaced interrupted sutures. The epidermal margins are approximated with slight eversion, and knots have been seated and tails trimmed. The wound demonstrates good coaptation with only minor focal puckering where multiple adjacent stitches compromise the smooth contour. Instruments are withdrawn and the field shows a completed interrupted closure along the single left incision that was worked continuously from start to finish.
