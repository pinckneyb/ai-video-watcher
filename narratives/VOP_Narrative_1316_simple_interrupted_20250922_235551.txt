COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel vertical slits. From the outset and throughout, the surgeon concentrates on closing the central midline incision with a series of discrete stitches placed and tied individually. The lateral slits remain training references in the field; they are not part of the main closure, except for a brief demonstrative interlude that does not alter the progress on the central wound. What follows is a continuous account of how the central incision is closed in a stepwise, consistent manner, highlighting how the operator positions hands and instruments, places symmetrical bites, ties secure knots, trims tails, and advances up the line until the wound is coapted with evenly spaced stitches.

The sequence begins with fundamental setup and a first pass through the midline incision (0.0–14.0 s). The central slit is a straight, vertical cut marked by small targeting dots to guide bite position. The left hand bears the needle driver; the right hand uses tissue forceps to manage the far edge. The curved needle is mounted two-thirds from the tip, held so the arc can be driven perpendicular to the surface. The right-hand forceps lift and evert the far (right) margin at the intended dot, while the driver advances the needle from the left edge in a smooth arc across to the right, exiting at the mirrored mark. This is classic, wrist-driven, perpendicular entry and exit with good depth control, creating a symmetric, full-thickness bite that will approximate the edges cleanly. The suture is drawn through and the stage is set for tying, though tying itself is not shown within these first frames.

Immediately following, attention shifts to the inferior pair of marked points on the same central incision (15.0–29.0 s). The configuration mirrors the first sequence: the left hand controls the driver and the right hand uses Adson forceps with teeth to prepare the tissue. The needle is grasped at its proximal third and again oriented nearly perpendicular to the pad. The pass proceeds from the left lower dot across to the right lower dot, with the forceps lightly everting and stabilizing each margin to present consistent tissue thickness to the needle. The driver then pulls the strand through, leaving a tail on the left for subsequent tying. The emphasis remains on symmetric bite spacing and depth on either side of the incision to produce even approximation when the knot is seated.

For a brief period, the camera captures activity over a lateral slit (30.0–44.0 s, rightmost incision). Here, the left hand works a needle driver while the right hand manages the free end of the thread. No forceps are used; the tissue is not lifted—manipulation is handled by needle passage and traction alone. It appears to be a technique demonstration on the side slit, not part of the closure of the central wound. That demonstrative interlude continues briefly (45.0–59.0 s), showing tightening and completion of throws at the lower end of the rightmost incision. The operative method is consistent with the tying sequences used on the main wound, but it is performed on the lateral slit as a separate example. The main closure on the central line is not advanced during this interlude.

The next segment returns to the true closure sequence on the central slit (60.0–74.0 s). The left hand alternates instruments, then holds the needle driver; the right hand manipulates tissue forceps to help load the needle accurately. The needle is grasped at the junction of the proximal two-thirds and distal one-third, aligned for a perpendicular approach to the central incision. This is a preparation phase: the team reloads the needle and positions forceps near the central line to control edges for the upcoming pass. No tissue penetration occurs yet, but the setup and alignment are precise, anticipating another symmetric bite.

Tying begins on a placed stitch at the lower central portion (75.0–89.0 s). The left hand now primarily uses the driver as a tying tool while the right hand alternates between controlling the suture and briefly stabilizing the edges with forceps. The needle has already been passed; it lies off to the left. The operator forms instrument throws—alternating directions to produce a square knot—seating each throw smoothly while the right hand maintains counter-tension. The edges are gently everted at the tie site, and the knot lands squarely atop the midline. No new bites are taken throughout this sequence, but one stitch is definitively secured at the lower central point.

The next segment (90.0–104.0 s) continues the tie-securing work over the central incision. The left hand holds the needle driver and captures the short tail; the right hand controls the long end. The knotting pattern remains consistent—instrument ties formed by crossing the strands predictably over the incision and snugging them down. Forceps are used briefly for edge stabilization as the suture is drawn through and tensioned, ensuring that the edges meet with slight eversion and without blanching or gapping. With the pass complete earlier, the remainder of these frames are dedicated to finishing throws and squaring the knot, preparing for trimming later.

At the apex of a small angular segment within the central field (105.0–119.0 s), the operator places and ties another stitch. The pad’s central wound appears briefly as a short, chevron-like notch—likely a local contour or alignment feature rather than a separate incision—and the left hand proceeds with the driver while the right hand alternates between tissue forceps and suture control. The needle, grasped at the proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the surface, is driven from left to right across this central segment, retrieved, and reoriented for the opposing limb as needed to establish a balanced purchase on both sides of the notch. The edges are tensioned to coapt the chevron apex, and a series of hand ties completes the knot. Scissors enter to trim the tails, marking the completion of that stitch. The overall technique remains constant: full-thickness bites, symmetric spacing, and careful knot seating directly over the wound.

Once again the team prepares for another bite on the central slit (120.0–134.0 s). The right hand initially controls the free end of suture, then picks up the needle driver, loads the needle two-thirds from the tip, and aligns it for a perpendicular entry. The left hand brings in tissue forceps to evert the right margin and present the target site. The needle driver is poised just superior to the intended path while the forceps oppose it, perfectly arranged for a controlled pass. Penetration has not yet begun in these frames; instead, the operator is careful with setup, ensuring visibility, alignment, and gentle tissue handling in preparation for another standardized bite.

The subsequent sequence shows a complete pass and initiation of tying (135.0–149.0 s). The curved needle is grasped one-third from the swage and driven nearly perpendicular from the right side of the central incision toward the left, with the right-hand forceps alternating to evert and stabilize the entry and exit points. After traversing the wound, the suture is drawn through and the needle is lifted away by the right hand at the swage to clear the field. The left hand then repositions to begin tying, organizing the suture ends so the knot will lie centrally over the incision. The bites are symmetric, the tissue handling gentle, and the pass is precise—hallmarks that continue throughout the closure.

Progress continues just superior to the previously closed sites along the same midline (150.0–164.0 s). The left hand again operates the needle driver; the right hand alternates between forceps for edge control and the free suture end for pulling and tying. The needle is held at its proximal third, bevel oriented perpendicular to the pad, and positioned to enter the left wound edge and exit the right edge on the same transverse level. The pass is drawn through, leaving a measured tail on the left. Then the team transitions into knot tying. The throws are laid sequentially, the knot is seated without twisting, and the edges settle into coaptation with mild, uniform eversion. No forceps trauma is evident—only point grasps at the dots.

Another stitch is prepared in the upper midline (165.0–179.0 s). Early in this sequence, the left hand uses the driver while the right hand is momentarily free over the field; later, the right hand picks up forceps with a red handle to stabilize the left wound edge while the driver approaches from the upper left. The needle is mounted at the proximal third to middle, again perpendicular. The pass is planned from the left toward the right. This careful sequencing—forceps presenting tissue on one side and the driver advancing the needle in a smooth arc—repeats the consistent pattern established from the start: evenly spaced, balanced bites progressing in an orderly fashion along the slit.

The next two intervals depict tying and securing of the recently placed stitches in the upper-middle portion (180.0–194.0 s and 195.0–209.0 s). In the first of these, the left hand holds the needle driver over the knot site, then moves proximally and slightly left of the line as throws are formed. The right hand uses Adson/brown forceps to steady the near wound edge adjacent to the new stitch, ensuring the knot seats without edge inversion or malalignment. No new tissue penetration occurs; the focus is on tying. In the following frames, the driver intermittently grasps the suture for instrument ties while the needle itself rests to the right of the wound between throws. The nondominant hand stays lateral-right, pinching the suture tail to maintain consistent tension across the line. After several throws, the suture ends are separated to set the knot securely.

Completion steps for the mid-to-upper central stitch fill the next sequence (210.0–224.0 s). The left hand continues with the needle driver to manage and square the knot, then switches to scissors to cut the tails. The right hand alternates between managing the free suture end and briefly resting the forceps when not needed. The knot is tightened with alternating traction on each strand, seating it snugly over the incision and bringing the edges together uniformly. When the tying appears complete, scissors enter in the left hand and the tails are trimmed to standard length. A brief inspection follows, with forceps touching down lightly at the tie to confirm edge alignment.

Finishing touches extend across several adjacent stitches (225.0–239.0 s). The instrument in the left hand works serially from superior to inferior along the central incision to adjust knot security and trim tails, while the right hand stabilizes the pad just lateral to the line. This is a refinement pass: no new tissue passes are taken, but knots are checked, tightened where needed, and tails are cut to clean lengths. The result is a tidy series of evenly spaced stitches with knots centered over the wound. The two lateral slits remain unused during this finishing sweep, aside from the earlier brief demonstration unrelated to the closure.

At the very end (240.0 s), the field is momentarily still, without hands or active instruments. The curved needle and free suture lie off to the right, not in use. Along the central incision, several interrupted stitches have coapted the edges. At the knot sites, the edges display slight eversion, a desirable feature for skin closure. Small gaps remain between closed points, typical of an interrupted pattern and ready to be addressed by additional stitches if needed in a complete exercise. The lateral practice slits are visible but untouched at this time, underscoring that the work of closure has focused on the central wound.

Taken together, the entire sequence demonstrates a consistent, methodical approach to interrupted skin closure on the midline incision:

- The surgeon establishes a stable workflow from the beginning: needle grasped about two-thirds from the tip or at the proximal third, orientation perpendicular to the skin, and forceps used for delicate, point-only tissue handling at the marked dots. The bites mirror each other across the incision, producing balanced depth and width.

- Passes are alternated in direction as needed (left-to-right and right-to-left), maintaining even spacing along the line. Each pass is followed by careful organization of the suture ends so that knots are tied squarely over the slit and tension is distributed evenly.

- Knot tying is performed predominantly with instrument throws. The left hand commonly handles the driver for throwing and seating, while the right hand provides counter-tension with the long end and occasionally steadies the wound edge with forceps. As the closure progresses superiorly, tying sequences recur with the same alternating throws to create secure, flat knot stacks.

- Scissors are introduced only after knots are firmly seated; tails are trimmed close enough to be tidy without risking knot slippage. The final sweep verifies approximation and uniform eversion across the closed segment.

- Throughout, spatial relationships remain constant: instruments oppose one another across the wound, advancing in arcs perpendicular to the skin, and hands cross the midline during tying to lay square, alternating throws. The driver frequently resides on the operator’s left of the wound for passes from left to right, and on the right for passes from right to left, while the forceps lift the opposite margin to present the tissue.

- Tissue handling is gentle and controlled. The edges are everted at the time of both needle passage and knot seating, avoiding crushing or overly broad grasps. The pad’s target dots are used to maintain consistent spacing, and full-thickness bites through the simulated dermis are apparent.

- While the rightmost slit momentarily appears as a site of activity, that interlude functions as an isolated demonstration and does not alter the stepwise advancement of closure along the central line, which resumes immediately afterward and continues through to trimming and inspection.

By the conclusion, the central vertical incision is partially but solidly approximated with multiple simple interrupted stitches placed in a logical inferior-to-superior progression. The knots are centered over the line, the edges exhibit modest, desirable eversion, and tails are trimmed. Small inter-stitch gaps remain—appropriate for an interrupted pattern at an intermediate stage or near the end of a teaching exercise—and the needle lies to the right, ready if further stitches are desired. The consistent hand positioning, perpendicular needle trajectories, symmetrical bites, and methodical instrument ties together reflect a careful and coherent technique applied repeatedly to produce a neat, durable skin closure on the central wound.
