Overview — treated incision and overall approach
The entire video documents closure of a single, small skin defect on the practice pad: a short vertical linear incision located in the upper‑left quadrant of the pad (the same slit is addressed in every segment of the recording). Over the course of the recording the operator methodically places a sequence of individual interrupted sutures along that one incision, moving in a stepwise fashion adjacent to previously placed stitches. Throughout, a curved swaged needle on a monofilament suture is used, forceps are employed to evert and present the edges, and a standard needle driver controls needle rotation and purchase. Needle grips are consistently mid‑shaft/proximal rather than at the tip, bites are planned close to the wound margin (superficial to mid‑dermal on the simulator), and suture tails are managed and trimmed as each stitch is completed. A few brief intervals show only knots and suture tails with no instruments visible; otherwise the hands remain close to the wound and coordinated within a small working zone.

Chronological narrative

0:00–0:14 — initial work on the top row vertical slit
The procedure opens with the operator positioned over the top third of the pad. The left hand comes down from above holding a needle driver while the right hand stabilizes the opposite margin with fine tissue forceps. A curved needle is engaged in the driver and is rotated from the near edge to the far edge in a controlled arc. Several bites are already in place across the short vertical slit and the surgeon advances another pass. At this early stage the needle is driven through full‑thickness of the simulated dermis while the forceps lift and slightly evert the opposing edge; the suture is pulled through and tensioned. (Note: in the very first frames the stitch sequence momentarily reads like a continuous running pass across successive bites, but the ensuing maneuvers and the remainder of the case follow placement and individual securing of discrete stitches.)

15:00–44:00 — repeating short interrupted passes with opposing hand vectors
Across the next minute the operator repeatedly positions the instruments in close opposition to the wound. The right hand primarily controls the needle driver while the opposite hand presents tissue with Adson‑style forceps. Needles are consistently grasped at the mid‑shaft; entry angulation is typically perpendicular to slightly oblique to the skin surface to capture dermis and achieve slight edge eversion. Bites remain short and closely spaced, and each pass is completed by drawing the suture through so the limbs are ready for tying. Hand trajectories alternate between cranial/caudal and superior/inferior approaches depending on the particular bite, but the instruments remain within a few centimeters of one another and of the wound margin. Frequently the operator re‑positions the needle grip once the tip has been advanced to maintain control for exit.

45:00–104:00 — controlled short transverse/vertical bites, start of knot formation
The operator continues adding discrete stitches at the central portion of the slit. Needle entry points are close to the epidermal margin and the needle arcs shallowly across the defect to the far side. Forceps are used not only to present tissue but also to hold the emerging suture limb while the driver withdraws and then pulls the main strand through. Several sequences in this interval show the pass completed and the suture being tensioned and prepared for knot tying rather than a new pass — the operator alternates between advancing new bites and finalizing the just‑placed stitch. Hands work in tight coordination: one instrument holds tissue and the other controls the needle and suture limb. Slight puckering and eversion of the epidermal edges are evident around secured knots.

105:00–179:00 — consistent perpendicular-to‑transverse passes, stitch placement adjacent to prior stitches
The next portion documents the same methodical pattern: a curved needle grasped mid‑shaft in the needle driver, forceps lifting the near edge to present the dermis, the driver advancing the needle through the opposing margin and the suture drawn through. The operator places additional interrupted stitches adjacent to existing ones, moving slightly lateral/medial along the linear defect as needed. Throughout, bites are superficial to intermediate in depth (appropriate for epidermal approximation on the simulator), and the operator intentionally everts the skin edges to promote edge apposition after tying. Instrument approaches vary — sometimes the driver comes from above, at other times from the lateral aspect — but remain closely opposed so needle trajectory is controlled and predictable.

180:00–239:00 — continued passes with close bite placement and progressive knotting
The technique remains highly consistent: the coordinating hand holding forceps offers counter‑traction and edge eversion while the driver rotates the needle in a controlled arc and withdraws it through the tissue. Suture material is then pulled and kept under tension for the knot‑tying sequence. During these frames the operator is often working immediately adjacent to previously tied knots, placing a new stitch medially or superior to the cluster and preserving even spacing. The hands and instruments maintain a small, concentrated working window; tip separation typically measures only a few millimeters to a couple of centimeters, facilitating fine control of needle depth and entry point.

240:00–299:00 — completing and refining central stitches; attention to suture tails
As sutures accumulate along the incision, the operator spends brief intervals adjusting tension and trimming tails. The right hand is seen alternating between the needle driver and scissors/trim instruments to shorten excess suture after secure knots are placed. Most needle grasps continue to be proximal/mid‑shaft rather than at the very tip, allowing controlled rotation. Tissue handling remains atraumatic: forceps present thin epidermal/dermal tissue and the driver advances a curving bite to the opposite side. Sutures lie evenly along the slit, producing slight but uniform eversion; there is minimal visible tissue trauma.

300:00–344:00 — adding additional interrupted stitches superior/lateral to the existing row
The operator systematically places more interrupted stitches adjacent to the existing line of closure. The dominant hand controls the needle driver and positions the tip perpendicular or slightly oblique to the wound edge for secure purchase; the non‑dominant hand elevates and everts the near edge with fine forceps. Needles are often grasped a few millimeters from the swage to retain rotational control. New passes are drawn through and prepared for knot tying; suture material is externalized and manually arranged so knots can be placed cleanly. This block shows very consistent technique and minimal deviation from the established approach.

345:00–389:00 — predictable hand coordination and repeated stitch cycles
The workflow settles into a steady cycle: present tissue with forceps, grasp needle mid‑shaft, drive needle across the defect, withdraw and pull the suture through, tie and secure the knot, trim tail as needed, then move slightly along the incision and repeat. Hands remain close and coordinated throughout; instrument paths often cross superficially over the wound to facilitate angle changes for subsequent bites. Edge apposition is maintained with slight eversion at each knot, and stitch spacing is kept tight and uniform to create a continuous line of interrupted closures.

390:00–434:00 — upper portion closure and preparation for final stitch sequences
Work concentrates on the superior segment of the slit. The needle driver rotates and withdraws the needle with deliberate control; the opposite hand steadies tissue and occasionally manipulates suture loops to allow efficient knot formation. The operator also uses the assisting instrument to tent loops when trimming is anticipated. Depth and bite pattern remain consistent with prior passes — shallow to mid‑dermal bites that reliably oppose the epidermis while producing minimal puckering.

435:00–471:00 — finishing stitches, knot tying, trimming, and final assessment
In the final minutes attention shifts toward securing the most superior stitches and tidying the closure. The operator tightens knots, draws suture limbs under appropriate tension, and uses scissors to trim tails on completed interrupted throws. A brief interval (frames 465–471) contains no instruments on screen, showing only the tied sutures and tails — a static view confirming that active placement has concluded. The closure is inspected visually and via gentle manipulation with forceps; minor adjustments are made when necessary, then suture tails are trimmed and instruments withdrawn.

Technique evolution and consistency
From start to finish the operator applies a consistent interrupted stitch technique. Needle handling does not substantially change: the curved swaged needle is repeatedly grasped near its mid‑shaft/proximal shaft to allow smooth rotation and controlled purchase, rather than gripped at the tip. Bites are planned close to wound margins and are predominantly superficial to mid‑dermal — appropriate for epidermal approximation on the simulator. Edge eversion is a deliberate and consistent feature of each pass. Occasional frames at the very beginning briefly resemble a running technique, but the remainder of the case is dominated by placement, tensioning, and knotting of individual interrupted stitches; that early discrepancy is noted but does not alter the applied interrupted methodology.

Hand positions and spatial relationships
Hands and instruments remain in a tightly confined working field throughout. One hand consistently controls the needle driver while the other presents the tissue with fine toothed forceps. Approach vectors vary frame to frame — sometimes the driver comes from above/cranial, other times from lateral or superior directions — but the bilateral, opposing hand pattern is maintained. Instruments often cross superficially over the wound when altering needle angle or retrieving the tip, but tip separation is kept small (millimeters to a few centimeters) to preserve fine control. As the closure advances the operator steps along the incision, placing successive stitches adjacent to prior ones and repeating the same coordinated hand choreography.

Final state of the closure
The procedure concludes with the linear defect fully approximated by a sequential series of interrupted sutures. Each knot sits securely along the incision producing slight and even eversion of the epidermal edges with minimal gaping. Suture tails have been managed and trimmed in the superior segment; the entire closure appears consistent, evenly spaced, and clean. The final static frames show neatly tied knots with short tails projecting laterally, slight puckering limited to knot sites, and no gross disruption of surrounding simulated tissue. Overall, the repair demonstrates a repeatable, controlled interrupted suturing technique with conservative bites, attentive tissue handling, and uniform spatial relationships maintained through the entire sequence.
