COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a deliberate, stepwise closure of the central incision on the practice pad — the midline slit that occupies the middle position of the three simulated wounds. From the first frame sequence to the last, the operator repeatedly returns to and works along that central line, moving methodically along its length to approximate, secure, and tension the skin substitute with controlled instrument handling. Although occasional frame notes reference neighboring slits or brief work on adjacent puncture sites, the continuous surgical effort is directed at the central defect and all active needle passages, tissue manipulations, and suture advancement are focused on restoring apposition across that same midline incision.

Initial approach and first passes
The earliest moments show the operator adopting a classic two‑instrument, bimanual technique over the central wound. The dominant right hand consistently holds the needle driver while the nondominant left hand uses fine toothed forceps (Adson‑style or similar) to present tissue and control the suture tail. The curved, swaged needle is grasped in the driver near the mid‑shaft to distal third in the opening frames, oriented so the tip will enter the near wound edge and arc through toward the far edge. The left forceps tents and everts the epidermal edge slightly to present a controlled bite; the needle is rotated through a smooth, downward‑to‑upward arc and drawn through the substrate until the suture filament is externalized. This pattern — driver controlling needle rotation, forceps stabilizing the opposite lip, careful approximation as the needle exits — repeats as the operator establishes the first stitch loops that will serve as the basis for subsequent closures.

Progression of interrupted stitches and sequential placement
Following the initial bite, the operator advances progressively along the central slit, placing additional stitches in a sequential, interrupted fashion. Each pass shows the same coordinated choreography: the needle driver approaches from a slightly oblique angle, the curved needle is engaged mid‑shaft for maximal control, the non‑dominant forceps elevate and evert the near or lateral lip depending on orientation, and the driver completes a controlled arc through full thickness of the synthetic dermal layer. After needle exit the suture is pulled through and positioned for tightening and knot formation. In many sequences the operator positions the tail and readies the loop for tying or trimming; in other frames the loop is left accessible as the team proceeds to the next bite, indicating a methodical, stepwise interrupted closure progressing along the length of the wound.

Tissue handling and bite depth
Throughout the procedure the operator demonstrates consistent attention to bite depth and edge alignment. Bites generally capture dermal/subdermal simulated layers rather than just epidermis, with the forceps used to evert the wound margins to avoid inversion. Tissue traction is modest and controlled — the left instrument provides counter‑traction and elevation rather than brute tension — and the needle is frequently grasped near the body to allow rotation of the curved needle through an appropriate arc without skiving. In preparation frames the operator pauses needle activity to grasp and tent the margins, ensuring each subsequent pass will approximate the dermal planes and promote edge coaptation.

Instrument positioning and hand dynamics
Hand positions are remarkably consistent and responsive to the local demands of each bite. The right (dominant) hand sits over or slightly lateral to the central incision and repeatedly assumes the needle‑holding role. The left hand alternates between fingertip forceps, hemostat‑style clamps, and occasional scissors — performing both tissue presentation and suture management tasks. The hands frequently cross over the wound in a V‑shaped configuration, with tips operating within 1–4 cm of each other to maintain a narrow working corridor. Approaches vary subtly with incision orientation in the frame: sometimes the needle driver comes in from above and slightly to the right, other times from a superior‑left quadrant; the forceps correspondingly adjust to provide the optimal opposing vector for needle exit and suture pull. Where needed, the left hand also rests on the pad for stabilization, particularly when the right hand maneuvers the needle through a short vertical slit.

Periods of preparation, stabilization, and instrument exchange
Intermittently, sequences show the operator refraining from needle passage and instead focusing on meticulous preparation. In several short intervals the dominant hand holds only forceps, elevating edges to evert and align the tissue; the nondominant hand supports and stabilizes the pad. These preparatory actions occur especially prior to a new bite and are important for consistent edge approximation. Instrument exchanges are also visible — the left hand is occasionally seen to swap between forceps, a curved Mayo clamp, and a small cutter or scissors — enabling suture trimming or clamp placement as stitches are completed. These exchanges are done within the same compact workspace, with the operator maintaining a continuous visual and tactile connection to the central wound.

Adaptations in needle grasp and motion
While the general technique remains constant, the operator varies needle grasp between mid‑shaft and slightly more proximal holds depending on the required control for each pass. Mid‑shaft grips allow a pronounced curvature to be driven through the tissue; holding nearer the swage appears in frames where more assertive control is needed, particularly for shallow or short bites. The arc of motion is likewise adjusted — sometimes a shallow entry angle is used for superficial dermal captures, other times a more perpendicular bite is taken to ensure full‑thickness engagement of the synthetic dermis. These micro‑adjustments reflect the operator’s intent to maintain consistent tissue apposition and to place each stitch at an appropriate depth and orientation to resist dehiscence.

Sequential continuity and occasional pattern variation
Most frames depict independent interrupted stitches placed sequentially along the central incision. The suture tail is drawn through and the loop readied for tying before the next bite, with completed stitches visible adjacent to the working site and subsequent stitches added just medial or lateral to them. In a few segments, however, annotations describe a running (continuous) suture being advanced across the center incision. These instances are isolated and appear to reflect either a brief transition in technique recorded by the frame observer or an interim segment where the operator draws successive bites and tensions suture in a continuous fashion before returning to interrupted knotting. Regardless, the overall flow remains sequential and controlled: where continuous passes are recorded they are brief and integrated into the larger interrupted closure strategy rather than replacing it entirely. Any inconsistency is therefore treated as an intermittent variation in suture handling rather than a wholesale change in closing philosophy.

Suture management and knot preparation
As each needle is withdrawn and the suture filament appears, the operator manages the loop and tail with the left hand to prepare for knot tying or trimming. Although knots themselves are not always visually completed in every frame, the actions preceding knot formation are consistent: the suture is pulled to approximate edges, tensioned to achieve slight eversion of the dermal margins, and the free tail positioned so that a secure knot can be formed. Occasionally, small scissors or a cutter appear in the left hand, indicating suture trimming follows knotting at certain intervals. When the operator is preparing the next bite, previously placed loops remain positioned adjacent to the wound, reflecting a methodical, stepwise approach rather than placing and tying every stitch immediately.

Approach to challenging geometries and small defects
Small central puncture sites and short vertical slits in the midline are handled with the same principles scaled to size: needles are drawn upward through puncture tracks, forceps stabilize the tiny lips, and the needle grip shifts to enable careful control in very restricted space. For V‑shaped or undermined flaps encountered slightly left of center, the operator elevates and everts the smaller flaps with a ring‑handled instrument while the driver takes a full‑thickness bite of the opposing edge, orienting the needle perpendicular to the margin to capture adequate dermal tissue and promote good edge alignment. These maneuvers show adaptability but retain the same fundamentals of needle control, tissue presentation, and careful suture advancement.

Spatial relationships and coordinated motion over time
Across the entire timeline the spatial relationship between instruments remains tight and highly coordinated. The needle driver and forceps operate across a narrow working corridor centered on the central incision; instrument tips remain within a few centimeters of each other to allow precise transfer of the needle and to control bite depth. Hands occasionally cross, with the dominant hand approaching from above or from the operator’s right, the nondominant hand providing countertraction from below or the opposite side. When the operator needs to stabilize the pad more broadly, the left hand rests on the pad’s edge while the right hand works over the wound, demonstrating economy of motion and efficient bimanual coordination.

Final configuration and wound approximation
By the concluding sequences the central incision is uniformly approximated along its length with a series of well‑placed sutures. Edges are closely opposed with mild eversion indicative of dermal capture; suture loops are positioned and tensioned to maintain coaptation. Instrument handling in the last frames shows suture tails being drawn through, knots being prepared or trimmed, and the wound appearing smooth and consistently aligned from end to end. Any brief deviations earlier in the timeline — a short continuous pass or a puncture completion — do not compromise the overall outcome: the central slit is effectively closed along its length with controlled suturing technique, reliable tissue approximation, and attention to edge inversion prevention.

Observations on consistency and minor discrepancies
Overall, the technique is consistent: controlled curved‑needle passes with mid‑shaft grasp, bimanual tissue presentation and counter‑traction, and sequential placement of stitches aimed at dermal apposition. A few frame annotations suggest transient variations (notably a running suture interval and occasional work on adjacent small punctures), but these are isolated and integrated into the overarching strategy to close the central wound. The operator’s hand positions, needle handling, and tissue interaction evolve only as needed to respond to local wound geometry and bite requirements, remaining otherwise steady and purpose‑driven.

In summary, the central midline incision is treated with a disciplined, repeatable suturing approach: precise needle control by the dominant hand, tissue stabilization and tail control by the nondominant hand, sequential placement of sutures with attention to dermal capture and eversion, and final tensioning and preparation of suture tails for knotting and trimming — resulting in a well‑approximated, uniformly closed wound at the procedure’s completion.
