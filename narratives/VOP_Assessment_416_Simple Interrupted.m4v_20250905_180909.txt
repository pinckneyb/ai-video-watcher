Pattern: Simple Interrupted

RUBRIC ASSESSMENT:
1. Perpendicular needle passes: Needle consistently loaded on the body and driven nearly perpendicular with regrasping to follow the arc and symmetric, premarked targets. Minor phrasing of “nearly perpendicular” at midline keeps this just shy of perfect. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

2. Gentle tissue handling: Forceps are used to evert and present edges with light, deliberate grasps and no crushing; touch-downs during knot seating are controlled. Tissue respect is evident throughout. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

3. Square, secure knots: Instrument ties alternate direction, are seated vertically over the incision, and lay flat and centered; tails are trimmed after secure seating. Knots demonstrate reliable security without lateral displacement. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

4. Appropriate approximation/tension: Edges are brought together without excessive traction, with balanced, vertical seating of knots and no gapping or puckering described. Closure maintains consistent, appropriate tension. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm): Bites follow premarked, symmetric points producing generally uniform intervals. Exact spacing across the entire line is not explicitly confirmed, so this meets but does not exceed standard. Score: 3 3/5 competent

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable): Edges are consistently lifted and slightly everted with forceps during passes; no inversion is described. Wound edges remain properly oriented for healing. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

7. Economy of time and motion: The cadence is efficient and deliberate with instruments parked purposefully, slack managed laterally, and minimal unnecessary excursions; alternating hand dominance is smooth and avoids crossing. Brief pauses for trimming/reloading prevent top-tier efficiency. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT:
Your motion and flow are disciplined and repeatable: orient, evert, drive, regrasp, pull through, control slack, and tie with vertical, centered tension. Instrument exchanges are controlled, parking is intentional, and the field remains organized, reflecting confident suture and slack management and a consistent, economical cadence.

Hand coordination is strong with effective alternating dominance, clean regrasping to follow the needle’s curvature, and reliable two-instrument ties. To elevate further, standardize absolute 90-degree entry/exit and uniform bite width, lock in consistent interstitch spacing along the whole line, minimize nonessential hand switching, and avoid using the needle as a post when not required to preserve needle integrity and maximize efficiency.
