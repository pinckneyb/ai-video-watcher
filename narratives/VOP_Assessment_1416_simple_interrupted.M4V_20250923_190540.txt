COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The recording opens with a view of the suture pad on a wooden block. For several seconds, there is no manipulation: a rectangular paper label marked “1416” obscures the center of the pad, and no incision line is visible. No hands, instruments, or suture are present, and the workspace remains static. This brief interval functions as setup and orientation; it does not involve any manipulation of the simulated tissue.

Work then begins consistently on the same target: the rightmost of three parallel vertical incisions on the pad. From the first appearance of instruments onward, all activity remains focused on this single vertical slit near the right edge; the two more central/left incisions remain unused throughout. Initial access is deliberate and controlled. A needle driver in the left hand approaches from the upper-left while the right hand, using tissue forceps, stabilizes the right wound edge. The curved needle is loaded near its proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the skin to allow a smooth, orthogonal bite. The right-hand forceps gently evert the near edge to present tissue at a pre-marked dot, and the needle is driven into the epidermis/dermis in its natural arc. The driver regrips to maintain that 90-degree trajectory and completes the pass across to the far edge at a symmetric distance from the margin. Suture appears and is drawn through, leaving a trailing strand to be managed in subsequent steps.

After establishing that first pass at the superior portion of the slit, attention shifts to securing it. Without leaving the wound, the operator transitions to tying. The needle remains clamped in the driver while the right hand releases the forceps and takes the free limb. The driver tip hovers just medial to the wound as instrument throws are formed and seated directly over the entry/exit points. The right hand draws the suture laterally and slightly inferiorly, setting a clear angle to square each throw. Tension is applied with care; the tissue is approximated without crushing and without the assistance of forceps in these frames. With the knot seated, scissors arrive briefly to trim tails close to the knot, leaving a neat, short tail and a stable stitch in the lower-to-mid portion of the incision.

A rhythm develops: place a controlled bite, draw the strand through, tie with instrument throws, and trim. The operator intermittently parks the needle off to the side on the long strand, using the needle driver purely as a knot pusher or as a tool to grasp a suture limb during tying. Throughout this early phase, hand roles are consistent—left hand with the driver over or just left/superior to the wound, right hand with forceps for edge control during needle passage and then with the free strand during knot tying and tail management. The wound edges show gentle eversion where forceps are used to present the margins and during early throws when suture tension alone approximates the tissue. Completed knots begin to cluster near the midline of the right slit, with short tails indicating prior trimming.

Progression continues along the same incision, working in the lower-to-mid segment and then advancing upward. A new pass is initiated adjacent to a prior knot cluster, again with the left hand holding the driver and the right hand using forceps to lift and evert the selected edge. The needle approaches orthogonally, entry and exit points mirror each other across the incision, and the strand is pulled through. In several sequences, tying is performed without forceps; the wound edges have been adequately approximated by the prior bite and are maintained with suture tension alone while the operator executes instrument ties. The knot is seated squarely, followed by tail cutting, and the operator repositions slightly superior to repeat the cycle. The scalpel pad shows consistent spacing and depth of penetration as the series builds.

As the stitch line consolidates through the mid-portion, the operator’s technique remains steady. During some intervals only the driver is visible, hovering above the wound in readiness; at other times both hands operate in close triangulation over the incision. The driver alternates between grasping the needle to pass it and grasping a suture end to guide throws; the free limb is kept lateral to the right of the wound to maintain exposure. Occasionally the needle is parked off to the right on the long limb while the driver is used solely for tying, then re-grasped for the next pass. Each knot is tightened carefully with the tip of the driver guiding it down to the wound axis to avoid gapping or inversion. Trimming follows once a knot is secure, leaving small tails aligned along the slit.

Approaching the upper half of the incision, the operative pattern briefly pauses as scissors or the driver alone appear in the field without a new pass, suggesting a moment of preparation. Then, both hands return to active placement. The right hand again takes tissue forceps at the superior end, aligning with inked marks, while the left hand brings in the needle driver. The needle is clamped near its proximal third, kept perpendicular, and driven through the near edge with a smooth rotational movement. The forceps assist in eversion and in receiving the needle tip, guiding the exit through the far edge at a symmetric distance from the wound margin. The strand is pulled through in a controlled fashion.

This upper-segment work transitions fluidly into the same securement cycle: instrument throws are formed while the opposing hand tensions the free limb. Hands cross above the incision to square the throws, and the knot is snugged directly over the pass, consolidating the new stitch into the evolving closure. In several sequences, the right hand introduces scissors to cut the tails, then withdraws, leaving behind a short, tidy knot stack. Throughout, the two other vertical incisions on the pad remain untouched, underscoring that the entire effort is concentrated on this single rightmost line.

Midway through the recording, the closure at the upper portion adopts the same disciplined cadence but with subtle variations in how the suture is managed. There are intervals when the driver is used to pull the suture through and to manipulate loops while the needle is still mounted, conserving motions and keeping the field controlled. The right hand manages tension and lays the strand laterally to the right to avoid cluttering the wound. Where forceps are used, they are applied judiciously to evert tissue at entry and exit points; where they are not used, the driver and suture tension alone maintain edge alignment. Bites remain consistent in depth and distance from the margin, and prior stitches maintain approximation in segments already closed.

As the uppermost portion is approached, setup frames show both hands opposing each other across the wound—the right hand with tissue forceps presenting the superior right edge, the left hand advancing with the needle. The needle tip is oriented toward the open segment at the top, ready to enter at the marked point. In the following sequences, the needle passes through the near edge, then across to the far side, with the driver regripping to follow the curve and retrieve the needle. The strand is drawn through as the right hand adjusts tension to seat the loop evenly. The closure line, now populated with multiple knots and short tails centrally and distally, advances further toward the top.

Throughout this upper run, there are also segments devoted entirely to securing and trimming previously placed stitches without taking new bites. The driver grasps a suture end to form loops; the assisting hand pulls laterally to maintain a clear angle, then the throws are seated down the driver shaft onto the wound. Scissors enter to trim tails flush to the knot. In these moments, the needle is not being driven; it may be parked off to the side or outside the field. These finishing steps ensure that each stitch—whether recently placed or not—is consolidated before the line advances further.

In later sequences, the stitch line is described as a continuous progression with loops that appear locked as the operator advances superiorly. The left hand holds the driver just above the top third of the incision while the right hand manages the long strand lateral to the wound, pulling slack through after each pass and tensing the suture to maintain edge coaptation. Bites remain perpendicular, with consistent spacing and depth, and tightening produces mild eversion. Where noted, the driver pronates/supinates to follow the curve smoothly and is then reloaded to draw the needle through. After each pass, the operator secures the segment by tightening the loop; some frames emphasize locking or securing behaviors at the leading edge of the closure. Even in these sequences, the hands stay aligned along the wound axis, working within a few millimeters of the superior bite point. When trimming is required, scissors approach from above, perpendicular to the incision, and tails are cut short.

This late run includes intervals of tightening and “locking” at the cranial end without a new pass, followed by resumption of needle driving to add the next segment. Forceps occasionally reappear to assist with eversion and to guide the needle across the open superior segment; at other times, suture tension alone maintains alignment. The operator’s hand positions evolve fluidly: left hand consistently controlling the driver over the incision, right hand alternating between pickups for edge control, the free strand for tension, and scissors for trimming. The driver is used both to pass the needle and to manipulate suture during ties, often parking the needle temporarily to optimize loop control. The suture is kept lateral to the right to maintain a clear field, with loops and limbs managed to avoid crossing the other, unused incisions.

Near the end, the last visible passes and securement maneuvers occur at the very top of the right-sided slit. The wound edges here are gently lifted with pickups when needed; the needle is driven in a controlled arc through the marked points, and the strand is drawn through. The operator then tightens and secures the final loops just millimeters above the superior margin, with careful attention to seating and alignment. A terminal sequence of throws is performed to finish the line. The left hand may briefly switch to scissors to trim; the right hand stabilizes the short and long limbs during the cut, ensuring tails are neat and unobtrusive.

Final frames show the wound at rest with no active manipulation: instruments are away from the field, or momentarily parked at a distance, and the rightmost incision displays a nearly continuous closure. The mid-to-lower portion is secured with neatly trimmed knots; the upper portion has been advanced and tightened with the latest stitches, and the edges are approximated with mild, even eversion where sutures are present. Any small gaps noted earlier near the extremes have been minimized as the line progressed superiorly. The two adjacent vertical incisions on the left remain completely untouched from start to finish.

Across the entire procedure, several themes are consistent:
- The work is confined to the rightmost vertical incision, from initial placement through sequential advancement, securement, and trimming. No other incision is manipulated at any point.
- The operator maintains orthogonal needle entry, grasping the needle at the proximal third and following the curve with controlled pronation and supination. Regripping is used as needed to preserve a smooth arc and to pull the suture through without tearing.
- Edge handling is precise and gentle. When pickups are used, they evert rather than crush. When they are omitted, tissue alignment is maintained by suture tension and the positioning of the needle driver.
- Tying is executed predominantly with instrument throws. The driver alternates between holding the needle and grasping a suture limb to manage loops; throws are seated directly over the wound axis to prevent gapping. Tails are trimmed short with scissors approaching perpendicular to the incision.
- Spatially, hands oppose each other across the wound to triangulate during passes, then cross over the incision during ties to square the throws. The free strand is kept lateral to the right to maintain exposure. The driver typically hovers just superior/left of the active bite site.
- The technique remains coherent throughout. Early segments emphasize discrete passes, tying, and trimming at successive levels; later segments show the line advancing superiorly with sequential tightening and locking behaviors at the leading edge, followed by finishing throws and tail management. Where individual frames momentarily suggest different appearances of the stitch pattern, the overall workflow remains consistent with a single, continuous plan for closing this one incision.

By the conclusion, the rightmost vertical slit is closed along its length with evenly spaced bites and secure knots. The edges are coapted without inversion, with slight, appropriate eversion at the stitch sites. Tail lengths are trimmed short. Instruments withdraw, leaving a stable, neatly finished suture line confined to the single wound that has been the exclusive focus from the first pass to the last trim.
