COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure focuses on the leftmost vertical incision of the practice pad — a short full‑thickness linear defect located in the left third of the model. From the first frames through the last, the operator repeatedly returns to and advances closure along that single incision, placing sequential skin stitches to approximate the dermal/epidermal edges. The work is performed with standard two‑handed instrument technique: a needle driver (needle‑holder) in one hand and fine toothed tissue forceps/Adson‑style pick in the other. Throughout the video the team keeps movements compact and controlled, operating within a working envelope of roughly 1–4 cm over the wound to maintain precise needle trajectory and edge apposition.

Initial passes and setup (0–44 s)
At the outset the incision is open and anchored at its ends. The operator begins at the inferior end of the left vertical line. Early frames show the left hand presenting a curved suture needle with the needle driver held roughly perpendicular to the skin while the right hand steadies the inferior edge with forceps. The needle is grasped near the body (proximal to the tip in some views, near mid‑shaft in others) to allow controlled rotation as it is driven through the synthetic dermis from one side of the incision to the other. Bites are deliberate and shallow-to-middermal: the forceps tent and evert the skin margin so the needle takes a close bite (typically 2–3 mm from the epidermal edge) and exits on the opposing margin. After each pass the suture limb is pulled through and prepared for knotting; the operator routinely ties individual interrupted knots and trims suture tails, securing each bite before moving to the next nearby site. Hands remain close together (≈2–4 cm) for needle transfer and immediate suture management.

Moving along the lower and mid portions (45–149 s)
Work then progresses along the lower and mid portions of the left incision. The dominant‑hand needle driver consistently presents the curved needle in an arc that transfixes the tissue while the nondominant hand uses toothed forceps to elevate and evert the opposing margin. In several sequences the driver holds the needle near its midbody to produce smooth rotation through tissue, while in other moments the grasp is closer to the swage to pull suture tails with more leverage during passage. The operator alternates between taking new passes and finishing previous stitches: some frames emphasize advancing the needle and pulling a loop through, whereas others show knot‑tying and trimming operations. Tissue handling is consistently atraumatic — brief, precise pinches with the forceps to approximate and slightly evert the edges without crushing the synthetic dermis.

Throughout this phase the technique is predominantly simple interrupted skin stitches placed sequentially along the incision. Needle orientation varies slightly depending on the side of approach — occasionally perpendicular to the wound for a direct transfixing bite, at times oblique to capture an epidermal/subepidermal purchase — but the goal is uniform edge eversion and close apposition. Instrument spatial relationships remain tight: the driver typically approaches from a superior/medial direction while the forceps sit lateral/inferior, their tips meeting within a couple of centimeters over the bite site. The non‑dominant hand’s role remains principally stabilization and receiving the needle tip when necessary; it also manages suture tails and provides counter‑traction while the driver withdraws the needle.

Superior progression and refinement (150–239 s)
As the operator advances cranially up the incision, knot‑securing and suture management become more frequent in the recording segments. Some frames specifically highlight the operator finishing the most superior stitch in the column: the needle driver and forceps work in close tandem to tension, tie, and trim the recently placed interrupted suture. Grasp points on the needle vary—sometimes proximal to the tip to allow a tighter pull when seating the knot, other times near the swage for stable rotation during passage. The left vertical wound progressively fills with evenly spaced stitches; adjacent prior stitches maintain edge apposition while the operator adds the next interrupted bite.

Spatially, hand positions exhibit a subtle evolution. Early passes show both hands nearly level and close to one another; as the operator advances, the hands occasionally separate more (up to 10–15 cm in one descriptive frame) when one hand momentarily moves to control suture slack or to reposition instruments, then come back together for the next bite. This separation reflects practical suture management rather than a change in technique: the dominant hand continues to manipulate the needle; the nondominant hand provides tissue control and suture handling.

Consistency of the method remains high: bites are placed close to the incision edge with slight eversion, aiming for epithelial edge alignment. There is no evidence of deep fascial or subcutaneous closure — all activity is limited to epidermal/dermal layers on the practice pad. The operator’s knot‑tying routine is systematic: pull the suture limbs to seat the stitch, create a secure square knot (or surgeon’s throw variations), and then trim tails with scissors as needed.

Mid‑procedure nuances and a brief discrepancy (240–299 s)
Continuing into the mid and latter stages of the case, the operator persists with the same stitch‑by‑stitch approach. Hands and instruments remain coordinated: a needle driver presenting from the superior or superior‑lateral direction and forceps controlling the near edge from the lateral/inferior aspect. Small adjustments in needle grasp (near mid‑shaft versus proximal to the swage) are used to refine needle rotation and removal, particularly as the remaining gap decreases and finer control is needed to avoid puckering.

One segment of the footage briefly suggests a different suture behavior: in a sequence the thread appears to be advanced in a continuous fashion from the superior toward the inferior end in a flowing line. This single observation is inconsistent with the rest of the video, which overwhelmingly shows interrupted, sequential stitch placement with individual knotting and trimming. Given the predominance of interrupted stitch maneuvers elsewhere, that continuous‑looking moment likely reflects suture repositioning, pulling of multiple tails, or a transient step in suture retrieval rather than a deliberate conversion to a running technique. Despite that isolated appearance, the operator maintains an interrupted stitch workflow for the remainder of the case.

Technique sharpening and final bites (300–310 s)
In the final frames the operator concentrates on the superiormost portion of the left incision, closing the last remaining gap. Both gloved hands gather at the top of the wound: the needle driver brings the small curved needle across in a classic interrupted arc while the forceps everts and steadies the opposing edge. The needle is driven through full thickness of the simulated dermis in a controlled pass and the suture tail is drawn clearly through so the operator can tension, tie, and secure the last stitch. Throughout this finishing step the same principles seen earlier are evident — minimal tissue crush, careful edge eversion, bites close to the epidermal margin, and compact instrument movements to maintain suture line symmetry.

Hand positions over time: a compact choreography
Across the entire case the hands exhibit a compact choreography that evolves only modestly. Initially both hands are adjacent near the inferior incision, coordinating needle insertion and tissue stabilization. As the operator progresses cranially, the hands rhythmically alternate between close‑quarters coordination (1–4 cm separation) during needle passes and slightly wider separation when one hand manages suture tails or prepares trimming instruments. The dominant hand consistently functions as the needle driver, providing controlled rotation and passage of the curved needle; the nondominant hand consistently controls tissue apposition, receives the needle tip when needed, manages suture tension, and performs trimming or knot handling. Occasionally roles shift subtly (for example, if a needle must be held more medially while the opposite hand manipulates the tail), but the overall two‑handed pattern remains stable.

Quality, consistency, and final appearance
Throughout the procedure the operator aims for consistent dermal approximation with slight eversion to promote edge‑to‑edge epithelial contact. Bites are superficial to mid‑dermal, appropriate for cutaneous closure on a synthetic pad, and the tissue is handled in a atraumatic fashion. The stitching pattern is predominantly simple interrupted: each bite is passed, tensioned, tied, and generally trimmed before the next adjacent stitch is placed. Occasional frames showing a more continuous thread line are noted as an inconsistency in the recording but do not reflect a persistent change in technique.

By the end of the recording the entire left vertical incision is closed by a series of closely spaced interrupted stitches. Previously visible gaps are eliminated, the wound edges are apposed with gentle eversion, and the suture tails have been managed and trimmed in most locations. Instrument positions relax slightly as the final knots are seated and excess thread removed. The result is a neat, uniformly approximated cutaneous closure along the leftmost vertical incision — a methodical, controlled execution of interrupted skin suturing with careful tissue handling and consistent instrument coordination from the initial inferior passes through the final superior tie‑off.
