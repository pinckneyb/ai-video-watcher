COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single, cephalad transverse skin incision on the practice pad — the short horizontal wound in the upper third of the model. From the first frame through the last, the operator returns to and works along this same superior incision, sequentially placing and securing stitches to close the defect. The work is consistently two‑handed, with a needle holder/driver and fine tissue forceps used in close, coordinated fashion. Over the recording the operator alternates needle grips along the shaft (from near the tip to mid‑shaft/proximal), consistently follows the curve of the needle in controlled arcs, and manages suture tails and knot formation as each stitch is completed. Although a few isolated frames suggest a continuous running pass or show activity on adjacent incision lines, the dominant and continuous activity is placement of individual transcutaneous bites along the top incision, followed by tensioning and knot management.

0:00–0:14 — initial approach and first bite
The sequence opens with the surgeon positioned over the superior transverse incision. Hands are close to the wound (about 1–2 cm apart); the left hand holds a slim needle driver coming in from the upper‑left and the right hand controls Adson‑style tissue forceps from the upper‑right. A curved surgical needle is grasped near its body in the needle driver with the convex curve directed toward the receiving forceps. The forceps tent the epidermal edge while the driver advances the needle in a shallow arc through the opposite lip. Small, full‑thickness dermal bites are taken; the suture material is pulled through and a short loop is externalized, indicating placement of the first interrupted stitch at the superior margin of the incision. Tissue is handled gently with light eversion to present the dermal edges for precise approximation.

0:15–0:29 — reinforcing the proximal superior margin
Immediately following the initial pass, a similar two‑instrument technique continues at the same superior incision. The nondominant forceps maintain edge control and mild eversion while the needle driver — now held in the operator’s right hand in some frames or the left in others depending on approach — grips the curved needle close to the tip and drives it through the dermal layer in a perpendicular‑to‑oblique trajectory. The bites remain superficial to mid‑dermis on the model, focused on edge apposition rather than deep tissue. The suture strand is drawn through and prepared for knot‑tying; the operator keeps hands within a few centimeters of the wound for precise control.

0:30–0:44 — coordinated passes and management of suture line
The operator continues sequential bites along the superior incision. In these frames the needle is again held near mid‑shaft, the tip directed downward, and rotated through the dermis in short, controlled arcs. The forceps repeatedly grasp the near edge to maintain eversion; the driver arcs the needle from the near to far margin. The suture strand is looped across the wound as each pass is completed and the operator pulls the filament taut, keeping consistent tension on the newly formed stitch. Although there are transient appearances of a continuous loop of suture along the incision in some frames, each documented needle pass completes a discrete transcutaneous bite consistent with sequential interrupted closures.

0:45–0:59 — continuing serial closure and maintaining eversion
Work proceeds along the superior incision, again with the driver and forceps converging over the wound at a narrow angle. The needle is grasped roughly one‑third to one‑half from the swaged end and oriented tip‑down to pass a dermal bite with minimal tissue puckering. The operator lifts the near edge slightly with forceps while advancing the needle through the opposite edge; each pass results in a short suture strand drawn through and readied for securement. The hands remain in very close proximity (≈1–2 cm), instrument tips crossing over the wound to control needle trajectory and edge apposition.

1:00–1:14 — additional bites along the same horizontal line
The procedure advances slightly medially along the same superior incision. The left hand now frequently assumes the needle‑holding role in some frames, while the right hand manages the forceps; regardless of laterality, the motion pattern is consistent — forceps tent the near edge, the driver advances the curved needle through the dermis in a controlled arc, and the suture limb is pulled through. Several previous entry/exit marks and earlier stitches inferior to the current site are visible, indicating sequential placement of multiple interrupted stitches along the same incision line.

1:15–1:29 — steady repetition and suture loop handling
The operator maintains a steady rhythm. Needle position varies from mid‑shaft to near the tip, chosen to optimize curvature and bite depth; the driver often rotates to follow the needle arc and reduce tissue drag. The forceps’ grip is precise and gentle, everting and aligning the epidermal lips for a clean coaptation. The suture loop is managed by the non‑driving hand or by temporarily resting it on the pad as the operator withdraws the driver and prepares to tie each stitch.

1:30–1:44 — reinforced bites and beginning of knot sequence
At this stage the operator continues to place bites near the superior center of the same incision, pulling the suture through and beginning manipulations to prepare for knot formation in some passes. The needle is generally grasped toward the proximal portion to enable controlled extraction and to reduce the risk of needle slippage. The non‑driving hand alternately controls the suture tail, provides counter‑tension, or manipulates tissue to maintain good edge eversion.

1:45–1:59 — continued single‑line closure with tight coordination
The pattern of lifting the near edge with forceps, driving the curved needle across the wound, and pulling the suture through is iterated at additional sites along the superior incision. There is consistent attention to modest eversion of the edges and shallow bites through the simulated dermis to avoid puckering. The operator remains within a narrow working zone — hands nearly bracket the incision with coordinated, compact motions.

2:00–2:14 — sequential placement and occasional preparation of instruments
Work proceeds along the same transverse line; needle passes are completed and suture tails externalized. A spare hemostat or scissors appears at the table edge but remains unused while the operator focuses on placing and securing each stitch. At times the operator picks up and reorients the needle holder/hemostat at the table, but the pattern of sequential interrupted bites continues uninterrupted on the superior incision.

2:15–2:29 — further passes with consistent arc and bite depth
The operator again uses the needle driver in a near‑perpendicular orientation, rotating the needle through the tissue and withdrawing it while keeping the suture loop taut. The forceps maintain approximate 1–2 cm separation from the driver tip, providing precise tissue presentation. Bites are repeatedly placed close to the wound margin and drawn through to create clean, edge‑to‑edge apposition.

2:30–2:44 — small changes in hand approach; continuity maintained
There are small positional variations: at times both hands approach the incision from the right side of the pad; at other moments the driver approaches from above/medial. Despite those minor changes, the same incision receives successive interrupted stitches — each pass followed by tensioning of the suture limbs and preparation for knot tying. The operator’s technique emphasizes consistency: controlled needle arcs, modest eversion with the forceps, and short bites of dermis.

2:45–2:59 — additional interrupted passes near prior stitches
The operator places another stitch slightly lateral to previously placed closures, preserving uniform spacing and consistent depth to maintain an even coaptation line. The non‑driving hand frequently manages the suture tail or lifts tissue with a fingertip to keep the working field clear. These frames illustrate the methodical progression of serial interrupted sutures along the superior incision.

3:00–3:14 — appearance of more discrete closures; parallel rows below referenced
While the superior incision remains the focal line, some frames document activity on neighboring rows and show preexisting interrupted sutures inferior to the current bites. Nevertheless, the operator keeps returning to the superior transverse defect, adding another interrupted stitch adjacent to earlier ones at the same incision. Needle grips in these frames are often proximal to mid‑shaft, which facilitates smooth passage through the synthetic dermis and controlled withdrawal.

3:15–3:29 — management of suture tails and commencement of knotting on completed bites
As the sequence progresses toward the later third of the timeline, the operator begins to manage and secure stitches that have already been passed. In several frames the right instrument holds the needle or suture while the left hand (or fingertip) controls the free strand, preparing to perform throws. Knot formation and tightening appear more frequently, with the needle driver and forceps working closely to fashion secure knots and trim or tuck tails.

3:30–3:44 — knot tying and suture security on the right lateral portion
Clearer evidence of knot‑tying appears here: the right hand holds the needle driver/curved hemostat just lateral to the incision while the left hand manipulates the free suture, aligning loops and pulling successive throws. One interrupted stitch on the right side of the superior line is being tightened and tied; the operator uses the left forceps to control the suture loop and the driver to pass and secure throws. The stitches already in place bring the superficial edges into close apposition with modest eversion.

3:45–3:59 — continued tying and suture tail control
The surgeon proceeds to tie and dress several of the recently placed interrupted sutures along the superior incision. The driver is used both to manipulate the needle for final passes and to perform knot‑forming motions; the second instrument holds and pulls the tail to generate and secure square knots. Hands remain concentrated over the right lateral portion of the incision while multiple knots are completed sequentially.

4:00–4:10 — concluding manipulation and preparation to finish
In the last frames the operator finalizes remaining knot tightening and prepares to trim or reposition suture tails. Instruments are gathered and reoriented from the left, and a left‑handed grasp on a hemostat is briefly seen as an approach to secure or remove a needle or to control an instrument for final adjustments. Throughout, the superior incision shows a line of closely spaced, evenly placed interrupted sutures with wound edges approximated and modestly everted.

Technique evolution and consistency
From start to finish, the operator maintains a classic two‑handed surface closure: a needle driver controlling the curved needle and tissue forceps providing precise edge manipulation and counter‑traction. Needle grips vary pragmatically between tip‑proximal and mid‑shaft holds to accommodate the curvature and the depth of each bite; orientation shifts naturally as the operator moves along the line, but the motion remains a controlled arc following the needle’s curve. Bites are consistently superficial to mid‑dermal on the synthetic pad, placed close to the wound margin to achieve edge‑to‑edge apposition without excessive puckering. Early frames show the initial placement behavior; later frames reveal more time spent on knot formation, suture tail management, and securing the line.

Hand position changes and spatial relationships
Throughout the case, hands remain close to the incision, generally within 1–4 cm of the wound edges. Initially the driver approaches from the upper‑left and the forceps from the upper‑right; as the operator advances along the incision the approach varies between medial and lateral entries and occasional right‑side approaches, but both instruments always converge at a narrow working triangle directly over the incision. The non‑dominant hand alternates between holding forceps to evert the near edge, controlling suture tails, and stabilizing tissue with a fingertip. The dominant hand alternates between needle driving, knot‑tying, and temporary suture management. Instrument crossings above the wound are common and controlled, allowing precise needle arcs and reliable closure.

Suture progression and final state
The wound closure progresses in a methodical, sequential fashion: discrete transcutaneous bites are passed across the superior incision, each followed by externalization of suture material, tensioning, and preparation for knotting. As time advances the operator secures multiple throws on each stitch and trims or organizes tails, culminating in a line of interrupted sutures running along the entire length of the superior incision. By the end of the recording the incision is approximated with evenly spaced stitches and modest eversion; multiple knots are in place and suture tails are managed, indicating completion of the primary closure of the superior transverse defect.

Notes on observational inconsistencies
Across the recording there are a few frames that briefly suggest placement of a continuous running pass or show activity on adjacent (middle) incisions. These instances are isolated and intermittently obscured by instrument positions or framing; they do not alter the overall pattern of discrete, sequential interrupted closures that predominate on the superior incision. Those discrepancies are noted but do not detract from the clear, continuous effort to close the superior transverse wound using controlled needle arcs, consistent tissue eversion, and stepwise knot formation.

Overall, the operator demonstrates a steady, deliberate technique: precise tissue handling with Adson‑style forceps, controlled needle arcs with the driver, consistent bite depth to approximate dermal layers, and systematic knot tying to secure each interrupted stitch. The superior incision is ultimately closed along its length with evenly spaced sutures that restore close edge apposition and modest eversion, and the working field is cleared and instruments repositioned as the closure is completed.
