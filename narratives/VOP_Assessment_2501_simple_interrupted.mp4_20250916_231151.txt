Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Final field shows 4 completed simple interrupted sutures on the right incision. The work demonstrates solid fundamentals: orthogonal needle control, symmetric bites, and gentle edge management. Instrument ties are deliberate and square, with knots dressed cleanly and tails cut to an appropriate, consistent length. Your pacing and organization are competent, but there is room to tighten efficiency. Plan stitch placement to maintain absolutely uniform spacing and bite depth, keep the strand consistently parked to avoid repositioning, and streamline the tieâ€“cut cycle. Extend the line methodically to complete the closure with the same spacing and tension you achieved in the central portion. Overall, technically sound and safe, but you can raise the bar with more consistent spacing and crisper economy of motion.
