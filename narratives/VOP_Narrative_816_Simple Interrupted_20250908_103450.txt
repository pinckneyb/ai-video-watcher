COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a calm setup phase. From 0.0–14.0 s, the operator brings both hands into the field and establishes roles: the left hand controls a needle driver with a curved needle loaded roughly at the proximal-to-mid third, while the right hand introduces Adson-like forceps to steady the left edge of the central incision. The needle is oriented near-perpendicular to the epidermis with the suture arced cleanly above the pad, signaling readiness for a standard simple interrupted pass.

By 15.0–29.0 s the scene shifts into knot management for an already placed stitch: two needle drivers appear, the left acting as the post at the left wound pair while the right driver executes instrument ties. Throws are formed around the post, the free end is seized and drawn through, and counter-tension squares the knot centrally. That flow continues through 30.0–44.0 s on the middle incision: the left-hand driver ties, the right hand manages the short tail with fingers after setting the forceps aside. Loops are alternated to avoid crossing and to keep the knot flat. Through 45.0–59.0 s the needle stays parked; the right hand finishes the sequence by trimming tails while the left driver stabilizes the knot.

At 60.0–74.0 s both hands briefly hold scissors to trim the central knot precisely, then clear instruments to the right. The left hand re-enters with a gold-handled driver and draws suture into the superior-left quadrant, readying for the next action. In 75.0–89.0 s the right hand returns with atraumatic forceps, presenting the needle by its body while the left driver loads it correctly at the proximal-mid third. The forceps gently steady and evert the tissue, positioning for an entry a few millimeters from the margin.

From 90.0–104.0 s, a clean, right-to-left bite is taken on the central incision. The left forceps lift the near dermal edge, the right-hand driver advances the needle in a controlled arc, then regrips to complete the pull-through. The long strand is drawn out and the needle is parked safely, setting up for tying. That tying sequence fills 105.0–119.0 s: the left driver becomes a tying instrument, alternately oriented vertical and oblique. The right hand manipulates the long and short ends, reversing loop direction between throws to square the knot and seating each throw symmetrically over the midline.

At 120.0–134.0 s, the left driver holds the standing strand fixed while the right hand crosses in with scissors to cut close to the knot, then withdraws. Immediately after, in 135.0–149.0 s, both hands re-enter to reload the needle. The right hand steadies the needle body with pickups, the left driver opens and closes to find the ideal grip at the distal-mid third and aligns the curve perpendicular to the incision, setting up for a right-to-left pass.

Between 150.0–164.0 s the action returns to tying over the central mark, with the left driver acting as the post and the right switching to a second driver to lay alternating throws; then the left hand reloads the needle for the next pass. From 165.0–179.0 s the driver takes another bite in a measured, curved motion across the wound without forceps on the edges, regripping as needed to maintain the needle’s trajectory. No knot is tied yet; the priority is passage and controlled pull-through.

The knot is then secured and finished between 180.0–194.0 s: the left driver pinches the standing part to maintain tension while the right hand brings in scissors to trim short tails after seating the knot over the puncture line. With that stitch completed, 195.0–209.0 s shows setup for the next pass—right hand with the driver reorients the needle for a right-to-left trajectory, left hand corrals the suture to keep it untangled and ready.

A full, classic pass-and-tie sequence unfolds from 210.0–224.0 s. The left hand now holds tissue forceps, gently everting the near edge as the right-hand driver delivers the needle perpendicular to the dermis, regrips to finish the exit, then transitions into two-instrument tying: the left driver becomes the post, the right driver executes wraps, and the knot is seated precisely midline. The flow continues in 225.0–239.0 s with efficient alternating throws to form a flat square knot; the right hand then draws the suture laterally while the left hand reorients and reloads the needle for the subsequent bite.

Next, 240.0–254.0 s focuses on tidy trimming. The left driver stabilizes the strand vertically over the wound, the right-hand scissors cut the free end close to the knot, and both instruments withdraw, leaving an orderly line. Between 255.0–269.0 s the right hand holds the curved needle in air—at the proximal-to-middle third—maintaining curvature while the left driver engages the suture near the left incision line, setting up for another instrument tie without contacting tissue. In 270.0–284.0 s the right driver regrips and parks the needle, transitions to hand ties to cinch down the stitch, and in the final frames the left hand brings scissors from the left to cut while keeping instruments clear of wound edges.

The rhythm remains consistent through 285.0–299.0 s: the left driver stays over the centerline, acting as both grasper and knot pusher, while the right hand wraps, passes the short end, and pulls in opposite directions to seat alternating throws. By 300.0–314.0 s, the right hand trims central tails, then picks up forceps to prepare the left incision edge while the left driver holds a properly loaded needle oriented perpendicular for the next pass.

From 315.0–329.0 s the operator ties down sequential throws on the midline—no new bites—keeping the needle parked in the left driver while a right-hand instrument with a red marker manages the free end. After securing the segment, both instruments are placed off to the right and the right hand briefly manages the tail with fingers to remove slack. This theme continues into 330.0–344.0 s: the driver regrips to help pull loops through and alternates tension across long and short ends, advancing what appears to be a continuous closure segment without taking additional tissue bites.

The sequence at 345.0–359.0 s is about finishing and resetting: the left driver maintains vertical traction while the right-hand scissors cut tails close to the knots along the centerline. Both hands then move off to the upper-left to prepare new suture material, reloading away from the wound to keep the field clear. In 360.0–374.0 s, knot tying resumes over the midline with the right hand using Adson forceps to control the free strand and position loops as the left driver forms instrument ties, again seating the knot centrally.

A return to active needle driving follows from 375.0–389.0 s. The right hand positions the needle while the left driver grasps it properly at the proximal third; the needle arcs through the right edge toward the left, with controlled transfers between hand and driver to complete the pass. Immediately after, 390.0–404.0 s focuses on the superior apex: the left driver tensions and locks the topmost loop of what now reads as a running/locking line, while the right hand then brings in scissors to cut close to the final locking point.

There’s a brief reset at 405.0–419.0 s with the field largely quiet; then the right hand picks up a needle driver and brings it over the wound, poised for the terminal securing steps. From 420.0–434.0 s, the right-hand driver holds the needle and manipulates loops for an instrument tie above the tissue; the left instrument reaches in from the upper-left, briefly lifting the left edge early and then repeatedly seizing and pulling the short end through to complete throws centered over the incision.

The closeout accelerates through 435.0–449.0 s: the right-hand instrument draws the needle out of the field, transitioning fully to tying. The left driver stands as a vertical post while the right driver lays sequential throws; the suture is kept elevated to avoid snagging, and knots drop neatly over the midline. At 450.0–464.0 s the right hand completes the terminal knot of a running simple line: it grasps the short limb, forms loops with the long limb guided by the left hand, alternates sides to square the knot, and seats it vertically over the wound apex with even, symmetric tension.

Finally, 465.0–474.0 s shows the last cut and inspection. The left hand steadies the standing strand near the top of the wound, the right-hand scissors trim the free end parallel to the axis, and both instruments withdraw. The right hand briefly palpates along the closure to confirm approximation. The field is left with a clean, coapted midline, short, tidy tails, and no instrument crowding.

Across the full timeline, the technique evolves smoothly between phases: initial setup and tissue presentation with forceps; precise needle loading and wrist-driven passes; frequent parking of the needle to convert the driver into a tying tool; alternating instrument ties (and occasional hand ties) with disciplined reversal of throws to square knots; careful, perpendicular seating of throws with vertical driver posture; and deliberate trimming that keeps visibility high. The operator consistently maintains suture control and spatial awareness—elevating the strand, keeping instruments parallel to the incision, and moving off-field to reload—producing a steady, efficient rhythm from first setup to final inspection.
