COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure centers on a single short horizontal skin incision located in the upper third of the pink practice pad. From the first frames onward it is clear that this same wound is the focus: the operator repeatedly returns to the same transverse defect, building and refining closure across its length by placing and securing a series of simple interrupted sutures. The incision is shallow on the silicone model, with clean, closely spaced wound margins that the operator brings into apposition throughout the case. The work proceeds in a steady, methodical rhythm: needle placement into one side, controlled passage across to the opposing edge, gentle approximation, knotting and trimming — repeated progressively to close the entire defect from its central region outward.

Initial passes and setup (0–60 s)
At the outset the wound shows prior entry/exit marks and an early stitch centrally; the team addresses the proximal portion of the same horizontal incision. The operator is gloved and positions both hands immediately adjacent to the incision. The dominant hand (commonly the right early in the sequence) controls a needle driver; the nondominant hand uses fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson-style) to grasp and tent the near wound edge, provide counter‑traction, and manage the free suture. A curved, swaged suture needle is secured in the driver, usually grasped near the mid‑shaft or just proximal to the swage for control. The needle’s curve is oriented so that a smooth arc will carry the tip from one wound margin to the other; passages are executed with a single controlled arc rather than repeated regrasping whenever possible.

Tissue handling is consistently conservative: the forceps lift and slightly evert the epidermal edge while the needle passes through superficial dermal layers of the simulator. Because of the model, bites are shallow and limited to the dermal/epidermal plane; no separate deep layer approximation is attempted. After each bite, the suture is drawn through, the knot is prepared and tightened, and the free tails are managed with the nondominant hand. Scissors and other instruments lie idle nearby until required.

Building the central row (60–180 s)
As the case progresses the operator fills in the central portion of the incision, placing additional interrupted stitches adjacent to the earlier sutures. Hand positions remain tightly coordinated: one instrument on each side of the wound, tips usually 1–4 cm apart and frequently within 1–2 cm for precise needle transfer. The needle driver approaches from one side while the forceps receive the tip on the opposite side; at times the left and right hands reverse roles depending on the bite being taken. The technique for needle handling remains consistent — the curved needle is gripped mid‑shaft, rotated through the tissue in a short, controlled arc, and brought up through the dermal edge on the far side for retrieval.

Throughout this phase the operator pays attention to margin alignment and mild eversion: the forceps hold the near edge so that, when the suture is tightened, the wound lips invert slightly toward an everted configuration at the knot — a deliberate approach to promote epidermal edge apposition during healing. Movements are small, deliberate and concentrated over the same incision; the hands seldom stray more than a few centimetres from the working site. Occasionally the free suture is pinched between a fingertip and forceps to maintain tension while the needle is repositioned for its next pass.

Filling lateral and superior segments (180–300 s)
After establishing a contiguous row of central closures, attention moves progressively toward the lateral and superior segments of the same incision. The pattern is methodical: a new interrupted stitch is passed adjacent to the previously tied sutures, tensioned and secured, then trimmed as needed. The needle handling approach does not change — curved needle, mid‑shaft grasp, rotational arc — but hand orientation alternates so the operator can approach each bite from the most ergonomic angle. At times the needle driver is held in the left hand and the forceps in the right; at others the opposite is true. This fluid switching of roles allows comfortable needle entry and retrieval as the operator works around the wound’s curvature and toward the edges.

The operator frequently uses the nondominant hand to hold and manipulate the free suture tail, pulling through slack and maintaining apposition before throwing throws. Short, controlled bites through the dermis are favored to avoid gaping; the silicone model limits assessment of true bite depth, and the team appears to account for that by taking consistent, shallow passes that bring the epidermal layers into close contact without excessive tension. Where stitches are already tied centrally, the operator occasionally adjusts loop alignment and tension to ensure even spacing and uniform eversion along the closure.

Finishing passes, knot tying and trimming (300–420 s)
Midway through the recording, activity shifts more toward finalizing stitches and preparing knots. Several frames show the operators securing recently placed sutures: the needle has been passed, the tail drawn through, and the knot-tying sequence begins. Hands move slightly closer together during knot formation and trimming, with the instrument tips often within 1–2 cm of the wound. A small pair of scissors is intermittently brought in to trim tails after the knot is secured.

There are moments where activity appears to involve manipulation and alignment of multiple loops rather than the passage of a fresh needle — the operator checks tension across the repair and repositions strands to achieve consistent approximation. A small portion of the sequence shows what could be misinterpreted as continuous suture handling; however, the overall approach remains the placement and securing of individual interrupted bites. The operator’s needle grips vary slightly — occasionally nearer the swage, sometimes midway along the curve — selected for the best control as the needle is driven through the simulated tissue and retrieved by the opposing forceps.

Approach from alternate angles and refinement (420–480 s)
Later frames illustrate the operator working from slightly different approach vectors. At times the needle driver comes in from the upper-right, at times from the upper-left; the opposing forceps changes sides as needed to best receive and stabilize. These shifts are tactical, allowing ergonomic needle passage as the operator closes the remaining lateral portions of the wound. One hand will often cradle the suture tail to prevent tangling while the other manipulates the needle.

Gentle eversion remains a consistent theme: the forceps tent the near edge prior to passage so that when the loop is tightened the external skin edges evert slightly, which is a recognized technique to promote correct epidermal alignment on closure. Edges are checked stepwise for apposition; if a previously tied loop causes a small ridge or misalignment, it is adjusted before the next stitch is placed. Instruments remain close to the tissue surface throughout, facilitating precise, short arcs of needle motion.

Final tightening, tail management and completion (480–490 s)
In the concluding frames the final suture passes are tightened and suture tails are managed. The operator coordinates both hands on the lateral portion of the incision to draw remaining slack, form the terminal knots and trim tails close to the knot. Throughout this final stage the incision is progressively transformed from a shallow, gaping defect to a neatly approximated closure: the wound edges are uniformly opposed, knots sit on the surface producing slight eversion at stitch sites, and stray suture material has been trimmed.

Spatial choreography and hand evolution over the case
From beginning to end, the operator’s hands remain closely engaged with the same wound. At the start the dominant hand most often controls the needle driver while the nondominant hand steadies tissue; later the operator freely swaps instruments between hands to optimize approach angles for different bites. Hands initially approach from opposite sides of the incision and routinely meet over the wound axis; as the closure progresses and knot-tying tasks increase, both hands congregate more centrally and laterally over the same segment under active manipulation. Instrument tips typically remain within a few centimetres of each other and the incision, emphasizing the tight working space required for precise skin closure.

Consistency and technique refinement
Technique remains consistent throughout the case: placement of individual interrupted sutures taken as short, perpendicular-to‑oblique bites through the dermal plane, with controlled needle rotation and deliberate retrieval by the opposing forceps. The operator demonstrates a steady rhythm: bite, draw-through, evert and approximate, tie, trim, then move to the next adjacent site. Where the silicone model obscures true bite depth or needle tip position, the team compensates with consistent, modest tissue purchase and careful tensioning to avoid undue tearing or gapping. Small refinements are evident: occasional repositioning of the needle grip to improve arc control, minute adjustments of suture tension to equalize eversion, and ergonomic hand swaps to facilitate access to lateral margins.

Limitations observed
Because the procedure uses a synthetic dermal pad, assessment of full-thickness capture or deeper layer approximation cannot be confirmed visually. In a few frames the needle tip or exact entry point is partially obscured by instrument shafts or hand shadows, but these moments are brief and do not alter the clear, repetitive pattern of passing and securing individual interrupted stitches. One brief sequence shows concentrated manipulation of multiple loops — an apparent alignment or tensioning step — that could be mistaken for continuous-suture work; however, the surrounding frames show discrete knot formation and cutting consistent with interrupted technique.

Final appearance of the repair
At the end of the recording the incision is closed across its entire length with a uniform row of interrupted sutures. The wound edges are closely approximated and exhibit slight eversion at each knot site. Suture tails have been managed and trimmed; no gross gapping is visible along the repair. Instruments rest adjacent to the pad after completion, and the suture line presents as a neat, evenly spaced series of surface knots, reflecting careful, repetitive application of simple interrupted suturing on the simulator model.

Overall, the procedure is a focused, stepwise reconstruction of a single superficial horizontal laceration: consistent instrument handling, deliberate needle arcs with mid‑shaft control, precise opposing forceps counter‑traction, stepwise knot-tying and trimming, and progressive work from central segments toward lateral and superior margins until the entire defect is uniformly closed. Despite the model’s limitations in judging deep tissue capture, the operator maintains a reproducible technique and achieves a tidy epidermal approximation.
