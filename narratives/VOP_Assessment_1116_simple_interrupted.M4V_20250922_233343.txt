COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The field opens on a silicone skin pad printed with three parallel vertical guide lines. Only one straight, vertical wound is actually being closed; the other marked lines remain as background landmarks and are not sutured. The closure is performed as a series of simple interrupted stitches placed sequentially along the same wound. Throughout, the surgeon works methodically from one end of the incision to the other, keeping the needle consistently perpendicular to the skin surface, everting the edges with forceps, and tying off individual throws before moving distal. Camera angles, hand switches, and the presence of neighboring guide lines occasionally make the frame composition look busy, but the closure itself stays fixed on one incision from start to finish.

The sequence begins at the superior end of the wound with instrument setup and the first pass. One hand anchors a needle holder—at times seen in the left hand in early sequences and later in the right—while the other hand uses fine tissue forceps (Adsons) to control the skin edge. The curved needle is loaded in the jaws at the proximal third to about two‑thirds from the tip, ensuring robust control for rotational driving. Its tip is oriented orthogonal to the epidermal surface, and the wrist is used to arc the needle through the dermis, following its curve. As the first bite is initiated at the superior pole, the forceps lift the near edge just by its dermal bite point with tip‑only contact to minimize crush, producing the subtle edge eversion that will be repeated consistently throughout the case. The needle enters the near edge and, with a smooth pronation/supination, advances toward the far edge. The forceps then slide across to the far side to present the exit point, matching the entry distance and depth. The suture is pulled through, leaving adequate tail control for tying later.

With the first pass set, the surgeon continues along the same incision, repeating the sequence of reloading, presenting, and passing. The needle is often regrasped along its curve after partial extraction to realign it for the next move; sometimes the driver slides from the mid‑body of the needle toward the proximal third to optimize force transmission. Each pass is placed at a right angle across the wound with symmetric entry and exit relative to the cut edge and to the printed guide dots. The forceps hand and the driver hand straddle the incision, working in opposition to create a stable working triangle. The driver approaches from one side while the forceps present tissue from the other, alternating roles as the needle clears the far edge and is regripped. Between passes, the suture is managed to avoid drag across the surface, and slack is drawn through cleanly.

As the session progresses, the spatial choreography tightens. Instrument tips hover just a few millimeters from the wound edges, maintaining a short working distance that keeps the needle path precise and visualization clear. Entry and exit points mirror one another and align with prior stitches, building a consistent spacing down the line. The forceps’ touch remains light: just enough to stabilize and evert without crushing. Occasionally, the surgeon’s head or hands partially obscure the upper part of the field, but the instrument angles and the motion of the driver reveal that the next bite is being prepared or completed on the same wound segment. Throughout these early passes, scissors lie idle on the left side of the field, only to be picked up later when ties are ready to be trimmed.

A full cycle of pass, tie, and trim is first captured clearly midsequence. After driving the needle through both sides and pulling the strand across, the surgeon forms knot throws using the needle driver and forceps. The driver receives the loop, the forceps hand transfers the free end to complete the throws, and the knot is seated by gently approximating both edges. The emphasis is on bringing the wound together with visible eversion and without ischemic blanching. Once the knot is seated, scissors appear from the left side to cut the tails to a consistent length. The suture ends lie neatly atop the epidermis with the knot centered over the closed gap. With that interrupted stitch completed, the driver is reloaded with the needle and the surgeon advances to the next bite along the same incision.

The most prominent visual theme of the mid‑procedure frames is disciplined repetition. The wound edge is lifted at each planned bite point, commonly coinciding with the pre‑printed dots that guide symmetry. The needle enters at a perpendicular angle, arcs through the dermis, and exits at a mirror position on the far edge. The surgeon frequently repositions the driver along the needle curve to keep the optimal purchase during passage and retrieval. When the needle emerges, the driver’s jaws regrip it at the proximal third to draw the remainder through without bending the needle. The suture strand is controlled either with the forceps tips or, in some sequences, with a blue‑handled pick used to tension the free end while the knot is seated and later to present the strand for trimming. The strand often trails off to one side of the field, managed so it neither entangles the instruments nor drapes across the wound.

As more stitches accumulate along the superior and mid segments, the incision begins to show a row of neatly spaced knots and trimmed tails, each interrupting the line with consistent orientation and spacing. These completed stitches provide partial approximation, making the next bites easier to plan. The surgeon uses them as reference points to maintain equidistant entry/exit spacing. At this stage, hand roles sometimes switch—early sequences show the needle driver in the left hand working across to the right, while later sequences depict a gold‑handled driver in the right hand with scissors hovering or set aside by the left. Despite these shifts, the technique is constant: forceps stabilize and evert; the driver advances and rotates; the needle is reloaded between passes.

Preparation frames interleave with placement frames. On several occasions the camera captures the surgeon reloading the needle for the next throw: the curved metal is grasped securely about one‑third from the swaged end, the tip held perpendicular to the incision and poised over the next intended entry point. The forceps angle toward that site to control tissue, positioning the skin so the needle can follow its arc cleanly. Scissors are sometimes in the non‑working hand as they hover near the field, then are deliberately set down outside the immediate operative zone while the driver maintains control of the needle. These preparation sequences emphasize attentiveness to orientation and approach before committing to tissue passage.

The middle third of the case showcases a steady march of additional bites along the incision. The operator takes care to place each pass at consistent depth and width from the wound edge, then regrips the needle to complete the arc and pull through. With each pass, the far edge is lifted in anticipation of where the tip will exit, a hallmark of controlled rotational technique. This keeps the needle on its natural curve, reduces tearing, and preserves the geometry of the bite. When tying, knot throws are formed with the same cadence as earlier: the driver and forceps cooperate to wrap, tighten, and seat the knot, then the tails are trimmed. At times, the scissors remain unused within particular frames; this simply reflects that the footage captured the pass without the subsequent tie, not a change in technique.

In later sequences, partially completed segments are revisited, and new stitches are added between existing ones to fill remaining gaps. Here the surgeon advances from one side of the wound toward the other, sometimes described as moving from the operator’s left to right, sometimes right to left depending on camera orientation. The surgeon regrips the needle after its tip emerges on the far side, then uses the driver to draw the needle and strand through cleanly, keeping the curve intact. Forceps remain in the opposite hand to present the tissue for exit and to guide the suture through without snagging. The result is a sequence of evenly spaced stitches that approximate the edges with degree of eversion matching the earlier bites. Occasional quick placements alternate with careful preparation frames, consistent with a rhythm of load, present, pass, regrip, pull through, tie, and trim.

The final portions of the sequence emphasize preparation and positioning for continued closure. The incision by now displays multiple completed interrupted stitches along its length, with knot stacks and tails lying neatly to one side. The surgeon returns to the next open gap and reloads the needle in the driver at the proximal third, aligning it perpendicular to the skin and pointing at the superior‑middle segment that remains to be closed. The forceps tip toward the prospective entry site to stabilize and evert the edge; scissors are briefly seen hovering in the off hand and then are set down to the side, outside the immediate field. The driver stays centered over the wound, maintaining control of the needle as the surgeon plans the next bite. Even when the camera captures only the setup and not the passage itself, the spatial relationships are consistent: driver centered over the incision, forceps opposing across the gap, and the suture strand managed so that it trails away without impeding the view.

Throughout the procedure, several elements are conspicuously consistent. The wound edges are always everted by the forceps before the needle enters or exits. The needle is always introduced perpendicular to the skin and advanced by rotation, not by pushing straight through, a key feature of atraumatic, controlled passage. Entry and exit points are equidistant from the cut edge on both sides, preserving symmetry and balanced tension. The surgeon uses previously placed stitches as reference to maintain spacing and alignment. When tying, the knot is seated firmly but without strangulation, and tails are trimmed to a tidy length. The scissors are engaged only after the knot is confirmed, and otherwise rest idle on the flank of the field. The instrument hands remain opposed across the incision with a short working distance, optimizing control.

There are also predictable variations that reflect adaptability rather than inconsistency. At times the needle driver appears in the left hand, advancing from left to right; at other times a gold‑handled driver is in the right hand, advancing from right to left. At moments the operator’s head or hand occludes a portion of the view, particularly during passes taken near the superior portion or when tying. None of these moments change the core technique or the target of closure. Occasionally, the camera frames also include the other printed vertical lines on the pad, and instrument movements may briefly occur near those marks as the surgeon repositions or manages the strand. No sutures are placed into those neighboring lines; they function only as visual landmarks within the field.

By the end of the captured sequence, the wound shows a line of simple interrupted stitches that have progressively approximated its edges. The superior and mid portions display completed ties with trimmed tails; additional gaps inferiorly or between stitches are being addressed as the needle is reloaded for the next pass. The edges lie neatly everted with no excessive gapping, and the bites are symmetric and aligned with the printed guide dots. Every stitch follows the same logic: perpendicular entry, rotational passage, controlled regrasping, symmetric exit, and secure knot tying. The final frames confirm readiness to place another stitch along the same line: the driver is centered with the needle positioned for an orthogonal bite, the forceps are poised to evert the edge, and the scissors are set aside until the next knot is ready to be trimmed. The closure is thus captured in mid‑progress on this single incision, with consistent technique, anatomy of each pass, and instrument choreography maintained throughout.
