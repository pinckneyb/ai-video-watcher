COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session unfolds on a silicone training pad marked by several parallel, straight incisions. From the outset the operator commits to closing the inner midline vertical slit and returns to it throughout, even as the camera or field of view makes that same target appear alternately as “third from the left,” “second from the left,” “second from the right,” or simply “central.” While the surrounding slits are occasionally visible, they serve only as landmarks; the instruments, needle, and suture consistently concentrate on the same longitudinal line. The work proceeds in a standard interrupted fashion, with careful transitions between placing new bites, reloading the needle, instrument tying, and trimming tails, punctuated by methodical adjustments of hand position and needle orientation to maintain consistent entry geometry and edge eversion.

Early on, the operator positions the left hand with a needle driver over the chosen slit while the right hand brings in fine tissue forceps to present the margin. The needle is held on its body roughly at the proximal third to two‑thirds from the tip—secure enough to resist rotation but free enough to allow fine correction—then oriented perpendicular to the skin edge. The right forceps lift and evert the dermal edge so the needle can be rotated through the tissue in its natural arc rather than pushed straight across. In these first passes the needle enters near the lower segment of the line, curves through the dermal/subdermal layer, and is handed off to the forceps or regrasped on exit for a controlled pull‑through. No knot is thrown at this point; the aim is to lay down clean, symmetric through‑and‑through bites and establish an even rhythm and spacing along the wound.

The hand choreography is deliberate and repeats throughout the case. The driver works from one side of the incision; the forceps oppose it on the other, both tips hovering only millimeters from the wound edge to preserve visualization. The driver enters at a near right angle to the skin, advances the needle by rotation rather than driving force, then releases and regrips as needed to recover the correct trajectory for the far side. The forceps alternate between holding the tissue for eversion and receiving the needle tip, then momentarily control the emerging suture to avoid snagging or crossing the field. As bites are completed, slack is cleared and the suture is drawn through with just enough tension to see the edges approximate, but without blanching. Several frames show the surgeon simply reloading and refining the needle angle, a hallmark of measured technique that pays dividends in consistent bite depth and spacing.

As the sequence progresses, the surgeon continues to place new passes along the same line, sometimes entering from near to far, other times from right to left, depending on vantage and how the tissue is best presented at that moment. Where the camera pans to show more of the pad, the line appears as one of four vertical slits; when the view narrows to the inner training rows, the same wound shows up as the central of three. The operator’s behavior confirms the constancy of the target: the instruments always straddle the same slit, and at no point do the pickups manipulate the adjacent cuts. At times the right hand starts by managing the free suture strand and then switches to forceps to lift the wound lip, a smooth transition that keeps the working corridor clear and the suture anterior to the field.

After laying initial passes, the surgeon begins tying. Instrument ties are performed with either a forceps or a second needle holder supporting the standing end while the driver throws and advances loops down to the wound. Throws are squared by pulling in opposing, horizontal vectors across the incision so the knot sits directly over the midline rather than sliding off to one side. The operator frequently parks the needle attached to the thread but out of the wound while tying, an important safety habit that protects the tissue and preserves sterility of the working zone. As each knot is seated, gentle final tension coapts the edges without strangulating them; any residual twist is corrected with slight counter‑rotation of the loop before the knot is laid down. When satisfied with the security and placement of a knot at the midpoint, the tails are trimmed with scissors held by the assisting hand, leaving appropriately short ends.

Throughout the middle portion of the procedure the technique shows refinement in both tissue handling and instrument economy. With each new stitch the pickups grasp only the minimal dermal bite needed for eversion, avoiding full‑thickness pinching that can crush the synthetic edge. Edges are presented in a beveled fashion so the needle’s curvature can be matched to the tissue curve; on the far side the needle is allowed to rotate out in line with the tangent of the curve rather than being levered upward, which reduces the risk of tearing. Reloading becomes brisk and precise: the driver takes the needle two‑thirds from the tip for entry, then after exit the instrument is repositioned to hold the proximal third for controlled pull‑through. Where necessary, the non‑driving hand momentarily re‑grasps the needle body near the swage to steer the arc across the gap.

A notable segment shows a knot being tied at the upper third of the same vertical wound. Two needle holders are used in concert, crossing above the slit to form sequential throws that are then guided down along the suture axis. No tissue is grasped during this tying phase; approximation is maintained by the existing pass. The knot is cinched, tested with a gentle alternating tension to confirm it is flat and secure, and then the needle is reloaded for the next bite. This pattern—place a bite, draw the suture through, square the knot, trim, reload—repeats along the line. On several occasions the surgeon pauses between bites to refine the entry angle or to reorient the suture so it does not drape across adjacent incisions; the thread is kept anterior and lateral, often draped superiorly, to preserve an uncluttered operative corridor.

Midway through, the center of the wound bears a visible knot with short tails, evidence of a completed interrupted stitch. Just inferior and superior to that anchor, new bites are placed. The right wound edge is lifted and everted with pickups while the left‑hand driver approaches at ninety degrees to start the pass. The needle traverses the right dermal edge, crosses the gap, and engages the left edge at a mirrored depth. The suture is then drawn through and parked to set up tying. At another moment, the operator concentrates on the inferior end of the slit, where slightly gaping edges are present; pickups evert the edge and the driver delivers a deep enough dermal purchase to counter the tendency to invert. As each throw is formed, the assisting instrument manages the standing end and the loop to prevent twists. When the knot lands off center, the operator re‑balances the vectors, gently sliding it back to the midline before final cinching.

One brief interlude shows instrument tying over a short transverse nick adjacent to the same working zone. The needle is parked, and the throws are advanced down onto this short segment, which functions as a contiguous point at the lower boundary of the vertical closure. The behavior and tool orientation remain unchanged: the driver forms and lays throws, the assisting instrument holds the standing end, and the knot is squared directly over the small wound edges before work resumes along the vertical line. Immediately after, attention returns to the midline slit, where an existing pass is secured with multiple throws and tails are cut, leaving an orderly, compact knot with no excess slack.

In the latter third of the sequence the central portion of the wound becomes the consistent stage. The instruments space themselves a few millimeters from the edges, and the angles of approach are kept as close to perpendicular as the pad geometry allows. When the right side is more accessible, the surgeon elects to initiate a bite from right to left, regripping the needle after the first turnover to fine‑tune the entry point on the far edge. The forceps elevate each lip in turn to keep the edges everted during passage. The edges coming together demonstrate gentle apposition rather than strangulation; the suture is tensioned just enough to bring the epidermal surfaces flush and the dermal layers in contact. Consistency in bite depth and spacing is apparent as the needle arcs reproducibly through equivalent layers on both sides, maintaining alignment and preventing dog‑ears.

Several segments are dedicated solely to knot management over the center of the slit. A throw is formed, slid down, and seated; the partners then switch roles to lay the next throw in the opposite direction, balancing the knot and locking it. The needle remains attached to the suture but is parked clear of the tissue. The loop control is tidy: the suture arcs over the field without snagging adjacent slits, and the loop is guided straight down to the incision, preventing entanglement with instrument tips. After the knot is completed, scissors are introduced to cut tails; the cut is performed with the blades aligned parallel to the wound so the tail lengths are consistent and unobtrusive.

With the central knot secured and trimmed, the surgeon reloads the needle once more—clamping two‑thirds from the tip, curve perpendicular to the edge—and prepares a fresh bite along the same line. The right hand brings the pickups back to the wound to evert the tissue, and the left‑hand driver begins the arc through the right margin. The suture strand is kept clear, draped anteriorly, and the pass begins, though in this short glimpse the needle has not yet penetrated. The setup is precise: driver to the left of the wound, forceps to the right, both hands aligned and poised a few millimeters above the skin with a clear V‑shaped corridor opening onto the incision.

Across the entire case, the evolution of hand positions reflects the phase of work. During placement phases, the left hand almost always holds the needle driver and delivers the needle; the right hand uses forceps to evert and stabilize, occasionally regrasping the needle on exit to help with controlled pull‑through. During knot tying, the right hand often converts to a needle holder to serve as the tying partner while the left driver lays the throws; at other times, pickups perform that role. This role‑swapping keeps the knot square and allows throws to be laid in alternating directions for security. Throughout, the instruments meet and cross directly over the wound to square the knot, then separate to set up the next pass.

Technique consistency is a strong theme. The needle is always oriented perpendicular to the skin, advanced by rotation along its curvature rather than forced; depth appears symmetric from side to side; eversion is actively achieved with pickups rather than relying solely on tension; and suture management keeps the field uncluttered. Where the camera angle or frame composition makes the wound appear to shift position among the parallel training slits, the instrument behavior—what is grasped, where the loop is seated, where the knot is trimmed—demonstrates that the same vertical line is being methodically closed. Minor variability appears in the degree of forceps eversion and in regrip timing, which is appropriate as the operator adapts to angle and access. When a throw is being tightened, the standing end is kept steady while the loop is advanced gently, avoiding over‑tightening and tissue blushing.

By the end of the sequence, the central segment of the vertical wound shows at least one securely tied and trimmed interrupted stitch at midline, with additional secured ties at the superior portion and fresh bites being initiated adjacent to them. The edges along the worked segments are apposed cleanly with a slight outward roll, indicating proper dermal engagement and surface alignment. Tails are clipped to a tidy length, and the knots sit squarely over the incision, neither riding to one side nor burying into the tissue. The final frames show the needle reloaded and the instruments again straddling the same slit—driver left, forceps right—poised to continue the series of uniformly spaced, perpendicular bites in the same simple‑interrupted pattern. The closure is proceeding in a controlled, stepwise fashion along that single vertical line, with consistent technique, thoughtful hand positioning, and careful knot management yielding a neat, everted approximation of the wound edges.
