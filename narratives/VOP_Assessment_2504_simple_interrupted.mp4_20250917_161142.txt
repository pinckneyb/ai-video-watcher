COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The recording opens on a suture practice pad with three parallel, vertical full‑thickness slits. After a brief scan of the field, the operator clearly identifies the wound to be closed: the vertical incision on the right side of the pad. A gloved hand enters from the upper right and points directly at this right‑sided slit, visually confirming the target while the other two parallel cuts are left alone. No instruments or suture are yet in play; this is an orienting moment that sets the plan for the rest of the closure.

What follows are several minutes of quiet staging and global pad handling, captured in short cuts that show the pad being steadied and tension tested without any suture placement. The hands brace the pad and stretch the material to understand how the synthetic tissue opens and how much it will need to be controlled when the bites are taken. This preparatory manipulation occurs mostly around the midline of the pad and the central slit, but no instruments contact the wound edges and no needle appears. The three incisions remain open and unmanipulated during these intervals. At one point a gloved hand hovers at the superior border without touching any wound; at other times both hands stabilize the pad at its margins, keeping clear of the incisions. These are setup intervals, and the right‑sided wound identified initially remains the intended site for the actual closure.

A short vignette then shows instruments poised over the leftmost slit—forceps in the right hand and a needle holder in the left, aligned to take an outside‑in bite near the superior end of that left incision. No penetration follows, and no suture is placed. The sequence reads like a brief orientation rehearsal: a trial presentation of needle and forceps to confirm hand ergonomics rather than a commitment to close that wound. The camera then returns to the right‑sided incision, where the true work begins and continues for the rest of the procedure.

The first definitive suturing sequence on the chosen wound starts in its inferior half. The left hand holds the needle driver; the right hand brings in Adson forceps to evert and stabilize the near edge. The needle is grasped at the proximal third of the curve, its tip oriented perpendicular to the skin to ensure a smooth, rounded path. The driver advances the needle through the first edge, the forceps capture and present the exit point on the opposing edge, and the needle is regrasped to follow its arc across the gap. The suture is drawn through, the ends are evened, and the operator transitions seamlessly to instrument ties. Multiple throws are formed with the driver and snugged neatly, seating the knot over the approximated edges. When the knot is secure, scissors enter briefly to cut the tails short. This first stitch sets the pattern for the remainder: simple, evenly spaced, interrupted sutures with delicately everted edges and short tails.

As the closure progresses superiorly along this right‑side wound, the technique remains consistent but the operator adjusts ergonomics for access to each new site. When working along the mid‑portion, the needle driver is sometimes in the right hand and sometimes in the left, depending on the direction of the pass and how the wrist can best maintain perpendicular entry. Regardless of which hand holds the driver, the needle is consistently gripped on its body roughly one‑third to two‑thirds from the tip, and the forceps lift the dermal edge to present a crisp entry point. Bites are placed a few millimeters from the margin with mirror‑image depth on each side. The needle follows its curve so that both entry and exit occur at close to 90 degrees to the skin, fostering edge eversion and minimizing tissue trauma.

In the mid‑closure sequences, after each pass the suture is pulled through smoothly, the driver releases and re‑grasps as needed, and instrument ties are formed. The non‑dominant hand helps manage loops and, at times, lightly controls the near edge during tightening. The free strand is deliberately kept lateral to the incision and trailed away from the field to prevent entanglement. The operator’s throws are deliberate: the driver tip passes cleanly through the loop to pick up the short end; alternating throws are cinched down to lay a compact, square knot centered over the wound line. After securing each knot, scissors trim the tails to short, tidy ends. The spacing between stitches remains short and uniform, and the edges appose with a gentle, reproducible eversion.

A brief interlude shows a tensioning tool used near an existing knot on the same right‑sided wound. The left hand holds the driver to stabilize the standing end, while the right hand introduces the pusher to snug an earlier throw. This is followed by reloading the needle for the next bite. Again, no deep traction is applied; these maneuvers are about precise control of tension and alignment. Immediately thereafter, the forceps once again take their place just lateral to the wound edge to evert the tissue for the next pass.

The suture line advances in a logical, cephalad direction. After the first stitch in the lower half, the next stitches are placed just superior to the prior knots, and the row marches upward. Passes are repeated in the same fashion: needle presentation perpendicular to the skin, entry on one side with the forceps holding and everting the edge, regrasping the needle to drive through the opposite side, then drawing the suture across and tying. The surgeon keeps working distances short—tips within millimeters of the wound—and the instruments oppose each other across the gap to create a stable working triangle. After each knot is seated, the scissor blades briefly cross the field to trim the tails, and the needle is reloaded to keep the next pass efficient and perpendicular.

There are occasional quiet gaps where only the pad is visible or where the camera lingers on other slits while no actions are taken on them. In a couple of short clips, the central incision is shown with instruments positioned as though to begin a pass. One such sequence demonstrates a needle mounted for a right‑to‑left pass across the central slit with forceps poised on the right lip; another shows a two‑handed sequence taking bites across that central line. These appear as brief demonstrations or practice runs in isolation—no tying, no continued progression, and no subsequent trimming in those zones—whereas the actual, sustained closure with sequential placement, tying, and trimming is consistently on the right‑sided wound. The visual continuity of knots, trimmed tails, the persistent return of instruments to the right incision, and the progressive move toward its superior end anchors the case to this single line throughout.

As work continues up the right incision, several sequences focus on knot security and housekeeping. The driver is used to build throws and seat them; forceps sometimes assist by gently controlling loop orientation or stabilizing the edge while tightening. In a few frames, both hands withdraw momentarily after snugging, reflecting brief pauses to assess edge apposition and to prepare for the next stitch. Scissors appear frequently at this stage to cut tails close to the knots, keeping the field tidy. Each cut is followed by reloading the needle—typically on its proximal third—and reestablishing the perpendicular approach for the next bite.

The superior third of the wound sees the same careful choreography. Near the top, access is tighter and the angles shift: at times the driver works from a slightly superior‑medial stance with the forceps just lateral to the right margin; at other times the driver approaches from upper‑left across the wound while the forceps hold the right edge. Regardless of angle, the needle always meets the skin at close to 90 degrees, the forceps create slight eversion without crushing, and the needle’s arc is followed to completion, preventing lateral shearing. The suture is drawn through in a controlled fashion with the free strand tracked away from the bite site. Throws are placed and tightened with small, precise wrist motions. In one knot‑tying sequence, the driver tip passes through the loop to retrieve the short end—a textbook instrument tie—and the knot is laid flat atop the coapted epidermis.

The row of stitches gradually fills in the superior gap, each new stitch placed just cranial to the previous one. The previously tied knots, with their short tails, mark the progress line; between them, the skin edges are gently everted and well‑approximated. Periodically, the right hand briefly manages the suture tail or loop across the wound while the driver in the left hand continues to form throws. This back‑and‑forth is efficient, and the hands remain in close proximity on either side of the wound, avoiding long, sweeping movements that could snag the thread or traumatize the tissue.

Late in the procedure, the operator continues this pattern at the very top of the right‑sided incision. A new pass is initiated at the superior‑most open segment: the forceps lift the near edge, the needle driver advances the needle in a smooth arc through the dermis, and the tip is regrasped to complete the traverse into the opposing side. With the suture drawn through, tension is applied laterally to bring the edges together without blanching. In some frames the driver works just medial to the right wound edge while the forceps are opposite, and in others the driver crosses the midline of the wound as it exits, all depending on the approach that best preserves the perpendicular trajectory of the needle through the tissue.

The technique remains simple interrupted throughout, and the operator never deviates from this plan. There is no attempt to run the suture or to pick up a different pattern; every stitch is independently placed, tied, and cut before moving on. The spacing remains short and regular, the bites are mirror‑imaged side to side, and edge eversion is consistently maintained by gentle forceps handling. Existing stitches below provide a stable platform and help guide symmetry as new stitches are added above them.

Integral to this steady pattern is the operator’s meticulous suture management. The free strand is kept off the working field—often arcing toward the right side of the pad—so the needle and driver can pass without obstruction. When tying, the driver and forceps (or driver alone) lay turns that are alternated properly, producing compact square knots with minimal slack. When trimming, scissors enter decisively, nip the tails short, and withdraw without contacting the skin edges. On at least one occasion, a knot pusher is used to fine‑tune the seating of a throw, reflecting attention to tension control and knot position.

As the final seconds of the recording capture the superior end of the wound, a new pass is in progress: the driver holds the needle about one‑third from the swage, perpendicular to the skin, and the forceps oppose it to present the bite. The previous row of knots below shows a clean, nearly complete closure with evenly spaced, short‑tailed stitches and slight edge eversion. Edge alignment is maintained without gapping, and there is no sign of tissue crushing or needle track tearing. Although this last pass is not yet tied in the final frames, the technique remains unchanged and consistent with the closure that preceded it, and the wound has been substantially approximated from inferior to superior with a series of simple interrupted sutures.

Throughout, the hands and instruments move in predictable, efficient relationships to the wound: one instrument stabilizes a margin while the other advances the needle; the needle is reloaded to follow its curve; the suture is drawn through and managed laterally; instrument ties are performed in a compact space over the incision; and scissors trim tails before the next bite. Even during brief pauses—when the field is static or when other incisions momentarily appear without any productive action—the momentum returns to the right‑sided wound, and the closure advances in small, even steps.

In summary, the procedure documents a methodical, high‑fidelity simple interrupted skin closure of the vertical incision on the right side of the pad. After initial identification and preparation, the operator starts at the lower portion of the wound and proceeds cranially, placing one stitch at a time with perpendicular needle entries, controlled arc following, and gentle edge eversion using forceps. Each stitch is tied with instrument throws and trimmed to short tails before the next is begun. The hands adapt their positions around the wound as it becomes more crowded near the top, but the spatial relationships—straddling the wound with the driver and forceps in opposition—remain consistent. By the end of the recording, the wound shows a continuous series of neat, evenly spaced knots with mild eversion and stable apposition, and the final pass at the superior end is underway, extending the same disciplined technique to close the last remaining gap. Where the video briefly shows other slits without sustained progress, those moments function as setup or demonstration only and do not break the continuity of the closure being performed on the right‑sided wound.
