Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your motion was disciplined: perpendicular needle entry, clean arcs, reliable regrips at the proximal third, and consistent handoffs produced a steady cadence of drive–retrieve–tie–trim. Bimanual coordination was solid, with the assisting hand creating gentle eversion and the driver maintaining a vertical posture close to the target. Knot work was controlled and centered with alternating throws, and reloading matured to efficient, two-instrument technique.
