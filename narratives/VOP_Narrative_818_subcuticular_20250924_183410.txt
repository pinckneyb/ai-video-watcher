COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The field is a synthetic skin pad with several parallel practice cuts, but the work focuses throughout on the short horizontal wound in the upper third of the pad, just above the longer midline slit. This upper line has clean, straight edges with slight gaping, and early on there is a small triangular opening at the right end that will become a recurring target for precise edge capture and final closure. Other visible cuts remain spectators; the surgeon’s attention, instruments, and suture handling keep returning to the same short superior wound as the line is built, tightened, and finished.

The session opens with deliberate preparation and the first passes. With both hands gloved, the surgeon positions the needle holder and tissue forceps in standard opposition over the right portion of the line. The needle is loaded properly near the proximal third to two‑thirds from the tip, its curve presented nearly perpendicular to the skin, and the right wound edge is gently lifted with Adson-style forceps to evert the margin and expose the dermis. The driver advances in a controlled arc using forearm rotation rather than pushing, following the curvature through the epidermal/dermal interface. Bite size is modest and symmetric, a few millimeters from the edge, consistent with skin closure principles. Suture is drawn across the gap cleanly, with the long limb managed superiorly to keep it off the field.

Working back along the left half of this same upper wound, the surgeon places a stitch across the left segment of the line. Again the forceps are used just at the edge to evert, not crush, the tissue; the needle is regripped as needed to maintain a perpendicular approach and an even arc through both edges. After the pass, the needle is released and regrasped to complete pull‑through. The ends are drawn up and an instrument tie begins centrally over the incision, advancing the knot down to sit flush with the epidermis. Where knot handling and trimming occur at the left end, the driver often “parks” the needle while the off-hand introduces scissors to snip the free tail to an appropriate length. A short tag remains and the edges at that left end look neatly approximated.

As the line advances, the surgeon alternates sides and hand dominance to maintain ergonomic control. Often the left hand holds the needle driver from a slightly superior approach while the right hand, with forceps, steadies whichever edge is being pierced. At other times—especially over the right half—the right hand takes the driver and the left manages the free strand or assists with the needle. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument, the relationships remain constant: instruments oppose one another across the wound, the driver’s jaws approach at right angles to the entry site, and the forceps grasp only the minimal edge necessary for eversion.

Several passes build the central portion of the line. When entering on the near (right) edge, the driver carries the needle through in a smooth wrist arc, then regrips to carry the point across and out through the opposite margin. When starting from the far (upper) edge, the driver approaches from above, aligns the curve perpendicular to the entry point, and the forceps on the near side receive or guide the emerging tip. Each time, suture is drawn across the gap; excess slack is cleared, and the strand is prevented from draping over the field longer than necessary. On a few occasions the suture lies across the incision momentarily or a forearm briefly occludes the view while pulling the strand through, but the line remains controlled and the edges are kept in apposition.

Knot tying punctuates these passes at regular intervals, consolidating one stitch before the next is set up. The surgeon uses instrument ties with sequential throws advanced down to the wound, ensuring each knot sits directly over the incision and holds the slight eversion created by the dermal bites. The throw is formed, the loop is guided by the non-driver hand, and the driver draws it down smoothly to seat without over‑tensioning. Tails are trimmed close with fine scissors. At one point, a ruler appears briefly to check spacing at the right end, reinforcing the practice of evenly distributing stitches along the line.

Keeping the line moving, the surgeon resets the needle repeatedly. Each reload is careful: the needle body is grasped at the proximal third to mid-shaft, never at the tip, and the jaws of the driver are oriented so the needle will enter the skin perpendicular to the surface. When a pass is completed, the forceps may re-grasp the needle to hand it back to the driver in the correct orientation for the next bite. By maintaining this disciplined reloading and hand-to-hand transfer, the surgeon prevents torque on the needle and preserves precise control of trajectory.

Much of the middle phase is spent addressing the right half of the line where a small triangular gap persists at the apex. Here, bites are especially small and symmetric, with the forceps lifting the apex to present both edges. The driver arcs the needle through one margin and then the other, with occasional mid-arc regrips to maintain a clean path through the dermis rather than plunging into deeper simulant. Once both edges are captured, the suture is drawn across the defect; edges come together and evert slightly. A knot may be placed immediately to secure the approximation at this critical point, or the strand is parked while the next bite is set for the adjacent segment, depending on how the tissue behaves. Where a pass is completed and tightened without knotting in that exact sequence, it is followed by preparation for the next throw on the same line—consistent with a methodical progression along a short wound.

The surgeon’s spatial choreography remains consistent throughout. Instruments operate a few millimeters from the wound edges, forming a small working triangle over the line. The needle driver tends to hover just superior or lateral to the wound; the forceps oppose from the other side, either at the right edge when the entry is on the right, or shifting to the left edge to aid retrieval and maintain eversion as the needle exits. When cross‑body pulls are needed to draw the suture through, the free limb is tensioned laterally, sometimes diagonally across the field, then brought back into alignment to avoid obscuring the operative site. On a few sequences, the operator’s head or hair briefly occludes the view, but this is transient and does not interfere with technique: each bite is still placed with perpendicular orientation and smooth wrist-driven rotation.

Progress over the center of the line is marked by a clean, visible knot sitting at mid-incision, followed by reloading of the needle to continue the sequence. The surgeon then returns to the right end, where a series of steps are aimed at closing the last open segment. These include: initiating a bite into the right margin with the needle driver presented from superior‑left; forceps on the right lip evert and expose the entry site; the curve is followed through the dermis; the strand is pulled across; and an instrument tie is formed to secure the stitch. A second or subsequent bite at the right terminus is addressed in similar fashion, each time ensuring the edge is everted and the bite depth mirrors the contralateral purchase so the apex does not invert or leave a dog‑ear.

At the far right, knot tying becomes more frequent. The driver holds the needle after the pass while the other hand—sometimes with forceps, sometimes with the free suture end—helps form loops and snug them down. Throws are seated in sequence to lay flat on the surface. After each knot, scissors enter to trim the tail. The right index finger occasionally palpates the line, checking that the knots are firm and the edges remain evenly approximated without strangulation.

Between these right-end closures, the surgeon periodically pauses to organize the strand, to regrip the needle in preparation for the next bite, or to reposition hands relative to the wound to maintain a comfortable entry angle. While these interludes show no new tissue penetration, they are integral to the overall efficiency of the sequence: slack is cleared, the field is tidied, and the next pass is set up with the needle correctly oriented and the forceps poised at the intended entry site. At times the free limb is drawn obliquely across the wound to snug a recently placed stitch that had been pulled through but not yet fully seated; tension is applied thoughtfully to preserve the slight eversion of the margins.

Even when the camera frame includes the longer midline cut below, the operational choreography, instrument placements, and tightening/tying all repeat on the same short superior wound. Every active bite, reloading maneuver, tensioning, knot, and tail-trim returns to that upper line. Symmetry of bites, perpendicular needle presentation, careful everting forceps work, and consistent instrument ties define the method from start to finish.

In later sequences, as the right end of the line nears completion, there is a notable emphasis on precision: the forceps lift the right edge just enough to present a well-vascularized dermal purchase; the needle holder maintains a right-angle relationship to the skin to avoid oblique or shallow passes; the suture is drawn through with steady traction; and any tendency for the wound edge to invert is corrected by repositioning the forceps and retensioning the suture before the knot is seated. A ruler briefly checks inter‑stitch spacing, after which the operator continues in the same rhythm, alternating between driving and reloading to keep the needle’s curvature aligned for the next entry. The strand is kept clear of the field except when temporarily draped during pull‑through; when it does cross the wound, it is immediately redirected to prevent contamination of the working area.

Once the remaining gap at the right apex is closed with a carefully placed stitch, the surgeon secures it with an instrument tie, trims the tail, and inspects the junction. Another bite may be added adjacent to the apex if needed to optimize edge alignment, following the same perpendicular entry and dermal capture to maintain eversion. As the line consolidates, the hands step off briefly, then return to check that the sequence of knots lies in a consistent orientation relative to the incision and that tail lengths are trimmed uniformly. The final passes in this phase show loops being formed and tightened at the right half, with the needle often clamped in the driver while the opposite hand tensions the long limb to seat the knot precisely over the incision line.

The finishing moments are devoted to housekeeping and verification. Scissors pass along the upper wound to tidy any residual long tags; the driver may lift the strand to make each cut cleanly without nicking the skin. The strand is organized off to one side so it no longer drapes across the operative field. The surgeon’s fingertip lightly palpates along the stitch line, testing that each knot is firm and flush, and that the edges are evenly approximated and slightly everted. No new stitches are added in this final check; the wound already shows a completed series of interrupted closures with short tags and mild, appropriate puckering reflecting sound dermal capture.

Throughout the procedure, the pattern of technique remains consistent. Each stitch is set up with the needle grasped at the proper point on its body, the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin, and the pass driven by a wrist‑guided arc rather than by pushing. The assisting hand uses fine forceps to evert just the wound lip, never crushing or overgripping tissue. The needle is reloaded between passes to preserve the ideal angle of approach. The suture is drawn through and managed to avoid tangles, with occasional lateral pulls to snug a stitch before tying. Instrument ties secure each stitch with sequential throws advanced to the surface, and tails are trimmed promptly. Where small anatomic nuances appear—such as the triangular opening at the right end—the operator adapts by taking smaller, symmetric bites and closing the apex with careful attention to eversion and alignment.

By the end of the session, the short superior incision is fully approximated along its length. The left end shows a tidy early knot with a trimmed tag; the midline bears at least one centrally seated knot demonstrating even spacing and controlled tension; and the right end—once marked by a small triangular gap—is now closed with one or more precise stitches, each tied down and trimmed. The final inspection confirms that the suture line is continuous and coherent, with edges neatly apposed, slight eversion maintained, and no residual gaping. The longer midline and any lower practice cuts remain untouched. The instruments withdraw leaving a clean, well‑closed short horizontal wound across the upper third of the pad, its line of interrupted closures demonstrating a consistent, careful technique from first pass to final trim.
