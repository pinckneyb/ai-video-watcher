Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your motion and flow are controlled and deliberate, with consistent perpendicular entry and measured, shallow dermal bites that maintain eversion. Hand-to-hand exchange matured over the sequenceâ€”early multiple regrips gave way to smoother reloads, and strand management stayed disciplined and out of the working zone. Instrument ties were efficient and square, seating without crossing and providing secure fixation.
