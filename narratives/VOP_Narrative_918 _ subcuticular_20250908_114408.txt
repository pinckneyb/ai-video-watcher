COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
From first frame to last, the video follows a methodical, simple‑interrupted skin closure on a suture pad, showing the full cycle of loading, driving, retrieving, tying, and trimming—repeated across the length of a horizontal incision beneath a previously completed superior row of stitches.

0.0–44.0 s: Establishing the technique and first passes
- The sequence opens with the classic two‑instrument stance: left hand with the needle driver, right hand with Adson forceps. The needle is loaded at the proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the pad. The right hand everts and presents the far edge while the left hand drives the needle in a smooth arc across the gap, then regrips closer to the tip to complete the exit and pull-through (0–14 s).
- The next moments are about setup and economy: the right hand transitions to the forceps full-time to help reload and present the tissue, while the left hand maintains control of the driver and needle (15–29 s). The operator manages slack and reloads two‑handed, keeping the curve orthogonal to the planned entry.
- With the needle reloaded, another pass is taken with careful edge control and perpendicular entry. Forceps stabilize each edge just enough to evert without crushing. After passage, the needle is briefly parked and the suture is drawn through, leaving a controlled tail positioned for tying (30–44 s).

45.0–104.0 s: Building a rhythm—drive, retrieve, manage slack
- The pattern settles in. The left hand remains the driving hand while the right hand alternates between forceps and suture management (45–59 s). Bites are taken from near to far with clean arcs; the forceps retrieve the tip and deliver the needle for reloading.
- The operator then works a few passes without pickups, relying on suture tension and the needle’s arc to approximate the wound (60–74 s), before returning to forceps for precision.
- A brief interlude shows housekeeping: trimming tails on the superior, previously tied sutures (75–89 s), then back to the active midline incision where the left hand positions the needle and the right hand resumes edge control.
- Next, the driver moves to the right hand for a better approach angle (90–104 s). The technique remains consistent—perpendicular entry, guided exit with the assisting instrument, controlled pull-through with a visible, even tail.

105.0–149.0 s: First tying sequences and refined reloading
- With a working length through the tissue, the instruments transition to instrument ties (105–119 s). The driver forms loops centrally over the wound; the assisting hand posts the opposite strand and delivers the short end through. Throws are alternating, and tension is along the axis of the incision to keep the knot centered.
- The left hand then resumes as the driver for another bite and immediately transitions back into tying. The final frames show a trim of the free end, indicating completion of a stitch (120–134 s).
- Suturing continues with right‑hand driver and left‑hand forceps, maintaining orthogonal needle angles and symmetric bite depth. The operator increasingly uses brief regrips along the needle to fine‑tune the trajectory before each pass (135–149 s).

150.0–209.0 s: Sustained, balanced bimanual work
- The next stretch highlights efficient extraction and relay: after the needle emerges, the left hand seizes the body (not the tip), disengages, and helps reload for the opposite edge (150–164 s). The driver stays vertical over the incision for precise control.
- After a quick marking/planning moment, the right‑hand driver and left‑hand pickups close an additional interval of the wound with consistent, symmetric bites (165–179 s). The suture is drawn through without over‑traction; tails remain manageable and out of the needle path.
- From 180–209 s, the choreography is steady: driver mostly vertical and close to the target, forceps everting at the dermal margin, regrasp near the proximal third to continue the arc, and clean delivery of the needle to the assisting hand for extraction and reload. Edges come together predictably as each throw advances.

210.0–269.0 s: Progress, regrips, and intermittent trimming
- The operator maintains perpendicular needle entry and smooth wrist‑driven arcs, crossing the midline only when necessary to retrieve. After each pass, the suture is drawn through in line with the needle’s curvature to avoid bending and tissue drag (210–224 s).
- There’s a mid‑sequence reset where the left hand momentarily switches to scissors to cut a free end after a tie not fully shown on camera, then returns to forceps (225–239 s).
- The next two bites are textbook: forceps present the near edge, the right‑hand driver follows the curve across, regrasp near the tip, and pull-through. The far edge is stabilized for exit, eversion preserved (240–254 s).
- With the line advancing, the left hand again alternates to scissors to trim a tail after pull-through, while the right hand keeps the standing end under control—evidence of interrupted stitches being completed and cut as the operator moves along the incision (255–269 s).

270.0–314.0 s: Preparing for ties and two‑instrument reloading
- Another pass is taken and the driver is centered—posture and suture orientation suggest a setup for instrument tying (270–284 s).
- We then see deliberate, off‑tissue reloading using two instruments: a right‑hand driver holds the needle while the left driver or forceps adjusts the grasp to the ideal mid‑to‑proximal position, all done above the field to keep prior knots and tissue safe (285–299 s).
- A pass follows with left‑hand driver/right‑hand pickups, then both hands each take a needle holder for an instrument‑to‑instrument tie. Throws are formed above the wound and then seated down, keeping tension in plane with the incision (300–314 s).

315.0–359.0 s: Alternating forceps and scissors; steady, economical movements
- The left hand continues as the driver while the right hand rotates between forceps for edge control and scissors for timely trims. Bites remain consistent—few millimeters off the margin, full‑thickness dermal, with slight eversion created by the pickups (315–329 s).
- Reloading is deliberate and controlled, with the right hand setting needle position in the driver before each entry (330–344 s).
- The operator occasionally pauses to manage the suture end by hand, then returns to pickups to guide the next pass. Instruments are parked neatly when not in use, keeping the field clear (345–359 s).

360.0–404.0 s: Staging, instrument changes, and setup for the final tie
- The right‑hand needle driver holds the loaded needle off the wound while the left hand retrieves scissors—prepping for the next cut after the impending tie (360–374 s).
- There is a brief interlude where a capped scalpel is handled away from the tissue and then set aside without contacting the pad (375–389 s), after which the field returns to pure suture work.
- The left hand holds a needle driver near the edge of the pad, with suture visible on the table; no needle manipulation occurs—this is a staging moment, organizing strands and tools for the final tying sequence (390–404 s).

405.0–408.0 s: Final instrument tie and tensioning
- The closing frames show both hands manipulating only suture with instrument tie technique. The right‑hand driver acts as the primary tying tool; the left instrument controls the short tail. Throws are formed centrally and tensioned along the axis toward the lower incision, with the knot not yet fully seated to tissue—suggesting final seating and cut would immediately follow.

Overall flow and evolution
- The procedure progresses in disciplined cycles: load – present – drive – regrip – extract – pull-through – tie – trim. Early on, the surgeon alternates which hand drives to optimize approach angles, then settles into efficient, low‑travel motions with consistent perpendicular needle entry. Tissue handling remains gentle; eversion is created with fine pickups at the margin rather than deep grasps.
- Between captured passes, the operator frequently parks instruments, manages slack, or trims tails, which keeps the working zone clear and the suture line orderly. Reloading evolves from single‑handed adjustments to confident two‑instrument reloading above the field, improving speed and control.
- Knot tying is instrument-based, with deliberate, alternating throws formed above the wound and seated down the axis. The left‑hand driver doubles as a knot pusher when needed, ensuring knots land squarely over the incision without strangulation.
- The rhythm throughout is unhurried and economical—short arcs, minimal crossing, and consistent spacing of bites—culminating in final throws formed and tensioned directly over the midline closure.
