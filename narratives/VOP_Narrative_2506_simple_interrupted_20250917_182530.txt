COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens with quiet setup and orientation, then steadily builds into a methodical closure performed on the same right‑side incision over the course of the video. Early moments show the operator confirming instrument function and loading the needle without entering tissue, and only later do the hands settle decisively onto the rightmost wound to begin the actual repair. From that point forward, all activity remains anchored to the same right‑sided slit, progressing in a consistent, stepwise manner with discrete bites, instrument ties, and tail trimming that mark a series of individually secured stitches along a single line.

Initial preparation and positioning
The very first frames show an exploratory phase over the central incision, then briefly over the left incision, but no tissue penetration occurs. A gloved right hand hovers above the central midline slit with a needle driver appearing transiently and then withdrawing; the left hand is absent from the field. The next glimpse brings both hands into view near the leftmost slit as the operator repeatedly loads and reorients a curved needle about two‑thirds from the tip using a gold‑handled driver while the opposite hand with fine forceps assists with alignment. Even here, the forceps do not engage or evert the wound edges; all contact is limited to needle loading and orientation. This prelude completes the instrument setup and confirms needle control without committing to a bite.

First entry on the target wound: establishing work at the inferior end
Attention shifts definitively to the right‑side vertical incision near the lower‑right corner of the pad. The left hand now holds the needle driver over this slit, the right hand uses Adson/DeBakey forceps, and the first bite is initiated at the inferior edge. The needle is grasped properly on its body (about the proximal third to mid‑shaft) and aligned perpendicular to the skin surface. With the right hand gently everting the near/right wound margin for visualization and support, the left hand rotates the needle through the right edge toward the left. The bite is retrieved, the suture drawn through, and slack is managed without tearing or crushing. Immediately following this pass, the operator tensions the strand, then pauses without tying, repositions, and resumes thread management to organize the field for secure knotting.

Foundational knot work and anchoring
Before additional tissue passes are taken, the operator briefly secures an anchor at the pad’s lower‑right margin. The right hand with the needle driver controls the strand near the pad edge while the left hand retrieves scissors to trim the short tag. No penetration of the incision occurs in this brief interlude; this maneuver tidies the working end and sets up controlled strand management for subsequent bites on the wound itself.

Building the closure from the bottom up: discrete, symmetric bites
Returning to the inferior end of the right incision, the closure continues in a rhythm that becomes the hallmark of the procedure. The left hand with the needle driver and the right hand with forceps straddle the wound; the needle is consistently held around two‑thirds from the tip, near‑perpendicular to the skin, and is advanced with smooth wrist rotation that follows the needle’s curve. Each time, the right hand lifts and everts the dermal edge just back from the margin to present the entry site, then guides or briefly grasps the emerging needle as needed. Bites are placed in mirror fashion on opposing edges at shallow‑to‑mid dermal depth—close enough to maintain tidy spacing next to the prior stitch line, but back from the margin to preserve tissue integrity and achieve subtle eversion.

After each pass, the suture is drawn through, slack controlled, and the stitch secured with instrument ties. The instrument choice and hand dominance occasionally reverse—at times the right hand drives and the left supports, and at other times the left drives and the right supports—but the choreography remains consistent: one hand drives and regrips the needle as necessary while the other hand presents tissue, tensions the standing part, or manages the free end for knot security. Knots are seated slightly to the right side of the incision, and tails are trimmed short using scissors introduced from above or from the left as appropriate. This cadence—bite, pull‑through, tie, trim—defines the working sequence at the lower portion of the slit.

Consolidation and tidy‑up near the initial knots
As the first few stitches accumulate at the inferior end, several “housekeeping” maneuvers ensure a clean field and reliable approximation. In one sequence, the driver parks the needle while the operator completes throws; scissors are then used to trim tails adjacent to a fresh knot. In another, no new bite is taken—as the operator repositions, confirms eversion, and tidies the suture trains around the earliest knots—before resuming placement just superior to the prior stitch. Throughout, the forceps touch tissue lightly and only at need to present the dermal edge; there is no crushing or repeated grasping on fragile points. The prior sutures keep the edges well coapted as the line builds.

Progression through the mid‑portion: consistent spacing and secure instrument ties
Moving above the initial cluster of knots, the same technique continues up the right incision with minor variations in instrument roles. The driver is typically held in the left hand at a superior‑left approach to the wound; the right hand, with forceps, remains along the right/lateral side of the slit to evert the near edge, then alternates to tension the free strand during knot tying. Controlled arcs drive the needle from the right toward the left, with intermittent reloading in the jaws to optimize the entry angle. Where needed, the needle is briefly regripped by the opposite hand to complete passage or to pull the suture through without twisting the line.

Notably, several sequences show the operator pausing without placing a new bite, focusing instead on thread organization, slack removal, or knot security on the previous stitch. In one set, the forceps stabilize the right edge while the driver manipulates loops to square the throw and lay the knot down neatly to the right of the incision. In another, scissors appear only to shorten tails on freshly tied knots while the other hand maintains gentle counter‑traction so trimming does not compromise tension. These interludes keep the closure tidy and avoid excess strand on the field that could snag later passes.

Upper midline and approach to the superior end: precise placement under close control
As the closure advances into the upper mid‑portion of the slit, the operator continues to seat each stitch at a regular distance from the last, echoing the existing spacing. Instrument positions settle into a consistent pattern: the needle driver slightly superior and left of the wound axis, forceps on the right edge, tips within millimeters of the bite entrance. The right hand frequently tented the near/right edge, presenting the dermis at the planned entry point; the left hand executed forehand, perpendicular entries, then regripped the needle and completed the arc across to the far edge. The suture is pulled through in a straight line across the gap and then down to seat the loop.

After tightening, each stitch is individually secured with multiple instrument throws. The driver occasionally crosses the incision during tying, and the forceps provide steady counter‑traction on the standing part to square and seat knots precisely over the wound. Once secure, scissors trim the tails and are withdrawn to clear the view. The other two incisions on the pad remain untouched during all of these steps; the working hands and instruments stay centered on the right‑side line.

Handling transitions and perspective changes without losing continuity
At times the camera angle or hand posture makes the right‑side vertical slit appear oblique, particularly as work reaches the upper end and the operator reorients to keep a perpendicular approach. Even in those views, the behavior of the instruments is unchanged: the driver holds the needle near the proximal third to mid‑body, the needle passes orthogonally to the skin, forceps present and evert the edge, and each stitch is individually tightened and secured. Occasional descriptions of a “continuous line” likely reflect how closely spaced and tidy the stitches appear rather than a change in technique; within the operative sequence, each new bite is followed by discrete tying and later tail trimming consistent with individually secured stitches. During one such perspective shift, the operator completes a pass, tensions the strand, then exchanges the forceps for scissors to trim tails at the most recently seated knot before reloading the needle to continue just proximal to that point. The closure remains locked onto the same right‑side wound throughout.

Short segments dedicated to finishing tasks
Interspersed among the placement sequences are brief windows of pure finishing and line management. In one, only tightening and tail trimming at the distal end are shown—no new bite is taken. In another, the driver parks the needle while the operator completes multiple throws to secure a just‑completed stitch, then returns to regrip the needle for the next pass. A bit later, the operator again attends to trimming tails at a recently tied knot, stabilizing the line with pickups so that cutting does not relax approximation. These tasks occur consistently after each placed stitch and indicate careful attention to knot quality and field organization rather than any departure from the ongoing closure.

Final approach and completion at the apex
The last stretch focuses on the superior end of the same slit. The driver remains just above the wound apex, the forceps stabilize the near edge, and the needle passes in a controlled arc across. After the suture is drawn through and the edges are gently approximated with slight eversion, the operator performs instrument ties right at the top. The throws are squared with the opposing hand to keep them flat and seated in line with the prior stitches. Once satisfied with tension and approximation, scissors are introduced to cut the tails, leaving the knot snug at the apex.

In the final frames, the hands hover briefly over the now‑closed line, then withdraw; there is no further tissue manipulation. Any remaining instruments are parked away from the field. The two other parallel incisions stay untouched from beginning to end, with all functional suturing concentrated on the right‑side wound.

Technique and hand‑use throughout
- Needle handling: Across the entire case, the needle is repeatedly grasped at the proximal third to about two‑thirds from the tip in the jaws of a gold‑handled driver, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin. The driver follows the needle’s curvature during entries, and the operator regrips as needed to complete passages or to improve angle of approach on subsequent bites. When tying, the needle is sometimes left on the strand and parked out of the immediate field.
- Tissue handling: Forceps are used primarily to evert and stabilize the wound edges during entry and to guide needle emergence on the far side. Grasping is light and targeted to the dermis just back from the margin to present tissue without crushing. As the suture is drawn through, edges are approximated with mild eversion; there is no traction on the other practice pad cuts.
- Instrument roles and spatial relationships: The driver and forceps consistently bracket the wound, with the driver usually slightly superior/left of the wound axis and the forceps lateral/right. The tips of both instruments operate within a few millimeters of the edge for precision. During tying, the instruments cross above the wound only as necessary to form, square, and seat the throws. Scissors enter intermittently to cut tails once a knot is secure, then exit to avoid clutter. The suture strand is managed to the right or superiorly to keep the field clear.
- Consistency and progression: The closure proceeds in an orderly series from the inferior end upward, with bites placed immediately proximal to the previously tied stitch. Each pass is followed by tightening, instrument ties, and tail trimming before moving to the next interval. Short sequences devoted solely to tightening or trimming reflect careful finishing on recently completed stitches rather than any change in method. Occasional references to a “continuous line” are consistent with the very close spacing and clean presentation of these sequential, individually secured stitches, not a shift in pattern.

Final state
By the end of the procedure, the right‑most vertical slit is fully closed along its length with multiple closely spaced sutures. Each stitch lies flat with knots seated consistently, generally to the right of the incision, and tails are cut short. The wound edges are well approximated with slight, uniform eversion and no visible gapping between intervals. The superior apex shows a final knot neatly trimmed, and the inferior end remains tidy after earlier finishing. No additional bites are placed after the last trim, and both hands withdraw, leaving a completed, orderly repair on the single right‑sided incision. The central and left incisions remain untouched throughout, underscoring the focused work on one line from initial entry at the lower end to the final tie and cut at the top.
