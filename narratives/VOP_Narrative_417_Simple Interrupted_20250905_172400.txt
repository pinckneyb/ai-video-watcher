COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a synthetic skin pad with multiple incisions. After a brief setup with no hands visible, the right hand in green gloves brings in tissue forceps, followed by the left hand introducing a needle driver. The team orients over the short, lower‑central incision: the right hand positions the driver perpendicular to the near edge for a right‑to‑left pass while the left hand uses forceps to lift and steady the near dermal edge, creating slight eversion. The suture is organized off to the left, out of the bite path. No penetration is captured before the cut to the next segment.

When the view resumes, the needle has already traversed both sides of the wound and the scene moves directly into knot tying at that lower‑central site. The operator switches roles so the left hand runs the needle driver as a tying tool while the right hand controls the long limb. The needle itself is parked safely to the right. The long limb is wrapped over the driver; the driver’s jaws then seize the short end and pull it through to complete a throw. The wraps alternate direction, producing square throws that are cinched horizontally to seat the knot directly over the wound. Throughout, the hands keep the loops elevated for control, then lay the knot down with smooth, even tension. A second ring‑handled instrument briefly assists and then is withdrawn as the knot is finalized. The rhythm here is deliberate and consistent: wrap, grasp, pull through, then oppose tension to square and seat.

The tying continues in the next passage at the same region. The right hand manipulates the suture and presents the free end; the driver enters intermittently from the left to grasp and pass the tail, then is set down and reintroduced as needed. The needle remains attached but off to the right, away from the tying zone. Throws are added and advanced with the driver acting as a knot pusher, and each is tightened with parallel, skin‑level traction. No tissue bites are taken; approximation is achieved by suture tension alone. By the end of this sequence, the knot sits centered over the slit with the edges gently apposed.

The field then resets. For several moments no hands are visible, and attention shifts toward the lower‑left vertical incision. The right hand reenters holding a needle driver and deliberately reloads the curved needle along its mid‑to‑proximal third. Orientation is refined so the needle sits perpendicular to the pad with its curve set for a right‑to‑left pass. A second long instrument is parked on the left to stabilize the suture and help with exposure. The right hand briefly uses forceps to fine‑tune the grip on the needle, then returns to the driver. No penetration is made in this window; this is careful preparation for the next stitch.

Instead of driving the needle, the next segment shows the stitch at the inferior‑left incision being tied down. Initially the field is empty, then the right hand slides in to tension the long end laterally while the left hand brings in the needle driver. The needle remains attached to the short end but is “parked” near the left wound edge and not driven. The driver serves as the post; the right hand wraps the long strand around it, and the driver grasps and pulls the short end through the loop to complete successive throws. Briefly, gauze touches down at the lower edge to clear or manage the suture. The knot is seated on the left side of the incision with controlled, horizontal traction, and the edges approximate without forceps on the skin.

The same controlled instrument‑tie technique continues over the next moments at the lower‑left laceration. The right hand now wields the needle driver to grab and draw the long limb while the left hand, holding forceps, steadies the short tail and the previously laid knot. The driver functions as both a grasper and a knot pusher, advancing throws neatly onto the knot stack. The forceps stay stationary near the 9–11 o’clock position to prevent the knot from riding up as tension is applied rightward. No new bites are taken.

Moving slightly inferior and lateral, the left hand keeps a needle driver as the post while the right hand performs the wraps and passes the free limb to build additional throws at a small V‑shaped wound corner. The first and second throws are executed with reversed directions to square the knot. Both hands then pull in opposite directions, parallel to the skin, to seat the knot without crushing the edges. The standing limb remains left‑to‑right across the field; the free limb is managed from the right.

The operator then works along a left‑sided linear incision already showing prior stitches. The left hand holds a driver with the loaded needle parked above the field; the right hand initially manages the free suture with fingers, switches to Adson forceps to control the loop and tail during tying, and then to a needle driver to complete instrument ties. Throws are added and advanced, and the knot is seated diagonally across the wound, then centered with balanced traction. By the end of this run, three interrupted sutures are visible on the left incision with the newest knot secure; instruments withdraw briefly.

Attention returns to needle preparation for the next bite on the left‑central incision. With no new passes yet, the right hand carefully reorients the needle in the driver so the body is held at the mid‑proximal third and the tip is perpendicular to the entry site. The left hand’s tissue forceps provide gentle countertraction and slight elevation of the edge for exposure but do not grasp or crush the wound. The instruments converge over the planned entry point, then pause—this is precise setup rather than penetration.

The video then moves back to tying. The dominant (right) hand continues with the needle driver, and the nondominant hand enters to control the short end. A first throw is formed by rotating the driver, presenting the loop, and pulling the free limb through; the driver reverses and repeats to square the knot. The knot is advanced down directly over the incision, tightened with smooth, opposing, horizontal traction. No forceps are applied to the wound edges; approximation is maintained entirely by suture control. Throughout, the needle itself stays out of the tying zone, reducing the risk of inadvertent puncture.

This tying rhythm persists across the next sequence. The left hand’s needle holder “posts” the standing limb close to the wound while the right hand forms loops and performs hand ties, alternating direction to square each throw. The suture is kept elevated above the skin until the final tightening, then laid down centrally over the incision. The needle remains safely parked to the right, away from the working area.

In the final moments, a right hand briefly enters from the right to tension the suture near the most recent knot while a metallic instrument appears momentarily superior‑left to the suture line, maintaining a two‑sided approach. No needle is visible, no new bites are taken, and after this short adjustment the field becomes static. The leftmost incision is shown closed with several interrupted sutures and stable, slightly everted edges; other practice incisions remain open and untouched. No trimming of tails is shown.

Across the entire video, the procedure progresses in measured cycles: prepare and orient, park the needle safely, execute instrument or hand ties with alternating throws, seat the knot with even horizontal traction, and reset. Hand roles shift as needed—often the left hand runs the driver as the post while the right hand manages the long limb, but at times the right hand takes the driver to pull the long end and push throws down while the left stabilizes the tail with forceps. Needle handling emphasizes safety and economy: when not passing, the needle is kept out of the tying zone; when preparing to pass, it is grasped on the mid‑to‑proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the skin with the curve set to follow its arc. Tissue handling remains gentle throughout: no pinching or crushing of the edges, minimal eversion created only when needed for exposure, and approximation achieved by suture tension. The overall flow is calm and methodical, building secure, square knots over sequential interrupted stitches until the left incision lies closed and undisturbed at the end.
