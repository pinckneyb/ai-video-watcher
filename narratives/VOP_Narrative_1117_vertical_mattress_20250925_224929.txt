COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a focused closure of a single vertical training incision in the upper‑left quadrant of the practice skin pad. From the first frames to the final sequence the operator repeatedly returns to and works along that one linear slit, placing a series of simple interrupted sutures to approximate and everting the skin edges. The wound is short (roughly 1–3 cm depending on the frame descriptions), full‑thickness in the simulator material, and is closed in a stepwise, methodical fashion: each pass follows the same basic choreography of tissue presentation, needle placement, suture passage, tensioning, knot formation and trimming before the team advances to the next adjacent bite.

Initial approach and exposure
At the outset the incision is identified and stabilized. The non‑dominant hand consistently presents and manipulates the near wound edge with fine thumb forceps (Adson‑style) while the dominant hand holds a needle driver/needle holder. The forceps are used to lift, evert and gently tent the epidermal and dermal edges so that bites can be taken close to the margin. The instruments are kept very close to the wound (typically within a few centimeters of each other), converging above the incision in a precision pincer configuration; common approach angles described are approximately at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock relative to the wound. Throughout the procedure both hands remain gloved and coordinated; occasionally the roles switch so that either hand may act as the needle‑holding hand depending on orientation and the particular bite being taken, but the standard relationship—one instrument stabilizing, the other advancing the needle—remains constant.

Needle handling and bite mechanics
The operator uses a curved, swaged surgical needle almost exclusively. Grip location varies slightly between passes (midshaft, roughly one‑third to one‑half from the swage, or proximal third), but the technique is consistent: the needle driver grasps the needle at a point that allows a controlled, short arc through the simulator dermis. The driver often approaches approximately perpendicular to the skin surface for a controlled, shallow-to-mid dermal bite. The convex face of the needle is frequently oriented upward and the needle tip is directed toward the wound margin to complete the pass. Rotation of the wrist and short, controlled arcs rather than large sweeping motions are used to follow the needle curvature through tissue.

The near edge is elevated and slightly everted with forceps while the needle is driven across the opposite edge. Bites are taken close to the epidermal margin (small‑margin bites, often 2–3 mm from the edge), aiming for superficial to mid‑dermal purchase rather than deep bites. This yields controlled edge eversion when the suture is tensioned. In several frames the needle is seen entering from lateral to medial, or from a slight superior or inferior approach depending on the operator’s stance, but the practical effect is the same: the needle traverses one side, exits near the midline of the wound, and is then passed through the opposite edge.

Sequential stitch placement and spatial progression
From the earliest sequences forward, multiple completed interrupted stitches are visible inferior to the working site, demonstrating the sequential nature of the closure. The operator progresses along the single vertical incision adding additional interrupted stitches adjacent to the previously tied knots. In many of the later frames the active work is at the superiormost unclosed gap of the same line: the operator repeatedly repositions to the superior end and places the next stitch there, then moves slightly inferior or medial as necessary to complete the bite and prepare for knotting. This establishes a continuous row of evenly spaced interrupted sutures along the incision with each new stitch placed immediately adjacent to earlier ones.

Hand positions remain tightly coordinated during this progression. The needle driver routinely operates from the lateral/superior quadrant relative to the bite while the forceps present the tissue from the medial/inferior side. The distance between instrument tips stays small throughout—typically on the order of 1–4 cm—to maintain close control of needle trajectory and tissue apposition. When tying is required the two instruments come together over the wound to pull and tension the suture loop; scissors or a hemostat occasionally appear near the dominant hand to trim suture tails after knot formation.

Knot formation and suture management
After passage of the needle through both wound edges the operator draws the suture through, manages the free tail with a second instrument as needed, and forms a knot. The knotting maneuvers are classic for interrupted closure: the loop is reduced, tension applied to approximate edges with slight eversion and to avoid puckering, and throws are arranged to secure the stitch. There are repeated references to preparing and tightening knots, and in several frames the surgeon trims excess suture, indicating completion of an individual interrupted closure before moving along the line. Suture tails are managed with clamps or forceps when needed, and the sequence shows alternation between passing new needles and finishing previously placed stitches with knotting and cutting.

Tissue response and technique fidelity
Across the sequence the simulated tissue responds predictably: bites produce slight eversion of wound margins and, in a few frames, minor puckering where bites are close together or tension is higher. The operator consistently aims for slight eversion—appropriate for epidermal approximation—and avoids deep tissue grabbing. The majority of passes are superficial to mid‑dermal; no deep fascial suturing is evident. Occasionally small gaps remain between some bites, particularly in early to mid sequences where the operator fine‑tunes spacing, but later frames show tighter apposition after successive stitches are placed and tensioned. Overall, the technique is performed with controlled, deliberate needle control, frequent regrasping at mid‑arc for precision, and cautious tensioning to minimize tissue distortion.

Evolving hand positions and ergonomic adjustments
Although the two‑handed coordination pattern is constant, the precise orientation of hands relative to the wound evolves subtly over time to address different sections of the incision and to account for the operator’s ergonomic needs. At times the dominant needle driver approaches from the viewer’s left, and at other times from the right or superior side; the non‑dominant hand correspondingly shifts to maintain optimal presentation of the near edge. The operator keeps both hands close to the wound throughout the procedure, minimizing lever arms and improving fine control. When working at the superior portion of the incision the needle driver often approaches from a superior‑lateral vector while the forceps come from a medial/inferior direction; when placing more central or slightly inferior bites the approach angles rotate modestly but the pincer relationship persists. Instrument tips frequently cross over the incision during needle passage and knotting, reflecting the small working field and the necessity of transfer and tensioning.

Consistency of technique across the closure
From beginning to end the operator adheres to a consistent interrupted‑suture strategy—placing single, isolated stitches that are passed, tensioned, tied and trimmed before the next adjacent stitch is placed. The needle‑holding technique (gripping the needle near the body to allow controlled arcs), the tissue presentation (forceps lifting and everting the near edge), and the bite placement (small, epidermal/dermal bites close to the margin) remain the hallmark of the entire closure. There is no drift to a running or continuous technique; every pass is treated as an independent interrupted closure. Where minor deviations occur, they are practical adaptations (slightly varying grip point or approach angle) rather than a change in suture technique.

Repeated cycles: pass, draw, tie, trim
Each stitch follows a clear cycle: the needle is introduced with a controlled arc through one wound edge under guidance of the forceps; it exits, is repositioned as necessary, and is passed through the opposing edge. The suture is drawn through, the loop reduced, and the knot tied to approximate edges with subtle eversion. Scissors or a hemostat are then used to trim the tails. After one stitch is completed the operator repositions a short distance along the same slit to place the next stitch. This cyclical workflow is repeated many times across the single incision, building a continuous line of individual closures.

Late sequence and completion
In the latter portions of the recording the operator consistently works at the superior end of the line, placing and finishing the most proximal unclosed bite. The final frames show the needle being grasped in the needle driver at its tip or proximal body, oriented almost perpendicular to the skin, and driven through a short dermal bite; the suture is then drawn through, brought together with the other instrument for knotting, and tightened to yield a well‑approximated, slightly everted edge. The completed stitch is cut and the instruments are withdrawn from the site. By these final moments the incision is spanned by multiple evenly spaced interrupted sutures; knots lie external to the wound surface with modest eversion and generally good edge apposition.

Overall assessment of the closed wound
By the end of the sequence the linear slit in the upper‑left quadrant is consistently approximated along its length with serial simple interrupted sutures. The operative technique throughout is methodical and consistent: curved needles are used with needle drivers grasping near mid‑arc or proximal thirds for control, forceps present and evert the near edge, and stitches are placed at small margins to achieve epidermal alignment and slight eversion. Instrument tips remain convergent and close to the wound throughout, facilitating precise needle control, suture management and knot tying. Small variations in bite depth, minor tissue puckering in places, and occasional gaps between bites early on reflect the iterative nature of the work, but the completed repair demonstrates appropriate approximation and secure interrupted closures along the single treated incision.

In summary, the operator closes one vertical incision on the upper‑left area of the pad by placing a series of simple interrupted sutures. The procedure is characterized by tight bimanual coordination—forceps to present and evert, needle driver to deliver controlled curved‑needle bites—followed by knot formation and trimming. The stitches are added sequentially along the same line until the incision is fully approximated with multiple interrupted closures exhibiting slight eversion and generally good apposition.
