Preparation and field orientation
The work in this procedure concentrates on the vertical incision just right of the pad’s midline. Two other slits are visible on the pad but are not part of this closure. From the outset and through to the final frames, the operator treats this right‑of‑center wound with a continuous (running) technique, building a line of evenly spaced bites from the lower portion toward the superior end. The hands and instruments consistently organize around this one incision: a needle driver controls the curved needle at about the proximal third to mid‑body, kept perpendicular to the skin surface; the contralateral hand alternates between tissue forceps to evert and stabilize the near edge and, later, a second driver/scissors or hemostat to manage the standing and free limbs during tying and tensioning. When not used, instruments are set down peripheral to the pad.

Establishing the run at the lower end
Early in the sequence over this right‑of‑center wound, the operator establishes the running line at the inferior portion by taking the first pass across the gap. The needle driver holds the needle perpendicular to the pad; the opposite hand steadies the near edge with pickups and manages the emerging suture loop as the needle arcs smoothly through the right edge toward the left. At this starting stage, there are no completed crossings on this wound; one pass is being laid down to initiate the line. The suture is drawn across and laid out to the right as the operator positions for securing the start.

Anchor and early progression
After the first passage, the operator secures the run’s anchor. With the needle still on the strand, the driver is used mainly for instrument ties while the other hand manages the tensioned limb. Two completed crossings become apparent at this stage, with a third throw being formed and seated as an anchor. This is consistent with how a continuous closure begins: an initial throw or pair of throws is tied at the starting end to fix the line before proceeding with the running sequence.

Needle loading is deliberate: the driver grips the needle at its proximal third, keeping the curve perpendicular to the wound so that each bite enters and exits at mirrored depths. The forceps, when used, grasp the epidermal fringe lightly to evert the dermal edges, setting up symmetric bites. With the anchor in place, the wound edges at the lower segment are apposed, and the free strand trails proximally along the incision line.

Advancing along the incision: placement and tensioning rhythm
With the anchor secured, the operator advances up the incision in a steady rhythm. The hands oppose each other across the wound: the needle driver crosses the incision to place each bite while the forceps evert and present the near edge. The driver follows a smooth, curvilinear arc; each pass traverses from one edge to the other at a depth corresponding to the prior bites, maintaining spacing and alignment. The non‑driving hand controls the suture loop to prevent slack and to avoid sawing at the tissue.

As the line develops, three completed crossings are visible. The next sequence shows a more mature line: five crossings already in place, and a sixth pass being added. The technique remains consistent—driver perpendicular, forceps assisting eversion, then the suture is drawn through and the loop is snugged. Short, controlled movements keep the instruments parallel to the incision to prevent crowding the wound. The driver often regrips the needle after a pass to pull through smoothly without deforming the loop.

Managing slack and setting the running line
At points in the procedure, the operator pauses to manage slack and set the entire running segment. The left hand may hold the driver above the wound as a guide while the right hand pulls the standing limb proximally and slightly laterally, tensioning the previously placed bites in sequence. In some of these tightening phases, forceps are not used; instead, controlled traction on the line alone coapts the edges and produces mild eversion across multiple loops at once. This “tension‑then‑set” cadence is revisited several times as the line lengthens: a few bites are placed, then the previously laid loops are seated down the wound axis so the edges meet evenly without dog‑ears or gaps.

During one such tensioning pause near the mid‑portion, approximately four completed crossings are visible. Soon after, with repositioning, seven crossings can be seen along the same wound as the operator organizes the strand for the next throw. Variations in the number visible from one snippet to another reflect field‑of‑view differences during setup and tightening; however, the pattern is a steady cranial progression with the count increasing over time.

Upper‑segment placement and refinement
As the work moves into the upper third of the incision, the operator returns to precise bite placement. The driver is centered just above the intended entry point at the right edge, with the forceps on the right side lifting and everting the near margin to expose the dermal bite site. The needle is driven in a controlled curve across to the opposite edge. The suture is then drawn through and tensioned, with the long strand arcing gently across the field. The hands remain close and parallel to the incision, alternating crossing just over the wound to square the loops as they are set.

At this stage, six completed crossings are visible along the right‑of‑center incision. Subsequent tightening passes slightly lift and set the existing loops; while counts momentarily appear lower in some stills depending on framing, the line continues to advance toward the superior end.

Finishing the run: locking and tie‑off at the superior end
When the running line reaches the top, the operator transitions from placement to finish. The needle is parked just above the superior end while instrument ties are formed to lock the run. The working hand with the needle driver forms loops around the standing limb; the opposite hand holds the free limb and assists with squaring the throws. A hemostat or second driver briefly appears to manage slack as the knot is seated flush at the superior apex. Throughout, the instruments remain aligned along the incision axis, tips meeting directly above the wound to keep the knot centralized.

With the lock secured, the operator performs a final tensioning sweep along the run: the right hand pulls along the axis, then laterally, to remove any residual slack and set each crossing evenly. In one sequence of these finishing actions, seven crossings are visible along the line; in another, eight are seen as the loops are temporarily spread during tensioning before they settle. The driver is then set down, and the wound is left undisturbed for a final still.

Hand positions and instrument choreography across the case
- Early placement: The needle driver works from above/central over the right‑of‑center incision; the assisting hand with forceps is just lateral to the right edge. Hands oppose each other across the wound, with the driver crossing the midline to guide the needle through.
- Running advance: The driver maintains a near‑perpendicular needle orientation; the forceps gently evert the near edge for symmetric bites. The assisting hand also manages the loop to prevent slack and tangles.
- Tensioning phases: At intervals, the non‑driving hand releases forceps and simply tensions the standing limb, pulling proximally and then laterally to set multiple prior loops. The driver may hover over the wound as a guide during these maneuvers.
- Finishing: Both hands employ drivers/hemostat to form and square the final locking throws at the superior end, with scissors used briefly only to manage or trim if needed. The instruments are held parallel to the incision, meeting directly over the wound to center the finishing knot.

Technique consistency and brief deviations
Across the entire closure on this wound, the method is a true running technique:
- The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body and presented perpendicular to the skin for controlled, symmetric bites.
- Forceps use is precise and light, aimed at eversion and stabilization rather than heavy traction.
- A regular cadence is maintained: place a pass, draw through, tension; after several passes, globally tighten the segment to coapt edges, then continue.
- The run is locked and tied at the superior end using instrument ties with the knot seated squarely over the wound axis.

Minor observational fluctuations—such as counts that temporarily appear lower or higher in isolated frames—reflect camera framing and transient loop spreading during tensioning rather than changes in the underlying technique. The occasional absence of forceps during global tightening is a deliberate choice to set prior loops, not a change in suturing pattern.

Quantitative progression of stitch count
Although the number of crossings visible in individual snippets varies with framing and whether loops are being actively tightened, the overall count on this same right‑of‑center running line increases steadily as the closure advances cranially. The progression that can be explicitly tracked from the frames is:
- Start of the line at the lower end: 0 completed crossings visible as the first bite is placed.
- Early anchoring: approximately 2 completed crossings are visible with an additional throw being tied to secure the start.
- Early advance: 3 completed crossings visible after initial progression.
- Midcourse addition: a series of placements brings the visible count up to 5, then a sixth crossing is added.
- Post‑tensioning view: counts vary with framing (e.g., 4 seen during a slack‑pulling sequence, then 7 visible after re‑exposure of the full segment).
- Near completion: 6–7 crossings are present as the operator places/tensions the uppermost bites and prepares the lock.
- Finishing and final set: during final tensioning, up to 8 crossings can be seen momentarily as loops are spread, but once the line settles in the last stills, the stable count is seven.

Final state and mandatory suture count verification
- Final visual count: In the last frames of the sequence, the right‑of‑center running closure shows 7 completed stitch crossings along the incision.
- Explicit statement of result: The procedure resulted in 7 completed sutures (crossings) along the continuous line.
- Final appearance: The wound edges are coapted along the full length of the right‑of‑center incision with a neat, continuous series of evenly spaced loops. The finishing knot at the superior end is seated centrally, and no additional manipulation is occurring; instruments rest off the field.

Summary narrative
The operator closes a single, straight vertical incision just right of midline using a continuous running technique. After the first pass is taken and the start is anchored at the inferior end, the line is advanced in a steady, symmetrical pattern: the needle is consistently loaded at the proximal third, presented perpendicular to the skin; the assisting hand with pickups gently everts the near edge to create mirror‑image bites; and the suture is drawn through without undue tension. Every few passes, the operator pauses to tighten and “set” the previously placed loops by pulling the standing limb along and across the line, bringing the epidermal margins neatly together. This cadence—place several bites, then globally tighten—continues as the closure progresses into the upper third. At the top, the run is locked and tied with instrument ties, the knot centered over the wound axis. After a final sweep to remove residual slack and seat each crossing, the line is left with seven completed stitch crossings visible in the final stills. The spatial choreography is disciplined throughout: instruments oppose each other across the wound, remain parallel to the incision to avoid crowding, and cross briefly only to form and square knots or to guide the needle’s arc. The result is a neatly apposed continuous closure with a final, verified count of 7 completed sutures.
