COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a deliberate, methodical closure of a single linear/curvilinear skin incision located on the left side of the practice pad, predominantly in the lower‑left to left‑central quadrant. From the first frames to the last, the operator progresses along the same incision, sequentially placing and securing simple interrupted sutures to approximate the epidermal edges and restore anatomical continuity. The work alternates between passing new penetrating bites and tying down previously passed stitches; assistant instruments or a second hand provide consistent counter‑traction and suture control. Throughout, a curved, swaged needle is repeatedly used and the operator relies on a combination of needle driver and fine forceps to control needle trajectory, tissue apposition, knot advancement, and suture trimming.

Initial approach and first passes
At the start the surgeon positions hands straddling the incision, with a needle driver in the dominant hand and a pickup/forceps in the opposite hand. The needle is consistently grasped relatively proximally — commonly near the mid‑shaft or slightly toward the body–tip junction — so the operator can control the arc of the curve and rotate the shaft through a standard tissue bite. Entry orientation is usually perpendicular or slightly oblique to the skin surface, with the tip driven from lateral toward medial or from the far edge toward the near edge, depending on the local segment of the incision being addressed. The opposite hand lifts and stabilizes the near wound edge with toothed forceps or a hemostat, providing a small amount of eversion as the needle engages dermal tissue. Passes are performed deliberately, with the needle rotated through its arc and the suture drawn through until adequate suture tail is available for tying.

Progression along the incision
After initial bites near the central segment, the operator advances sequentially along the same incision. At times the team works more medially, at other times more laterally, but the pattern is consistent: after passing a needle and pulling suture through, the operator or assistant prepares for knotting while the other instrument maintains approximation. Where the incision is curvilinear or V‑shaped, the operator adapts needle orientation and hand approach so the needle path follows the local curvature, yet the same interrupted technique is applied. Multiple adjacent interrupted stitches are visible at different phases — some are fully tied with tails being trimmed, others are mid‑pass or being tensioned — demonstrating stepwise progression from one bite to the next along the same wound line.

Needle handling and grip strategy
Needle control is a central feature of the closure. The needle driver repeatedly grips the curved needle near mid‑shaft or slightly more proximate when needing additional control for tight turns. This allows a controlled tip‑first arc through the dermal simulator. Occasionally the grip is adjusted between passes — sometimes closer to the hub for knot manipulation and trimming, sometimes a bit more distal during passage — reflecting an appropriate modulation of grip to match the task. The needle tip is guided under direct vision with the non‑dominant forceps either lifting the tissue, opening the bite site, or receiving the needle point as it exits. In some frames the operator uses the non‑dominant instrument to back up the near edge so the passing needle has a defined purchase and the edges evert slightly on approximation.

Tissue handling and edge apposition
Across the sequence the simulated dermis is engaged at superficial, epidermal‑dermal depth only; there is no evidence of deep fascial or subcutaneous layer engagement. The operator consistently aims for everted, well‑aligned skin margins: the forceps lift the near edge and the needle pass through the opposing edge is taken so that when tension is applied the epidermal borders meet with a subtle eversion. Traction on the suture is applied gently to avoid tissue bunching. Where the incision curves or changes orientation (including a short transverse notch and an inverted V shape encountered during the sequence), the operator adjusts bite angle and vector of traction to maintain consistent edge approximation.

Hand and instrument choreography
Hand positions evolve predictably as the closure advances along the wound. Early frames show the dominant right hand driving the needle from the lateral or superior aspect of the incision while the left hand receives and stabilizes the tissue medially/inferiorly. In several segments, especially during knotting and trimming, the roles interchange slightly: the left instrument sometimes assumes needle control to complete a pass or to pass the needle to the right hand for tie‑down. Throughout, instrument tips remain within a tight working envelope — frequently only a few centimeters apart — and cross over one another momentarily during needle exchange and suture pull‑through.

When an assistant is present, that instrument provides sustained counter‑traction and suture management: holding suture tails under a hemostat, clamping a previously tied knot, or presenting the tissue for the next bite. In solo segments the operator alternates instruments between hands with quick, efficient exchanges so advancement along the incision proceeds without unnecessary delay. The right hand predominantly performs needle driving and knot advancement; the left hand mostly stabilizes tissue and manages suture tails.

Knotting and suture management
Following passage of each bite, the operator secures the stitch using standard simple interrupted knot techniques. Knot advancement is often performed with a needle driver or hemostat used to tighten the throws; the non‑dominant instrument maintains the opposing limb for control. In places the sequence shows trimming of suture tails with scissors, and occasional repositioning of clamps along tails while subsequent stitches are placed. Knot security is achieved while preserving mild eversion and avoiding over‑tightening — tension is modulated so the skin edges are approximated without puckering.

Adaptation to wound geometry
Different portions of the same incision present varied geometry: segments described include short transverse areas, a small inverted V defect, oblique linear stretches, and curved crescents. The operator adapts needle orientation and hand approach accordingly. For example, at the inverted V the needle is angled more downward and the non‑dominant instrument approaches from a lower lateral vector to facilitate a perpendicular bite at the apex. On linear segments the needle path is more perpendicular and the hands approach in opposition across the wound axis. Despite these adjustments, the underlying technique — mid‑shaft needle grasp, tip‑first passage, elevation of the near edge, suture pull‑through, knot tying with maintained eversion — remains consistent.

Technique consistency and refinement
Although the basic approach is consistent throughout, the surgeon exhibits small refinements over time: quicker, more economical repositioning of the needle driver between passes; more precise grip placement closer to the body–point junction when negotiating tight curves; and smoother hand exchanges during needle retrieval. The consistency is notable in the regular use of superficial dermal bites and an emphasis on eversion. Minor variation in grip location and which hand controls the needle in a given frame reflect real‑time adaptation to local tissue orientation rather than a change in overall technique.

Spatial relationships during the run
Instruments maintain a reciprocal relationship: needle driver on one side, forceps on the other, converging at the bite site. Hands stay close — often within 1–5 cm — to facilitate rapid, coordinated action. Where the working area is more confined (for instance the V‑shaped defect), the instruments cross more tightly and the operator briefly repositions hands to maintain clear visualization of the tip. In larger linear stretches the instrument tips are slightly farther apart but still coordinate closely, with the left hand providing counter‑traction a few centimeters from the driver to permit controlled needle arcs.

Addressing knot tying versus new passes
Several periods in the sequence concentrate on knot management for already‑placed stitches: tightening sequential throws, clamping suture limbs, clipping tails, and shifting attention back to the next unclosed segment. Other intervals show pure needle passage and pull‑through before any knot tying occurs. This alternating rhythm — pass, secure, trim, move to next location — defines the overall workflow and keeps the width of closure uniform along the incision.

Final inspection and closure state
By the later frames attention shifts toward final knot security and trimming. Knot tails are shortened and instrument withdrawal is deliberate, confirming each stitch is tensioned to create close, everted skin apposition without evidence of gapping or excess tissue bunching. The entire incision is progressively closed from one end toward the other, leaving an even line of interrupted sutures that restore contour and alignment. The final visual state shows neatly approximated epidermal edges across the length of the incision, slight eversion consistent with proper superficial closure, and trimmed suture tails — an orderly, securely approximated closure appropriate for the simulated dermal model.

Summary assessment
Throughout the case the team uses a reproducible, simple interrupted suturing technique with predictable needle grips and controlled tissue handling. Needle control is achieved via mid‑shaft to near‑hub grips on a curved swaged needle, with the non‑dominant forceps providing lift, eversion, and counter‑traction. The operator adapts hand positions and needle orientation to match local wound geometry, yet the core method — take a perpendicular to slightly oblique dermal bite, elevate the opposing edge, draw the suture through, tie secure interrupted knots with mild eversion, and trim tails — remains constant. The coordinated choreography of hands and instruments results in a continuous, properly aligned closure of the entire incision line from initial pass to final knot and tail trimming.
