COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
At the start of the recording the operator focuses attention on the vertical slit located slightly left of center on the practice pad — the second incision from the left in the array of template cuts. From the opening frames the strategy is clear: a methodical closure of that single linear wound by sequential placement of short, interrupted dermal bites using a curved suture needle and precise instrument control. The working field is compact; both gloved hands remain close to the incision throughout, typically within a few centimeters of the wound margin, and the needle driver and fine tissue forceps operate in tight coordination to control needle trajectory, tissue apposition, suture loops and knot formation.

Early passes (0–60 seconds)
During the initial passes the needle driver approaches from above and slightly medial to the wound while fine toothed forceps approach from the lateral/inferior side. The needle is almost always grasped at its mid‑to‑proximal shaft, not at the swage or extreme tip, which gives the operator a controlled arc when presenting the curved needle into the dermal plane. Bite depth is deliberately shallow-to-moderate and placed very close to the wound margin, emphasizing epidermal/dermal coaptation rather than deep bulky purchase. The forceps lift and evert the near edge while the driver advances the needle through the opposite edge; the two instruments converge over the same narrow working zone so that the needle point can be captured and drawn through with minimal tissue drag.

A new suture is introduced and pulled through, forming a loop that is then positioned for instrument tying. The operator intermittently secures the free tail with a hemostat or temporarily holds it with forceps as the next maneuver is prepared. Early movement patterns emphasize careful presentation of the needle in small arcs, rotation of the driver to seat the needle tip, and prompt retrieval with fine forceps. Throughout these early frames the incision margins are approximated with slight eversion as each stitch is seated.

Filling the defect and refining bites (60–180 seconds)
As the procedure proceeds the operator fills the length of the slit by placing additional interrupted bites adjacent to previously seated sutures. The left-sided instrument (as seen in most views) continues to act as the primary needle‑controlling hand, often approaching from the superior/left quadrant of the frame, while the contralateral hand stabilizes tissue and manipulates suture tails. Each needle pass is deliberate: the driver presents the curved needle perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin plane, the forceps elevate the far edge and guide the point’s exit, and the operator withdraws the needle and advances the suture loop into position for knot-tying.

There is a consistent focus on placing bites close to prior entry points so that the line of interruptions is closely spaced and produces an even, coapted edge. The operator repeatedly repositions the needle grip at the shaft to refine control when a tighter or more oblique pass is required. Occasional regrasping or repositioning of the driver is seen before an insertion, consistent with controlling needle arc and preventing a tip-first plunge.

A brief anomaly appears in the mid-sequence: a set of frames shows a small stellate/triangular defect between the template slits with a prior stitch visible at that focal point. While this differs in description from the linear slit, the activity in those frames reflects the same suturing approach — needle presentation from above, forceps approximating edges and preparation of throws — and appears to be a local irregularity of the practice pad rather than a change in overall plan. Notably, the operator treats this focal defect with the same interrupted‑stitch technique rather than switching to a different closure style.

Knot formation, instrument ties and loop management (150–300 seconds)
After each new bite is passed, attention shifts to knot-tying and suture handling. The needle driver frequently assumes a temporary role holding the suture near the wound to form instrument ties; the forceps grasp the opposite limb to create throws, cinch knots down, and arrange tails. Instrument ties predominate: the needle driver and forceps alternate roles — one forming and tightening a throw while the other controls the opposing suture limb — and the operator uses short, controlled motions to produce compact knot stacks that lie close to the tissue. At times a hemostat is used to secure a tail while the knot is completed.

Knot-tying frames show slight eversion of the wound edges as the throws are tightened — a deliberate technique choice to ensure epidermal approximation when the mattress of the dermis shrinks under tension. The operator takes care to avoid excessive traction on surrounding tissue; gestures are precise and confined to the immediate wound area. Following knots, occasional trimming is suggested by a scissors-like instrument resting within reach; in several frames the operator rearranges or trims tails, although not every knot is visibly trimmed in every frame.

Progression along the wound (300–375 seconds)
The pattern of placement continues superior-to-inferior (and occasionally inferior-to-superior, depending on camera framing) along the length of the slit. New bites are placed adjacent to existing stitches to close residual gaps; the operator systematically fills any interstices between prior interrupted sutures. The needle is consistently grasped near the shaft for control, and the driver is repositioned frequently to maintain the correct angle of approach as the line of closure develops. The forceps maintain steady assistance, either by elevating edges for next passes or by managing loops and tails during knot sequences.

Throughout, spatial relationships remain compact: instruments converge above the incision at distances typically between 1 and 4 cm, with tips meeting closely to control needle passage and loop formation. Instrument crossing is minimal and brief; the hands usually operate in parallel planes with the driver superior/medial and the forceps inferior/lateral. Manipulation is superficial and delicate, consistent with synthetic dermal layers that require minimal bulk overtension.

Refining, tightening and final throws (375–420 seconds)
As more interrupted sutures are placed, the operator shifts emphasis toward tightening and finalizing knots, trimming tails, and ensuring uniform apposition along the entire line. Knot stacks become more frequent and the suture tails are shepherded laterally as the operator finishes each throw. The left/right hand roles remain largely stable, though in a few views the perspective or momentary swapping of instruments gives the appearance of a change in dominance; overall, the principal pattern is maintained: a needle-controlling driver presenting and rotating the curved needle, and a pair of fine forceps stabilizing tissue and managing suture limbs.

By the late frames the wound is populated by short, closely spaced interrupted stitches. Slight residual loops and loose tails are visible in a few frames, and the operator dedicates time to lay knots flat and tuck tails to reduce snagging. One brief set of frames shows the hands mostly out of view while the line remains intact — this offers an unobstructed perspective of the closure: a uniform series of interrupted sutures approximating the epidermal edges with gentle eversion and consistent spacing.

Final inspection and overall closure quality (final frames)
The concluding frames depict a fully reconstructed slit with multiple short simple interrupted stitches that span its length. Wound edges are well coapted with slight eversion at each knot site; the series of sutures lies closely spaced to maintain alignment and prevent step-off. Several frames show the operator making minor adjustments to knots and suture tails and, in at least one instance, a hand briefly enters without instruments — consistent with a final tactile inspection. There are no signs of gross tissue distortion, and because this is a training model there is no bleeding; manipulation is focused on precise approximation and tidy knot stacks.

Technique consistency and evolution
Across the entire video the technique retains remarkable consistency: curved needle passes near the wound margin, mid‑shaft needle grasp in the driver, forceps-assisted elevation and eversion of wound edges, and formation of instrument-tied interrupted sutures. The operator’s motions become progressively more fluent: early frames show careful repositioning and regrasping of the needle; later frames demonstrate brisker, more economical passes and more compact knot stacks. This reflects standard incremental skill refinement within the single session rather than a shift in closure style. No transition to running sutures, subcuticular closure, or buried knots is observed; the operator remains committed to sequential interrupted closures, completing each pass with instrument ties and tail management before proceeding to the next adjacent bite.

Hand position and spatial coordination
From the first to the last frame the two hands remain tightly coordinated and confined to the same narrow surgical corridor over the wound. The dominant instrument (the needle driver) generally approaches from above/left of the incision, rotating and presenting the curved needle in controlled arcs. The assisting instrument (fine toothed forceps) consistently stabilizes, approximates, and everts the edges while also manipulating suture tails during knot formation. At no point do the hands stray to distant quadrants of the field; instead, movements are compact, alternating between needle presentation, capture and loop/tail management. The interplay is classic instrument-tying choreography: the driver forms and advances throws while the forceps provide counter‑traction and limb control.

Noted inconsistencies and model artifacts
The recordings include one notable variation — a depiction of a small stellate defect adjacent to the main slit that receives the same interrupted-stitch approach. This appears to be an isolated practice-pad irregularity rather than a strategy change. Additionally, in a few frames the camera perspective or momentary swapping of operator hands gives the impression that the needle driver hand changes laterality; however, the prevailing pattern of a superior/medial driver and an inferior/lateral forceps is maintained throughout. Because this is a synthetic model, the absence of bleeding and tissue turgor limits certain clinical cues, but it does allow for clean visualization of technique and knot stacks.

Final state summary
By the end of the procedure the vertical incision is closed along its length with a series of closely spaced simple interrupted sutures. Each stitch approximates the dermal/epidermal edges with slight eversion; knot stacks are compact and lie near the wound surface with tails managed to minimize loose loops. The sequence of needle passes, suture advancement, instrument‑tied throws and trimming/arrangement of tails is repeated uniformly along the wound until a continuous line of well‑approximated interruptions is achieved. Hands withdraw periodically to inspect and adjust, and the final visual frames show a clean, secure closure appropriate for this practice model.
