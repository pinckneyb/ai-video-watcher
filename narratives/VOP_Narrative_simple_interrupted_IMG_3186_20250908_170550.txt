COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The scene opens on a three‑incision suture pad: a central vertical wound already bridged by a row of simple interrupted stitches, a separate vertical wound to the right that also bears interrupted sutures along its length, and a long, straight slit far to the left that is still gaping and largely untouched. Instruments and hands enter and leave the field in a way that makes it clear which line is being actively managed and which are being used for housekeeping or demonstration. The technique throughout is simple interrupted suturing with careful attention to perpendicular needle entry, small dermal bites, and purposeful edge eversion with Adson‑type forceps.

Initial preparation and instrument set‑up occur over the leftmost slit. Forceps in the right hand repeatedly lift and evert the lower corner of this left wound while the left hand alternates between tools—scalpel or small scissors to freshen the corner and then a needle driver as a needle is brought onto the field. The curved needle is controlled precisely: grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, oriented so its arc will meet the skin perpendicularly at the lower end of this left slit. This is a preparatory interlude to ready the instruments and suture; no knot is tied here yet and neither the central nor the right column is manipulated during these initial moments.

Attention then shifts to the vertical wound on the right half of the pad. This column already carries multiple simple interrupted sutures. The left hand intermittently controls the needle driver from above‑left of the wound while the right hand uses forceps along the right edge of the incision. The needle is reloaded repeatedly in the driver—held at roughly the proximal third or mid‑body—so that its concavity will face left and the tip will enter the near right edge square to the skin surface at the inferior end of the wound. These early passes are all about alignment: the driver is presented over the lower portion of the right incision, the needle set for a right‑to‑left pass, but tissue is not penetrated in these sequences. In one early look down this line, five completed interrupted stitches are visible spaced along the right wound; in later views of the same line, four completed stitches are visible. The working pattern and hand choreography are consistent: driver superior‑left and forceps at or just medial to the right wound edge, converging at the lower third where the next stitch is being set up.

A brief housekeeping sequence follows on the central wound. The right hand uses forceps to stabilize the inferior edge of the central incision and elevate a suture tail, while the left hand approaches with scissors to trim close to the knot. There is no needle in play here. The action consists of tidying and finishing an already placed stitch at the bottom of the central line. Throughout these central frames, four completed simple interrupted sutures are visible and remain unchanged; the wound edges are well approximated, and the trimming is done without disturbing eversion.

Next, the far‑left slit becomes a practice field. Across a series of sequences, the right hand with Adson forceps lifts and everts the top edges of this left wound to present the dermis. The left hand brings in the needle driver holding the curved needle about two‑thirds from its tip (occasionally nearer the swage when a deeper purchase is desired), always keeping the needle’s curve perpendicular to the skin surface. Bites are placed into the near (left) edge first, with the driver following the arc through the dermis in a controlled rotation. In these passes the far/right edge is approached afterward, sometimes regrasping the needle to complete the curve. Initially, these are single‑edge penetrations to start the first stitch at the top of the slit; no knots are tied in the earliest frames.

Technique is meticulous on the left slit: the forceps pick up a minimal amount of epidermis and underlying dermis to evert the margin. The needle tip is positioned just off the wound edge and driven through in a smooth arc. Hands oppose each other in classic fashion, the driver lateral to the line and the forceps medial, meeting precisely over the apex to ensure a perpendicular bite and avoid crushing the edge. The far edge remains unengaged in the earliest passes, which are clearly preparatory bites to get the suture through the near side and retrieve the needle safely.

A few moments later, the first simple interrupted stitch at the superior end of the left slit is actually completed. The needle is driven through the far side, the suture retrieved, and knot tying is performed with the needle driver and forceps crossing above the wound. The knot cinches down centered at the top of the left wound with appropriate, modest edge eversion. By the end of this tying sequence, one completed stitch is visible at the superior end of the left slit. This left‑side stitch is a discrete demonstration placement; beyond this, the closure of the left slit is not carried forward to completion within the captured footage.

Subsequent snippets over the left slit show further needle placements being initiated at the upper end again: forceps lifting the near edge, the driver orienting the needle to take another small dermal bite at the corner. These repeats show consistent technique—perpendicular entry, short bite depth, careful control of tissue with Adsons—but they stop short of tying additional knots. The driver often approaches slightly inferior‑lateral to the bite point while the forceps are superior‑medial; tissue is stabilized and everted for precise entry. During one of these sequences, the driver advances a new bite near the lower third of the slit as well—again with perpendicular orientation and edge eversion—retrieving the needle and suture without proceeding to completion. Throughout these left‑slit demonstrations, the central and right columns remain untouched.

The work then returns to the right‑hand vertical wound. This right column already shows evenly spaced interrupted sutures; their knots have short tails. The right hand, now close to the mid‑to‑lower portion of this wound, uses forceps to tug on suture tails along the line, briefly tightening or tidying them and causing small localized puckers in the synthetic skin around each knot without changing approximation. The left hand hovers with a needle driver or scissors above the pad at times, but there is no needle passage across tissue captured during these frames. After this tightening/tidying, the curved needle is reloaded in the driver at its proximal third, perpendicular to the skin, and presented over the inferior end of the right wound. The right edge is lifted, the opposite side stabilized, and the instruments converge over the lower third to set up the next interrupted stitch at the very bottom. In this view, three completed sutures are visible on the right‑hand incision as preparation begins for the next bite; in other views just prior and again later, four are seen along the line. Despite the setup, no knot is tied at this stage and no suture is definitively added to the right column within the captured sequence.

One more brief interlude returns to the left slit: forceps on the right side of that wound evert the left edge while the driver on the left advances the curved needle near the superior aspect. The needle passes across and the thread is drawn through, positioning for tying, but the frames end without cinching a knot. The hands work in opposition over the upper third of the left slit, mirrored choreography to the earlier demonstrations.

The procedure concludes back on the right‑hand column. A single hand—the one holding the needle driver—appears at the upper right of the frame, above the board, controlling the curved needle near its mid‑body. The needle tip is aimed downward toward the field, poised to approach the right‑sided wound. No opposing hand or forceps are on tissue in this moment; there is clear working space over the incision. Along the length of this right column, four completed simple interrupted sutures are visible. They are evenly spaced, their knots sitting neatly with tails untrimmed or only minimally trimmed, and the wound edges are approximated with a pleasing, slight eversion. The other two incisions—the left open slit and the middle incision with prior stitches—are out of focus behaviorally in this closing view and are not being addressed. The posture of the needle driver suggests the very next act would be to place another stitch at the lower end, but that action is not captured before the segment ends.

Technique and hand position across the captured work are consistent and deliberate:

- Instrument handling: The needle driver is the dominant working instrument, almost always in the left hand when the operator is preparing to place a bite on either line. The curved needle is grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body, giving optimal control of the arc and leverage for a perpendicular approach. Adson‑type forceps in the right hand are used to grasp only the dermal edge, lifting and everting without crushing, especially at corners and near the top and bottom of each wound.

- Needle orientation: The needle is consistently presented perpendicular to the skin surface to promote symmetrical dermal bites and even eversion. The wrist follows the needle’s curvature in a smooth rotation, and when necessary the needle is regrasped on its body to complete passage through the far side.

- Tissue interaction: On the right column, when tidying, the forceps grasp suture tails and apply gentle traction, leading to transient skin puckering but maintaining overall approximation. When setting up for a new stitch at the inferior end, the right wound edge is lifted slightly; the opposite edge is stabilized to align for a neat, perpendicular entry. On the left slit during demonstrations, the forceps pick up minimal epidermis, the edges are tented, and the bites are short, true to simple interrupted best practice.

- Hand choreography: Hands oppose each other across the wound at the moment of entry, converging just over the intended bite for control and visibility. The needle driver consistently approaches from the lateral side of the target edge (upper‑left to lower‑right across the frame for the right column; lateral‑left toward medial for the left slit). During knot tying on the left demonstration stitch, the needle driver and forceps cross over the incision to seat the knot over the center of the bite with balanced tension.

- Spatial relationships: Work at the right column’s inferior end is performed with the instruments converging over the wound’s lower third. When tidying, the right hand remains closest to the wound manipulating tails, while the left hand hovers above‑left with the needle driver or scissors. On the left slit, the working zone is usually at the superior end, with the needle driver just lateral to the bite site and the forceps immediately across the gap, ensuring perpendicular entry and consistent eversion.

Progression and counts along the right‑hand wound can be stated strictly from what is visible in each captured segment. Early looks show that this column already bears a run of simple interrupted stitches: in one view five are visible, in most others four are visible, and in a preparatory sequence only three are visible in the field while the next stitch is being set up at the bottom. Across all these right‑column segments, there is no complete passage and tie of a new stitch captured; the activity alternates between preparing to place the next stitch at the inferior end and adjusting the tension of existing knots. Consequently, visible suture counts along this right‑hand line do not increase within the recorded actions. The footage ends with a stable view of four completed simple interrupted sutures on this right incision.

Meanwhile, the left slit serves as a demonstration canvas: multiple starts of the first stitch at the superior end are shown, culminating once in a tied, finished stitch at the top of that slit. Additional starts are shown later without completion. These demonstrations exhibit consistent technique—perpendicular needle entry, short dermal bites, gentle edge handling, and properly centered knot placement when tying is shown—but they are not pursued to closure in this recording.

By the end, the story is clear: the right‑side wound remains the principal closed line in the field, its edges already well approximated by evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches, with the operator poised to add another at the bottom but not captured completing it in these frames.

Suture count verification and final state
- Final visible count on the right‑side incision in the closing frame: 4 completed simple interrupted sutures.
- No additional stitches are definitively placed and tied on this line within the captured sequences; preparatory passes and tensioning are shown, but the number of visible completed sutures does not increase in the footage.
- The right‑side wound edges are approximated with mild eversion around each knot; tails are present and untrimmed or minimally trimmed.
- The needle is loaded in the driver, tip oriented toward the right‑side incision, ready for the next stitch as the sequence ends.

Therefore, the procedure as captured results in a right‑sided wound bearing exactly four completed simple interrupted sutures at the end of the video.
