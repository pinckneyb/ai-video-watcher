Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
This is a competent simple interrupted closure completed with five evenly spaced sutures. The operator maintained mostly perpendicular passes and consistent bite geometry, used instrument ties correctly, and achieved reliable edge approximation with flat to slight eversion. Knot management was disciplined and the final line is clean with short tails. Areas to refine: maintain strict 90Â° entries on every bite, reduce regrasping and hand switching, and continue to limit forceps contacts to one precise grasp per edge. Overall, the work meets clinical standards with room for incremental improvement in efficiency and absolute consistency of needle angle.
