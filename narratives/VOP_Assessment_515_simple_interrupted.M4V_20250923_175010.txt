COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone suture pad that presents several parallel, vertical slit wounds. From the outset and without deviation, the operator commits to closing the second slit from the left—centrally located on the field—and all subsequent activity returns to this same line. The selected technique is a simple interrupted closure, and each segment of the video shows either placement or tying of individual stitches along that one incision, progressing from central passes to additional bites and knots toward the superior portion as the line is methodically completed. Throughout, the needle is held in a needle driver by the right hand, while the left hand alternates between tissue forceps and direct strand control. Forceps use is deliberate but not constant; at times the operator relies solely on the needle’s arc and strand management to maintain approximation, with eversion varying accordingly.

The sequence begins with the first pass on the target slit. The right hand approaches from above the pad, needle driver in hand, grasping the curved needle on its proximal third and presenting it perpendicular to the pad surface. The left hand reaches in from the lower left with tissue forceps to lift and slightly evert the far dermal edge, creating a stable, visible margin. In a controlled, wrist-driven motion, the needle is advanced orthogonally through the far side and then across to the near side, mirroring entry and exit depth to preserve alignment. This establishes an initial, balanced purchase of tissue without over-traumatizing the edge. The suture is then drawn through the path, preparing the ends for later tying; within these earliest frames, no knot is thrown, but the fundamental principles are clear: perpendicular needle orientation, symmetric bite placement, and coordinated bimanual control to protect eversion as the needle traverses.

As the pass is completed, the left hand continues to play a facilitative role with pickups, guiding the entry point and then retreating laterally as the right hand regrips and draws the needle through. The driver seizes the needle on exit to transfer traction to the strand, elevating a loop and pulling the suture across the incision. The thread is left spanning the wound, both tails visible and ready for tying. Again, no knot is tied within this phase, but the groundwork is laid: a clean, single pass of a simple interrupted stitch across the second-from-left slit, centered in the field.

The next segment documents completion of a simple interrupted cycle. Although the camera orientation briefly makes the active line appear second-from-right, instrument behavior and the persistence of prior landmarks confirm that work continues at the same incision. Here, the right hand remains over the chosen slit with the needle driver, while the left hand predominantly manages the free end of the suture rather than the wound edges—no forceps are used in this phase. The needle had been passed; now the suture is drawn out and oriented for tying. Using the driver, the operator executes instrument throws and cinches the knot directly over the incision. The result is a centered knot snugging the approximated edges together, with the strand managed leftward to maintain organization and prevent entanglement. Though lifting of edges is minimal in this segment, the knot sits appropriately over the line, indicative of a successful simple interrupted closure.

Following that, there is a brief interlude of strand management over the same slit. The right hand keeps the driver just above and to the right of the incision while controlling the needle and guiding the suture’s path; the left hand enters intermittently from the left or top to hold and tension the free limb. Pickups appear momentarily but are not used to grasp tissue. No new bite is placed in this moment; rather, the previously passed suture is being pulled through and tensioned across the slit, aligning the limbs and preparing the field for the next throw or the next stitch. The needle is held near its proximal third, kept perpendicular during repositioning, and the strand lies transversely across the wound while the ends are equalized.

With the first stitch secured and the field organized, attention returns to placing another simple interrupted pass across the same, centrally located slit. On this occasion, the right hand again positions the needle perpendicular to the pad, grasped at mid-body or proximal third depending on the regrip. The left hand manages the strand and, in this sequence, does not use forceps on the edges; thus, eversion is achieved primarily by the natural curvature of the needle and the deliberate orthogonal entry/exit. The bite depth appears moderate and equidistant from the margin on both sides. Immediately afterward, tying motions begin above the field, the needle parked safely in the driver as the right hand wraps and the left hand controls the opposite limb. Throws are formed with steady, controlled movements, bringing the knot down to the incision line.

The technique deepens with the next series of frames, in which forceps return to the left hand to refine edge control. The driver works from the right edge across midline, and the left forceps lightly evert the opposite edge to present tissue. The needle is oriented perpendicular, grasped about two-thirds from the tip, and advanced along its curve through the dermis. The operator repositions the driver as needed to continue the arc and then draws the suture through the exit. Again, the stitch is on the same incision; no other slits are engaged. The suture is advanced and pulled through with careful traction, setting up for knot tying on that segment.

Immediately after, the tying phase is captured clearly. The right hand maintains control of the driver and needle, but the needle itself is not driven—it's parked while instrument ties are formed. The driver alternates above the wound, wrapping the long strand around its tip and then grasping the free end to complete throws. The left hand’s forceps occasionally steady the near wound edge as the knot is cinched, but tissue handling remains gentle; the primary action is knot management. Cinching draws the knot directly over the slit, ensuring the suture sits across the incision without undue strangulation. Hands separate along the suture line to set tension, then re-approach for subsequent throws, demonstrating a consistent, methodical tying style.

In the next placement sequence, the operator again drives a pass through the same slit. The right hand keeps the driver just to the right of the wound’s centerline; the left hand enters from the left with tissue forceps—blue-handled early in this segment—and later transitions to using the index finger to control the suture tail. The needle is grasped on its body roughly one-third to halfway from the swage, oriented orthogonally to the pad. After penetrating the tissue, the driver regrips as needed to draw the needle through, the left hand briefly approximating and stabilizing the edges to guide the exit path. The stitch is left untied by the end of this sequence, both strands visible and equalized.

Preparation for another pass follows. The right hand holds the driver steady above the same incision, with the needle oriented near-perpendicular and poised to take the next bite. The left hand alternates between holding forceps and being empty; when engaged, the forceps elevate the left wound edge slightly, improving visualization and promoting slight eversion. The wound edges appear aligned, and the target line is centered in the field while adjacent slits remain untouched. The operator is essentially staging the next simple interrupted stitch, positioning both instrument and tissue before committing to penetration.

When the next bite is taken, the needle is grasped at an appropriate point on its curve—about two-thirds from the tip—perpendicular to the pad, and advanced through the dermis in a smooth arc. The forceps provide an assist as needed to stabilize the edge and then transfer to controlling the short tail as the right hand prepares to tie. The needle remains in the holder as the right hand uses it to wrap the long limb; the left hand holds the short tail to maintain counter-tension. Several throws secure the knot, which is seated cleanly and directly over the incision line, consistent with simple interrupted technique. This sequence demonstrates an efficient transition from tissue purchase to knot formation with minimal extraneous motion.

Building on that, the operator moves toward the superior aspect of the same incision to continue the row. The driver remains centered over the upper portion of the slit; the left hand alternates between grasping with Adsons and managing the thread. The forceps lift the left edge to enhance eversion, and the needle enters that side first, passes across at a uniform horizontal level, and exits the right edge. The long limb is drawn laterally and superiorly to clear the field and prepare for tying. Although the full tying sequence is not completed within this particular window, all the preparatory elements are in place: symmetric entry/exit, perpendicular needle orientation, and good control of the limbs’ relative positions to ensure the knot will land precisely over the wound.

A brief tightening and positioning phase follows near the superior end. The right hand, still holding the driver, manages the suture and positions tension to seat the most recent stitch. No new needle penetrations occur here; instead, the driver grasps the needle-suture junction or mid-needle to manipulate the strand and keep it aligned over the top of the wound. The left hand makes brief appearances to assist, but forceps are mostly parked and not engaged. The emphasis is on consolidating what has just been placed—aligning tension, ensuring the knot will be well seated, and confirming that prior stitches maintain approximation without gaps.

Attention then turns to evaluating the integrity and spacing of the closures along this same slit. The right hand with the driver hovers above and to the right of the stitch line, while the left index finger palpates lightly along the edges and over knots. This tactile check tests approximation, assesses whether eversion is adequate, and gauges whether any loops are overly tight or slack. No new bites are introduced. The line shows a short series of simple interrupted closures; loose strands are seen trailing, but the emphasis is inspection rather than placement.

The final moments are a last verification. The right hand is centered over the incision, the index finger pointing near the central stitches as if confirming alignment and tension. A needle holder is present above the wound at first and then moved away; a curved needle attached to suture remains visible at the field’s left margin but is not brought to the tissue. There is no manipulation of other incisions at any point. The operator does not add further throws or passes, suggesting satisfaction with the closure as achieved.

Taken together, the full chronology displays a coherent, consistent application of simple interrupted suturing along one vertical slit on the pad—the second from the left—starting near the center and extending toward the superior half. The technique remains faithful to core principles:

- Needle orientation: The driver repeatedly presents the needle perpendicular to the skin surface, optimizing bite geometry and minimizing the risk of edge inversion. Regripping mid-arc is used to maintain control and follow the needle’s curvature naturally through dermal tissue.

- Edge control: The left hand intermittently uses forceps to lift and evert the wound margins, especially during initial placements and later superior passes. In several segments, however, forceps are not used and eversion depends on the needle’s arc and careful perpendicular entry/exit. Where forceps were omitted, eversion appears less pronounced, though approximation is still maintained.

- Symmetric bites and spacing: Each pass shows an attempt to mirror bite depth and distance from the wound margin on both sides. The suture line builds in a measured, segmental fashion; knots sit centrally over the incision. Even when the operator is tying, the limbs are managed to keep loops low and aligned with the wound axis.

- Tying method: Instrument ties are the consistent choice. The needle is often parked in the driver during knot formation; the right hand forms the loops and retrieves the free end while the left hand maintains counter-tension on the opposite limb or steadies the edge. Knots are cinched down directly over the slit with controlled separation of the hands to set final tension.

- Spatial discipline: The driver remains close to and directly over the active line throughout, with the left hand approaching from the left side of the field. The suture is routed laterally and superiorly during setup and tying to avoid fouling the field. Even in the segment that appears to show a different incision due to camera orientation, the behavior of instruments and continuity of the suture path confirm continued focus on the same slit.

The evolution of hand positioning reflects increasing efficiency. Early on, the left hand pairs forceps with near-constant edge support during penetration; later, the operator alternates between tissue handling and strand control, sometimes using the index finger alone to manage the tail or to appose edges during knot snugging. The right hand’s control of the needle remains consistent and deliberate, with the regripping maneuvers smooth and predictable. During the tying phases, the right hand orchestrates loop formation while the left hand slides along the suture to provide the precise counter-tension needed to seat knots without over-tightening.

Throughout, the work remains confined to the single chosen incision. Adjacent slits are visible but never entered; all needle passes, strand management, and knots occur over the same vertical line. The sequence shows a logical alternation between placement and tying across successive segments: pass and pull-through, organize limbs, instrument tie to completion, then move slightly along the same incision for the next pass. Where knots are already seated, the operator performs tactile checks and minor strand adjustments, indicating attention to overall line quality and tissue health rather than rushing to add additional stitches without assessment.

By the end of the video, the central-left incision bears a short, well-aligned row of simple interrupted sutures spanning the center and extending toward the superior portion. Knots are centered over the wound, strand tails are visible but controlled, and the edges are approximated with generally symmetric bite placement. Eversion is present where forceps-assisted passes were used and more modest where reliance on the needle arc predominated; nevertheless, the closure remains functionally sound, with the wound edges apposed along the entirety of the treated segment. The final frames, which show inspection with the index finger and the needle holder being withdrawn, underscore that active placement has finished and the outcome is being confirmed. The incision remains the only focus from start to finish, demonstrating a consistent, methodical execution of simple interrupted suturing with careful attention to needle handling, knot placement, and strand tension at each stage.
