COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video follows a focused, stepwise closure of a single short vertical skin incision at the right side of the practice pad, progressing from initial bites through sequential interrupted stitches, knot‑seating and tail management, to a completed column of well‑approximated superficial sutures. Although a few early segments show little or no activity or occasional obscured hand/instrument detail, the procedure consistently returns to and advances along the same right‑side vertical wound, adding interrupted stitches sequentially from one end of the wound toward the other and finishing with the sutured line secured and dressed.

Opening survey and intermittent inactivity (0.0–44.0s)
The earliest frames show the pad with three parallel slits; at times the central incision is visually prominent, but no sustained work occurs there. Between 0.0 and 14.0 seconds a single gloved hand briefly sweeps over the pad from the top‑right, but no needle, needle driver or suture pass is visible and the wound edges remain gaped. Similarly, two silent segments (15.0–29.0s and 30.0–44.0s) document the pad without hands or instruments: the three incisions are present, but no active manipulation occurs and no suture material is seen. These early idle intervals provide context and scale (rulers visible) but do not change the operative plan; they are followed by repeated, consistent engagement of the right‑most short vertical incision for closure.

Initial placement of the first right‑side interrupted stitch (45.0–89.0s)
Active work begins in earnest on the short vertical incision in the upper‑right quadrant. The operator adopts a two‑handed technique: a needle driver (held in one hand) and fine toothed forceps/Adson pickup (held in the other) are used in concert. The curved needle is grasped in the needle driver—often near the body or mid‑shaft—so the operator can rotate and control the arc. The forceps present and gently evert the near edge while the driver advances the needle through the opposite edge in a short arc; needle orientation is typically perpendicular‑to‑oblique to the skin surface and the pass proceeds from lateral to medial relative to the wound. Bites are shallow, superficial to mid‑dermal on the synthetic pad, and are taken close to the wound edge to bring epidermal margins together without wide eversion.

A single interrupted suture is formed: after the needle completes its pass and the suture material is drawn through, the free tail is manipulated and the first knot is begun. During this early sequence the hands remain close to the incision—within a few centimeters of one another—with the needle driver typically approaching from above/medial and the forceps from lateral/inferior. The motion and grip are controlled and deliberate, establishing the technical pattern that will be repeated.

Supplemental passes and early knot management (90.0–164.0s)
Work continues at the same right‑lateral puncture/stab site and at adjacent short vertical defects just to its medial side. Multiple frames show the needle held at different positions along the shaft—at times nearer the swage for precise entry, at others more distal or mid‑shaft to permit rotation or extraction. The non‑dominant hand consistently stabilizes tissue and controls suture tails with toothed forceps while the dominant hand manipulates the needle driver.

During the 105.0–164.0s window the operator moves between taking fresh bites and completing previously passed stitches. Several frames capture the passage of the needle through epidermis/dermis, followed by pulling the suture through, looping for a knot and then tensioning. There are episodes of instrument tying—needle driver and forceps working closely (<2–3 cm apart) to seat throws—and brief cutting or trimming of tails with a curved instrument or scissors. Edges are approximated as knots are tightened; the technique remains a simple interrupted pattern with each stitch set individually and knotted before the next bite.

Progression to a vertical column: sequential interrupted stitches (165.0–240.0s)
From around 165 seconds onward, the operator consistently focuses on a short vertical incision located on the right third of the pad. A previously placed stitch sits at the inferior end of the working zone, and the subsequent work is performed immediately adjacent and superior to that point. Two‑handed coordination is evident in these frames: one hand holds the needle driver and the other holds toothed forceps to present tissue and manage the suture.

Needle passes are deliberate, with the curved needle held near mid‑shaft and oriented to make short perpendicular‑to‑oblique bites from lateral to medial across the incision edge. The forceps lift and align the near edge to achieve slight eversion and good epidermal apposition as the needle traverses the opposite lip. Suture material is pulled through and manipulated for knot formation; at times the sequence shows the operator dressing the suture tail, regrasping the needle for a final pass, or pulling the loop tight for an instrument tie.

As this phase advances, additional interrupted sutures are added in sequence along the same short vertical wound, producing an emergent column of closely spaced, evenly distributed stitches. The pattern is methodical: pass the needle, draw the suture, approximate edges, tie and trim, then move slightly superior (or inferior depending on the frame) for the next bite.

Consolidation of the stitch column and alternating driving/tension maneuvers (240.0–314.0s)
Mid‑procedure frames show the operator repeatedly returning to the same right‑side incision and building on the existing row of sutures. Two preplaced interrupted stitches are visible in several frames, and the operator adds another stitch immediately superior to those anchors. The needle driver is seen grasping the curved needle at different positions to adapt to the specific action—both for precise tissue penetration and for knot seating or suture manipulation—and the forceps remain integral to control edge alignment and suture tension.

At this stage the work fluctuates between needle passes and knot management: some frames show fresh needle insertion and traversal of the dermal edge; others show the needle being manipulated mainly to help pull and seat a knot or to wind throws for an instrument tie. The bites remain superficial and close to the margin, designed to achieve epidermal apposition without deep tissue capture. Hands maintain a compact working envelope, usually within 1–4 cm of each other and the wound; the driver typically approaches from a lateral/upper quadrant while forceps stabilize from the medial/lower side.

Rhythmic placement of additional interrupted stitches (315.0–374.0s)
The operator continues adding interrupted sutures along the same right‑side short vertical line. Frames in this interval show the needle driver and forceps almost continuously engaged: the needle is repeatedly grasped near the tip or midbody to place short perpendicular bites, while the forceps lift the opposite edge for eversion and control. The technique is consistent—curved needle, two‑handed opposition, shallow bites—yielding a steadily lengthening column of evenly spaced, superficially apposed stitches.

In a few frames the needle driver is used more to manipulate suture loops and perform knot throws than to penetrate tissue, indicating that each stitch is being individually secured before the next bite. The overall rhythm is one of methodical repetition: bite, pull, tie, trim, advance.

Final throws, tightening and inspection (375.0–449.0s)
As the suture column approaches completion, activity shifts subtly toward securing and refining the knots and managing suture tails. Several frames depict instrument ties—needle driver and forceps working closely to seat throws—followed by trimming of tails and inspection of approximation. The hands remain in close proximity over the right incision, with the forceps often stabilizing the suture tails while the driver performs the tying motions.

Some frames in this period show minimal new needle passages because the operator is occupied with finishing previously placed stitches—trimming, tension adjustment and ensuring consistent eversion and apposition along the column. The stitches that have been placed present with slight eversion, uniform spacing (~5–8 mm estimated), and closely approximated epidermal edges.

Terminal assessment and minor adjustments (450.0–479.0s)
The closing segment documents the final maneuvers: addition of the most cephalad or most superior stitch where needed, final knot tightening, and trimming of residual suture tails. The row of interrupted sutures now forms a contiguous vertical series along the right‑side wound; in many frames five to six completed knots are visible, all set with short tails and securing well‑approximated skin edges. Hands sometimes obscure instrument detail, but the consistent pattern of instrument grips, needle arcs, forceps elevation and instrument tying demonstrates a completed interrupted suture closure.

Technique characteristics and evolution
Throughout the video the operator employs a consistent simple interrupted technique: each stitch is individually placed through the superficial dermal/epidermal layer, drawn taut to approximate skin margins, and secured with instrument ties. The curved needle is the chosen implement; the needle is commonly grasped in the mid‑shaft or distal third depending on the task (mid‑shaft for driving, more distal for delicate tip control), and its arc is used to make short perpendicular‑to‑oblique passes. Forceps consistently provide counter‑traction, present the near edge, and manage suture tails during knot formation.

There is little evidence of layered or deep closure—no undermining, no deep laminar bites—indicating the focus is solely on superficial approximation appropriate for the simulated dermal pad. Eversion is modest and deliberate in many bites to promote epidermal edge alignment. Instrument usage is largely uniform: one hand controls the needle driver while the other controls toothed tissue forceps; when tying, the hands often cross closely over the wound to effect instrument ties.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Hand approaches vary slightly over time and frames—occasionally the needle driver is seen in the right hand, at other times in the left—but the functional roles are consistent: a driver delivers and manipulates the needle while forceps provide tissue control and suture management. Entry vectors are predominantly from the lateral/top‑right quadrant of the frame, with the non‑dominant hand stabilizing from the medial/right or lower side. As the stitch column grows, the operator moves cephalad (or inferior to superior depending on the pass) along the same incision, always keeping both instruments in a tight working envelope immediately adjacent to the wound (commonly within 1–4 cm).

Technique consistency and minor variability
The suturing approach remains broadly consistent: interrupted bites placed at close spacing with instrument ties. Minor variability is observed in needle grasp position and which hand holds the driver; these changes reflect normal intra‑operative adjustments (regrasping for extraction, switching grip for knot delivery) and camera perspective rather than a change in closure strategy. A few early and mid segments show partial obscuration or an absence of instruments in frame, which limits the ability to confirm needle orientation in those instants—these are noted deficiencies but do not alter the clear pattern of sequential interrupted closure established elsewhere.

Final state of the wound
At the end of the recording the right‑side short vertical incision is closed with a continuous column of interrupted sutures: a series of uniformly spaced, superficially placed stitches with knots seated and tails trimmed. The wound edges lie in close apposition with slight eversion at the stitch sites, producing an even, secure superficial closure across the length of the defect. No deep layer work, undermining, or complex mattress patterns are evident—the repair is a straightforward, reproducible interrupted skin closure executed with coordinated two‑handed technique and attention to edge alignment and knot security.
