COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on a practice pad marked with three parallel vertical incisions. For a brief span there is no operative motion; a gloved hand and a couple of swaged sutures sit idle near the ruler at the top of the field while the pad’s slits remain untouched and slightly gaping. This quiet beginning gives way to a deliberate, methodical closure that stays focused on the short vertical wound on the right side of the pad. From the first true engagement onward, that right‑side slit remains the only cut that is actively sutured and completed.

Work begins at the inferior portion of that right‑edge incision. The operator brings in needle drivers from above and slightly to the left of the wound while forceps arrive from the right. The curved needle is mounted in the driver about two‑thirds from the tip, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface so that it can naturally follow its arc. The right forceps gently grasp the near (lateral/right) wound margin, lifting it just enough to evert the edge and expose an entry site a few millimeters from the cut. With the tissue stabilized, the needle tip meets the epidermal edge and advances through the synthetic dermis. The driver re-grasps the needle as needed to complete the arc and hand the tip across to the forceps on the far side, and the suture is pulled through cleanly. The free strand is controlled off to the right, clear of the working tips.

The first stitch is secured with instrument ties rather than hand ties. The forceps release tissue and are used intermittently to steady the suture or manage the tail, while the driver manipulates the loop. Throws are laid down deliberately, alternating directions to seat a square knot low against the skin without strangulating the tissue. The tail is maintained laterally to the right for tension control, and the knot is positioned consistently to one side of the incision. Early on, the operator keeps the stitches low-profile and the edges evenly approximated with slight eversion. The first knot is tightened and the stitch is completed at the lower third of the slit.

With the foundation in place, the operator continues up the same vertical line. At the next working interval a second stitch is initiated just superior to the first. The driver again holds the needle at the proximal third of the arc, perpendicular to the pad, and the forceps present each wound edge in turn to keep the bites symmetric. Depending on hand position and approach, entry alternates between near‑to‑far and far‑to‑near, but the essential geometry is consistent: bites taken a predictable distance from the edge, matched in depth and spacing to the prior stitch. After passage, the suture is drawn through and instrument ties secure the stitch over the incision. The operator uses controlled, alternating throws, cinching them down without lifting the wound edges out of plane. Excess is trimmed when appropriate with gold‑handled suture scissors introduced briefly, then withdrawn to keep the field uncluttered.

As the line builds, the hands switch roles at times. In some sequences the left hand is the primary driver hand hovering above the wound with the right hand working the forceps; in others the right hand controls the needle driver while the left provides counter-traction with pickups. Despite that alternation, the relationship of the instruments to the wound remains consistent: one instrument (driver) crosses the incision perpendicular to its long axis to guide the needle’s arc; the other (forceps) opposes it at the margin being penetrated to stabilize tissue, achieve eversion, and occasionally re-grasp the needle tip to help pull it through. The suture is always managed to avoid entanglement with the other cuts on the pad.

After the initial stitches are placed, a period of knot management follows. The driver holds the suture rather than the needle while throws are formed and seated. The wound edges remain supported by the already-placed stitch while the knot is tightened; the forceps sometimes pinch near the exit site to keep the loop from riding up as the knot is delivered. The operator alternates the direction of each instrument tie, producing square knots seated laterally along the incision. Tails are trimmed with care, leaving neat, short ends.

The closure progresses superiorly along the same slit. A new bite is taken slightly above the last completed knot: the needle is reloaded in the driver, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and positioned at the next target site. The forceps present the right edge, and the needle arcs across to the left, maintaining equal bite width and depth across both sides. In some passes the operator deliberately takes the far edge first and then reorients for the near edge—a classic far‑to‑near, near‑to‑far sequence used to ensure symmetric approximation when the access angle demands it. In others, the needle proceeds near‑to‑far in a single smooth motion; both tactics yield the same outcome: small, even, full‑thickness dermal bites with slight eversion and no gapping between edges.

Interspersed with these passes are maintenance steps: knot tying on recently placed stitches, tensioning of the standing end to set the approximation, and tail trimming. The driver and forceps work a few millimeters from the wound, keeping the instruments parallel to the incision to preserve visibility. In the middle of the sequence, after a series of stitches have been secured and trimmed, the operator introduces a fresh needle–suture, loading it with the curve directed toward the incision to continue the line. This transition occurs seamlessly: one knot is finalized and cut, then the new needle is positioned immediately adjacent to the last stitch to extend the closure upward.

Near the upper portion of the slit, the operator’s technique remains disciplined. Bites are planned at a consistent distance from the edge, and the curved needle follows its arc with the driver pronating and supinating to maintain perpendicularity. The non‑dominant hand’s forceps remain gentle on the epidermal edge, grasping just enough dermis to evert without crushing. After the needle traverses both sides, the suture is drawn through; slack is controlled and slack loops are cleared from the field. Instrument ties are then formed, with the knot delivered laterally as before. As each knot is seated, the edges show uniform apposition following the vertical axis of the wound.

At several intervals the sequence pauses for setup or repositioning without new tissue passage. The needle may be “parked” in the driver while an existing knot is tied, or the driver may hold the suture itself during a series of throws. The assistant instrument alternates between forceps and scissors—forceps to stabilize tissue and manage the suture, scissors to trim tails once a knot is secure. These pauses are brief and do not alter the steady progression along the same right‑side incision.

Once the closure reaches the superior end, a final stitch is placed and tied. The needle is grasped about one‑third from the swaged end, the arc is aligned, and the tip passes through with the same attention to edge eversion and symmetry seen in earlier stitches. After passage, the suture is brought across, the knot is laid down with alternating throws, and the final tails are trimmed. The superior end of the line is tidied: the operator tensions the standing end, exposes the knot with forceps, and trims to a consistent length. The entire wound now shows a contiguous series of small, evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures with short, uniform tails; edges are approximated without visible dog-ears or inversion.

Throughout the operation, the broader field remains stable. The two slits not being closed—particularly the central vertical incision—are left alone, even though they’re visible in the field. At one point, a brief view suggests a horizontal cut near the lower right is being handled. On closer observation, that moment reflects suture management at the inferior end of the same right‑side wound, not a change in the closure target; the operator is using the driver to perform instrument ties and tensioning near the lower portion of the vertical slit, and the orientation of the camera or suture strand creates a transient horizontal impression. Later, there is a short interval where instruments move over toward the left slit and appear to set up for a bite; this detour never progresses to a pass or a knot. It serves as a momentary exploration or repositioning, and the procedure resumes—and ultimately concludes—on the same right‑side incision that has been the focus throughout.

As the final frames unfold, the right‑side wound stands closed from inferior to superior with a neat vertical column of simple interrupted stitches. In the last active sequences, the operator adds one more stitch near the top, maintaining consistent spacing and technique. The forceps continue to evert the edge lightly, the needle driver delivers the needle perpendicular to the skin, and the suture is drawn through without snag. The loop is tightened with controlled instrument ties, the knot is seated laterally, and the tails are trimmed with scissors. Subsequent frames show instrument withdrawal and brief periods with no hands in the field while the row of sutures remains unchanged—evidence that no further additions are needed.

By the end, the closure demonstrates the hallmarks of a careful, consistent simple interrupted technique:

- Entry and exit points on each side of the slit are symmetric and at comparable distances from the wound edge, yielding even approximation.
- Edges are slightly everted along the entire length, aided by gentle forceps handling and perpendicular needle passage.
- Knots are square, seated just to the side of the incision, and trimmed to short, uniform tails to minimize bulk and avoid crossing the wound.
- Tension across each stitch is balanced—firm enough to hold approximation, but not so tight as to cause blanching or tissue strangulation.

Hand usage evolves naturally with the operator’s workflow. Sometimes the left hand is dominant on the driver, sometimes the right; the forceps hand mirrors the driver, opposing across the incision to present tissue, re‑grasp the needle, or control the suture tail. Scissors are introduced at the end of tying sequences and withdrawn promptly. The spatial choreography remains constant: the driver works just medial/superior to the target bite site while the forceps approach from the lateral/right side, with both tips converging over the incision line; during tying, the driver and forceps alternate to lay throws and deliver the knot low into the wound without lifting the edges.

After the final trimming at the superior end, there is a quiet denouement: instruments leave the field, and the right‑side incision sits closed with a continuous vertical line of evenly spaced sutures. The central and left incisions remain untouched by closure efforts in this session. The completed wound shows no gapping along its length, and the series of knots and short tails are aligned neatly to one side, indicating secured, finished work. The procedure concludes with that right‑edge laceration fully approximated, its simple interrupted closure consistent from the first foundational stitch at the inferior end to the tidy finishing knot at the superior end.
