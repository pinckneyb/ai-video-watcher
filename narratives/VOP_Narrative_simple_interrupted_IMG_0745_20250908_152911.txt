============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on the short central vertical incision of the practice pad; the two longer lateral slits are visible but never manipulated.

It begins at the upper third of the central cut. The left hand uses Adson forceps to lift and evert the dermal edge, while the right hand, with a needle driver, holds the curved needle on its body about two‑thirds from the tip. The needle is set perpendicular to the skin and driven in a smooth arc through one lip of the wound, across the gap, and out the opposite lip. The driver regrips the needle to complete the arc and the suture is pulled through, leaving a single pass across the defect ready for tying.

With the pass complete, the team secures the first simple‑interrupted stitch. The right hand keeps the driver just to the right of midline to form and deliver instrument throws; the left hand alternates between forceps for edge control and pinching the short suture end to act as the post. Square throws are cinched with horizontal tension across the incision, approximating and slightly everting the edges without blanching. The knot is seated at the superior portion of the wound, then the right hand briefly switches to scissors to trim the tails. One neatly trimmed stitch now supports the top of the central slit.

Attention then moves a short distance inferior to place the second stitch. The left hand again picks up the left edge just back from the margin to present the dermis; the right hand “chokes up” on the needle (grasped closer to one‑third from the tip for fine control) and delivers a perpendicular dermal bite across the wound. After passage, the driver releases the needle and transitions to knot‑tying. Alternating instrument throws are applied while the left hand stabilizes the tissue and, as needed, holds the free end to set each throw. The edges draw together evenly, and by the end of this sequence the second knot is fully seated and the tails are cut. Two simple interrupted sutures now span the upper and mid portions of the central incision; the lateral slits remain untouched.

Work progresses to the lower third for a third stitch. The left hand uses forceps to evert the lower margins, exposing the dermis. The right hand, with the needle grasped roughly two‑thirds from the tip and oriented perpendicular to the skin, takes a measured bite from the patient’s right lower edge across to the left. The needle is reloaded as needed to mirror the bite on the opposite edge; the thread is drawn through and trails superiorly. Without driving the needle further, the right‑hand driver now controls the standing end to tie. The driver’s jaws serve as the post and knot pusher, while the left hand manages the suture tail and intermittently steadies the tissue with forceps. Square throws snug down across the wound line, seating the third knot at the inferior aspect of the previously open segment. Scissors then trim the tails, leaving three evenly spaced, trimmed interrupted sutures down the central cut; slight puckering confirms secure approximation.

With three knots in place, the team begins a fourth stitch at the very bottom of the same incision to complete the line. The left hand tents the inferior left edge to present the dermis; the right hand positions the needle perpendicular to the skin, grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, and advances to start the next bite. Once both edges are captured, the needle is parked out of the way and instrument ties are performed. The right‑hand driver works just below and over the new inferior bite, functioning as a knot pusher; the left hand briefly lifts the left edge to steady the tissue as the knot is cinched. The edges approximate without excess tension. By the final moments, this fourth knot is seated at the bottom of the wound, though its tails have not yet been cut.

Across the sequence, the pattern is consistent: simple interrupted sutures placed from superior to inferior on the central incision, each bite delivered perpendicular to the skin with even, symmetric purchase and deliberate eversion. The left hand primarily everts and stabilizes with toothed forceps or controls the free suture end; the right hand drives the needle, then transitions to instrument ties and, when needed, scissors for tail trimming. Instrument movements remain tightly focused along and across the central wound axis, with throws delivered horizontally and the driver crossing over the incision as required to secure square knots. The session concludes with four interrupted sutures in place on the central line—three tied and trimmed, and the most inferior tied but not yet cut—while the lateral practice incisions remain undisturbed throughout.
