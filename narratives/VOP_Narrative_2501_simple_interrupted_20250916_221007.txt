COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic suture pad with three parallel vertical incisions, but throughout the sequence the operator consistently works on the rightmost vertical wound at the pad’s lateral edge. Early camera angles make this line appear shorter or, at one moment, even oblique, and one brief early segment shows a pass over the central slit; however, the continuity of hand position, instrument use, suture strand trajectory, and the repeated return to the same right-edge wound with the same growing row of knots confirms a single, continuous closure of the rightmost vertical incision using simple interrupted sutures. Any apparent deviations reflect framing changes rather than a change of the wound being closed.

Initial setup and first pass (0–44 s)
The session begins with preparation for the first bite on the rightmost vertical incision. The left hand controls the needle driver while the right hand lifts and everts the right wound edge with tissue forceps, orienting the curved needle perpendicular to the skin for a 90-degree entry. The tip is aligned just off the right margin to take a robust dermal bite. Immediately after, the perspective briefly shifts and shows a pass over the central slit; no knot is placed and no suture is left there, and a moment later the field returns to the right-edge wound where the same technique resumes. The right hand now holds the driver, the left hand stabilizes the tissue with fingers, and the needle is driven across the rightmost incision. A loop is formed in preparation for tying, but no knot is secured within these earliest frames.

First knot completion and cut (45–89 s)
With one simple stitch already visible near the upper–mid portion of the rightmost incision, the operator places another pass just inferior to it. While that second bite is drawn through, attention returns to the lower third of the wound where the previously passed stitch is cinched. The right hand manipulates the driver and the left hand helps tension the free end to seat a flat, squared throw. The knot is tightened neatly at the lower third, then the left hand introduces scissors from the superior-left and trims the ends to short tails. At this stage, one completed simple interrupted suture is firmly in place on the rightmost incision.

Setting up the second stitch (90–134 s)
Now working just below the upper-third knot, the left hand returns with the needle driver, the right hand uses forceps to gently evert and present the right wound edge, and the needle is aligned for the next pass. Over the subsequent frames, the curved needle is controlled near its proximal-to-mid third, kept perpendicular to the pad surface, and oriented to traverse the incision symmetrically. The tissue handling is careful and consistent: slight elevation of the right edge with forceps during entry and deliberate arc-driven rotation through the tissue. While the intervening tying sequence is not fully displayed, by the time the field is viewed again moments later, two tied stitches are present in the lower half of the incision.

Second knot secured; third stitch begins (135–179 s)
With two completed simple interrupted sutures seated in the lower half, the driver (in the right hand) and the assisting hand (alternating between forceps and fingers) shift focus proximally. The needle is repeatedly regrasped near its proximal third to maintain control and alignment as the operator moves toward the superior portion of the same wound. The forceps lift the right wound margin just below the existing sutures, and the driver enters perpendicular to the skin to begin the next stitch, laying out an orderly progression of bites from inferior to superior.

Passing but not yet tying the third (180–209 s)
Two knots remain tied at this point, and the operator advances the needle from the right wound edge across the incision at the superior end of the partially closed segment. The pass is clean, with the left hand assisting by stabilizing and everting at the bite site. The thread is pulled through, leaving a clean arc across the gap, but the knot is not yet thrown in these frames. In a brief shift of angle, the wound appears obliquely oriented; in context, this is the same right-edge line, with the obliquity due to camera perspective. Control remains precise: the right hand with the driver manages the needle, the left hand maintains gentle countertension on the tissue or the strand. Still, the count is steady at two completed sutures, with a third pass prepared.

Third knot completion (210–224 s)
Returning to the superior end where the new pass was made, the right hand (with the driver) and the left hand (controlling the free and short strands) now tie the third stitch. The throws are instrument-tied: the needle is parked safely on the long strand, loops are formed with the driver, and alternating directions maintain square knots. The edges are already well approximated by the lower sutures, so only gentle tension is required to seat the new knot without strangulation. By the end of this sequence, a third simple interrupted suture is fully secured; three knots now span the mid-portion of the rightmost incision.

Fourth stitch in progress; trimming and tensioning (225–269 s)
With three knots established, the operator begins the next stitch proximal to the existing series. The needle is grasped at the proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and driven in an arc from the right wound edge across to the left, with wrist supination/pronation to guide a smooth rotation. Forceps in the right hand help evert and control the near edge when used; at other moments, the operator relies on precise needle control and finger stabilization without forceps. The suture is drawn across the gap and laid out of the field to the lower-right to avoid tangling. During this interval the tying is not captured to completion, and trimming sequences focus on tidying the now-established three knots—aligning them and clipping stray ends—maintaining an orderly field. The count remains three completed sutures, with a fourth clearly in progress at the superior portion.

Advancing to four completed sutures (270–299 s)
Attention stays at the upper half of the same right-edge wound. The right hand holds the driver and regrips the needle to refine trajectory; the left hand alternates between forceps to stabilize the far (left) edge and fingers to manage the free limb. The pass for the new stitch is completed, the thread is drawn through, and tying proceeds off and on camera. When the field is revisualized, four completed simple interrupted sutures are visible along the rightmost slit. The spacing is regular, the edges approximated with mild eversion, and the tails are kept short and tidy.

Tying and managing the upper stitches; preparing the final pass (300–359 s)
The operator now works near the superior end of the wound to add another stitch and ensure consistent closure all the way up. In one sequence, three completed stitches are visible while a fourth is being tied; in subsequent frames, four completed stitches are clearly present as the top stitch is tightened and tails trimmed. These minor variations reflect camera framing rather than true changes in suture count. Through these moments, the technique remains consistent:

- The driver is held mainly in the right hand, sometimes in the left, demonstrating ambidextrous control.
- The needle is grasped on its proximal third for secure rotation; entry angles remain close to 90 degrees relative to the skin to harvest symmetric bites.
- The assisting hand uses forceps only as needed to evert edges without crushing the tissue; otherwise, it controls tension on the standing end and helps present the bite site.
- During knot tying, the needle is parked safely on the long limb away from the wound to avoid accidental injury, and the driver forms alternating, flat throws to seat square knots. Eversion is maintained, and no excessive tension is applied that would blanch the simulated skin.

At this point the mid-to-inferior portion is secured by four knots, and work concentrates at the superior-most segment to place the next interrupted stitch with the same methodical bimanual setup across the wound.

Top-end finish: tying, trimming, and final inspection (360–389 s)
The final operational sequences show the dominant hand with the needle driver working at the upper third of the right-edge wound while the nondominant hand stabilizes the tissue or briefly uses fine forceps for precise edge control. A new pass is taken near the top, the suture is drawn across, and tensioning is performed to snug the stitch without overcompression. The next frames capture the finesse work: with the needle parked on the long limb, the operator tensions the most superior stitch, then introduces scissors from the upper right to trim tails flush, maintaining neat, short ends. Throughout these views, four completed sutures remain visible in the camera’s frame; given the tight zoom on the top of the wound, the remainder of the line may be partially out of view. The closure pattern remains uniform simple interrupted throughout—no running components, no mattress configurations, and no deep dermal elements are introduced.

Final state and suture count verification (390–398 s)
After a drape briefly passes over the field, the final static view shows the rightmost vertical incision fully closed with five completed simple interrupted sutures, each with visible knots and tails. No hands or instruments are present; there is no further manipulation. The two central slits remain untouched. Edge apposition is complete, spacing is even, and tails are neatly trimmed. This terminal view is definitive for suture counting.

Hand position evolution and instrument use across the case
- Early alignment and entry: The case opens with the driver and forceps opposing each other across the rightmost wound. The driver initially appears in the left hand with forceps in the right, then settles into a pattern with the driver in the right hand and the left hand alternating between forceps and finger stabilization. This variation reflects comfort and access rather than a change in target.
- Midcase rhythm: As additional stitches are placed, the right hand with the driver hovers just lateral and slightly superior to the current bite site, while the left hand manages the free limb and gently everts the tissue with forceps as needed. During tying, the needle is deliberately parked on the standing limb away from the wound so the driver can form throws and the assistant hand can tension the short tail. The scissors enter briefly, cut tails, and withdraw to keep the field uncluttered.
- Superior finish: Near the top of the wound, the bimanual setup tightens: driver and forceps straddle the wound line across the planned entry to control trajectory and tissue presentation. Short, controlled wrist rotations drive the curved needle in an arc perpendicular to the skin. Once each pass is complete, the driver regrips the needle, sets up for the next move, and the assistant hand secures the field with countertension. Tying remains instrument-based with alternating throws to form square knots.

Technique consistency and edge handling
The suturing pattern remains simple interrupted from start to finish, in alignment with the technique selection. Every stitch is an independent pass-and-tie, with bites taken perpendicular to the wound to maintain symmetry and mild eversion. The operator uses tissue forceps judiciously—enough to present the dermal edge without crushing the simulated skin. Knot tying is performed with the needle controlled on the long strand to reduce risk, and tails are cut short for a clean, professional finish. Throughout, no running sequences, horizontal or vertical mattress variations, or deep dermal layers are introduced; the closure is a textbook series of simple interrupted skin stitches on a linear wound.

Suture progression and exact count over time
- Start (0–44 s): No completed sutures. First pass on the rightmost incision is prepared and placed.
- Lower-third finish (45–89 s): The first stitch is tied and trimmed at the lower third. Count: 1.
- Building the line (90–134 s): The next pass is prepared near the upper third, and tying proceeds; by the later view, two knots are present. Count: 2.
- Advancing proximally (135–209 s): A third pass is placed at the superior end; tying is not immediately shown.
- Third knot secured (210–224 s): The third stitch is tied. Count: 3.
- Fourth in progress (225–269 s): A proximal pass is made for the next stitch; trimming of earlier knots occurs; tying not yet complete. Count holds at 3.
- Fourth completed (270–299 s): The superior stitch is tied; four knots are now visible. Count: 4.
- Superior refinement (300–389 s): Additional tying, tensioning, and trimming occur near the wound’s top; the camera intermittently shows three or four knots due to framing, but the closure continues to progress in the same pattern.
- Final confirmation (390–398 s): The field is static with five completed simple interrupted sutures visible along the rightmost vertical incision. Final count: 5.

Mandatory suture count verification
- Total completed sutures visible at the end: 5.
- Final state: The rightmost vertical wound is fully closed with five evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches, knots seated flat with short tails, and edges gently everted and well approximated.
- Progression summary: The count rose from 0 to 1 after the first knot was tied and cut, increased to 2 as the second was secured, then to 3 when the superior stitch was tied. A fourth was added and completed as work moved proximally, and ultimately a fifth was in place by the final static view.

In summary, the operator closes the right-edge vertical incision with a methodical series of simple interrupted sutures, proceeding from the lower third toward the superior end. Instrument handling is controlled and consistent, with careful edge presentation, perpendicular needle entry, and instrument-tied square knots whose tails are trimmed neatly. While some frames briefly suggest a different orientation or show counts limited by camera framing, the continuous workflow and the final static view confirm the procedure’s outcome: five completed simple interrupted sutures securing the rightmost vertical incision.
