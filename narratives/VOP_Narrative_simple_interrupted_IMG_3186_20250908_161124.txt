============================================================
The session opens on the long vertical cut at the far left. The edges are freshened at the inferior corner and stabilized with forceps while the needle and driver are readied. The needle is transferred into the driver and oriented perpendicular to the skin, with the hands straddling the slit: right hand on forceps at the far edge for control and eversion, left hand on the driver along the near edge preparing the first bite. Early movements are preparatory—tenting and aligning at the lower segment—before the work shifts decisively to the superior end to begin closure.

At the top of the incision, the right hand lifts the margin with Adson forceps to evert the edge, and the left hand advances the curved needle forehand, grasped about two‑thirds from the tip for precise control. The first passes concentrate on the near (left) edge: the needle enters a few millimeters from the margin, perpendicular to the surface, through dermis and subdermis. The suture is drawn through and the needle is reloaded. Throughout, the instruments oppose one another across the wound, tips meeting just inside the incision with the driver slightly inferior to the forceps, maintaining clean perpendicular bites and consistent spacing.

With the near‑edge bites established and the strand pulled through, attention turns to completing the corner stitch. The needle is driven near‑to‑far across the top of the wound, exiting symmetrically on the opposite lip where the forceps present the target. The suture is retrieved and brought through. Hand positions remain consistent: right hand forceps everting the far edge and guiding exits; left hand driving, then regrasping the needle to finish the pass. A standard simple interrupted knot is tied, seating the tissue with slight eversion and leaving short tails. This creates the first completed stitch at the superior end. Suture count on this line: 1.

Work then continues just below the corner. The forceps again lift the far edge, and the driver brings the needle from the left side for another forehand pass. The tip engages the left epidermal edge a few millimeters from the cut and advances toward the right edge. These frames show the needle pass phase and thread pull‑through only; no knot is thrown here. Later, another initiating bite is taken with the free end drawn out and scissors briefly enter to trim a tag, indicating thread management around the newly placed bite while maintaining exposure for the next throw.

Throughout the sequence, technique remains consistent: simple interrupted suturing with perpendicular, evenly spaced bites; edges are gently everted with Adson forceps; the needle is grasped at its mid‑to‑distal third for controlled arcs; and the driver and forceps work in opposition, converging over the wound to keep bites symmetric. The operator begins at the superior end and proceeds caudally, establishing the corner stitch first and then initiating the next stitch directly below it.

Final state: the left vertical incision has one completed simple interrupted suture securing the superior end, with an additional stitch initiated below (thread passed, not yet tied). Total completed sutures visible on this line at the end: 1.
