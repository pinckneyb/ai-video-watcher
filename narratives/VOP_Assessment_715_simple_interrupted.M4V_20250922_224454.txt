COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a single, continuous closure focused on one wound: the vertical slit at the far right edge of the training pad. Although there are brief moments early in the recording when the needle driver approaches a different cut and a short demonstration pass is made along an oblique line, no sustained suturing occurs on those other cuts. All actual closure work—needle passes, pull‑through, and instrument ties—proceeds on the right‑most vertical incision, and the narrative below follows that line from setup through completion.

At the very start, the operator appears to be orienting to the field. The needle driver briefly hovers over the second‑from‑left vertical slit while the operator’s head intermittently obscures the view. No bite is taken there and no tissue is stabilized with forceps before the view is blocked, suggesting an aborted setup rather than a committed start. Shortly afterward, the operator establishes the true working line: the far‑right vertical incision. The left hand adopts the needle driver, while the right hand uses Adson pickups to evert the right wound edge at the lower‑right aspect of that slit. The needle is loaded about the proximal third, aligned perpendicular to the pad. A controlled wrist arc advances the needle across, and the driver then re‑grasps near the needle’s swage to retrieve and draw the suture through. This opening maneuver on the right‑most slit represents the first clearly executed pass on the eventual closure line and sets the technique pattern seen throughout: deliberate, perpendicular needle orientation with careful control of thread and edges.

Immediately after this, there is a short interlude where the needle driver works over a long oblique incision in the lower‑right quadrant near the pad’s edge. A pass is placed there with proper needle orientation and the thread is drawn through, but this detour ends quickly; there is no tying there and no subsequent passes continue on that oblique line. The operator then returns to the vertical slit on the far right, and all subsequent suturing remains anchored on that vertical wound. Early attention centers on finalization at the lower end of the right‑most slit: the knot at this inferior segment is tightened and the suture tail is trimmed. The left hand cycles between the needle driver and scissors, while the right hand maintains light tension on the free end to the right; the scissors are kept parallel to the wound to give a flush cut. In this phase, no forceps are used to control tissue; instead, the operator relies on instrument positioning and thread tension to guard the knot as it is trimmed.

With the inferior tail trimmed, the operator builds the closure upward. Working again over the right‑most vertical slit, both hands come into play: one hand on the needle driver, the other on forceps. The pickups gently evert and lift a wound edge while the driver presents the needle perpendicular to the surface. The needle is grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body—an efficient position for controlled wrist rotation through the dermal edge. The pass is placed orthogonally across the slit, the needle is retrieved on the far side, and the suture is drawn through. At this point the right hand alternates between forceps and thread management, moving the free limb laterally and inferiorly to keep the working field clear. This alternating pattern—forceps for precise edge control during entry and exit, then thread management to clear slack—becomes a hallmark of the technique.

A sequence of setup and placement cycles follows. The driver is often held in the left hand, centered over the slit’s mid‑to‑upper portion, while the right hand manages the thread to the far right of the pad. The needle is repeatedly positioned perpendicular to the skin’s surface, occasionally oblique for fine alignment, then advanced across the wound in an arcing motion. Some segments show the operator preparing the next pass—hovering the needle tip just lateral to the intended entry point while the other hand tensions the free end—without actually penetrating the tissue. These preparatory moments are interspersed with frames where a full pass is taken and the suture is drawn through, indicating a deliberate, measured pace with attention to bite symmetry and spacing.

At intervals, forceps are used to evert the edges and present tissue to the needle, ensuring entry several millimeters from the wound margin with a perpendicular trajectory to avoid inward rolling of the dermis. At other times, especially when forceps are out of frame, the operator achieves acceptable edge approximation by relying on the needle’s curvature, driver supination, and carefully directed traction on the thread. The practice is consistent: aim for small, symmetric bites across the incision line and maintain perpendicular passage for even approximation.

Midway through the procedure, the pattern becomes clearly sequential along the right‑most slit. The driver, typically in the right hand in these passages, crosses the incision line while the left hand alternately holds forceps for counter‑traction and the free suture limb for slack control. The driver loads the needle two‑thirds from the tip to maximize control and leverage. After each pass, the operator re‑grasps near the swage to deliver the needle through smoothly, then re‑loads the needle back toward the mid‑body for the next entry. As this cycle repeats, the operator advances along the wound, at times described as moving inferiorly, at times concentrating again near the superior portion; practically, the surgeon appears to work within a defined segment, securing one stitch and then adjusting position to fill the next gap, occasionally revisiting the previous zone to optimize spacing and edge height.

Knot tying is conducted with instrument ties. After a pass and pull‑through, the needle is safely parked to the right, with the driver grasping the suture near the needle‑suture junction to maintain control and prevent needle drift. The assisting hand, positioned low and to the left of the wound, forms loops and alternates pull direction to square each throw. Successive throws are laid and seated with firm, controlled tension across the incision axis, drawing the wound edges together without strangulation. When forceps are available during tying, the operator may briefly lift an edge or gently press adjacent to the bite to seat the knot flush, but most of the tying is accomplished with the driver and thread alone. Completed knots are cinched directly over the wound, and the free ends are oriented to the right side of the pad.

Throughout, spatial discipline is maintained. Instruments not in use—scissors and occasional pickups—are parked to the left side of the field, avoiding clutter over the working line. The suture strand is deliberately managed to the right, so that it does not obscure the needle’s path or snag on other instruments. The driver tip remains centered over the right‑most incision, and the assistant hand, whether managing forceps or the thread, stays lateral and slightly inferior to the wound, yielding clear visualization. Even when the operator’s head intermittently obscures the camera’s view, the returned positioning shows the same consistent triangulation of driver, forceps (when used), and suture alignment across the targeted wound segment.

As the series of interrupted stitches accumulates, the mid‑portion of the right‑most slit shows clear approximation. Several evenly spaced knots dot the line, the edges meeting without significant gapping. In one interval, work concentrates at the superior end of the slit, where a new bite is initiated just above the previous stitches; the driver follows the curvature of the needle with a supinating motion, and the right hand pulls the suture through afterward. In another, the operator positions the needle to enter from the right edge toward the left, slightly above the clustered midline stitches, but pauses to reload for a better angle rather than forcing the pass—indicative of attention to bite orientation and depth.

The workflow alternates predictably between three phases: setup and positioning (hovering the needle tip and controlling the free limb), passage (a perpendicular arcing drive with re‑grasp near the swage), and security (instrument ties laid squarely and seated). During tying phases, the hands come closer together over the wound; during positioning, they separate—driver centered over the target bite, the other hand lateral and inferior, managing line tension to keep the field open. There are moments when forceps are not used for eversion; in those frames, the operator relies on the mechanical eversion imparted by the needle path and tension. While this can suffice on a training pad, it is noted as a minor deficiency compared to consistently lifting the dermal edge with pickups for every pass.

In the latter third of the procedure, prior stitches are clearly visible along the lateral half of the slit. The operator keeps the needle loaded at mid‑body or just proximal to mid‑body, making small adjustments to the angle before each entry. The thread is organized on the right side; slack is cleared with smooth, deliberate pulls that avoid jerking on the tissue. When tying a new interrupted stitch near the superior end, multiple instrument‑tie throws are created and seated sequentially. The free end is occasionally transferred to the hand that had been holding forceps earlier, underscoring the operator’s facility with alternating roles depending on the phase of the step.

As closure nears completion, there is a sequence of tensioning and strand organization rather than new needle passes. The needle driver is even used briefly to sweep or guide the suture line and to check how each knot lies against the skin surface. The non‑dominant hand steadies the pad’s right border while the dominant hand lightly presses adjacent to the closed bites—this finger pressure flattens the pad to visualize apposition and ensure that knots are not standing up or causing tissue inversion. Scissors rest off to the left, ready for trimming, and one earlier trim at the lower end has already been performed. In the final moments, the right hand returns to the knot area and suture tails, making small adjustments to tension and alignment; both hands then withdraw, leaving the line in a neat state with tails short and knots seated.

Across the entire effort, even with short intervals of limited visualization and a single early detour to an oblique training cut, the technique remains consistent with a methodical series of simple interrupted closures on the far‑right vertical slit. Each stitch is prepared with attention to perpendicular needle orientation, placed with small, symmetric bites, and secured using instrument ties that are squared by alternating traction. Forceps are used intermittently to evert and stabilize the wound edges; when not used, the operator compensates with needle angle and thread tension to maintain edge alignment. The spatial choreography stays disciplined: instruments parked away from the working line, driver centered over the bite, and the free limb swept to the right to keep the view open.

By the end of the sequence, the right‑most vertical incision shows multiple completed interrupted stitches along its central and upper segments, with the edges approximated evenly and without obvious gapping. The central portion particularly demonstrates good coaptation, and the superior portion has been filled in with additional passes and ties. The lower end is secure, as evidenced by the early trim; mid‑sequence adjustments confirm that knots are seated and tails are managed. While a few passes were only set up without penetration, and there are frames where forceps were not employed for eversion, the overall closure is coherent and effective for the selected technique. The final field shows the needle stowed, instruments lateral to the working area, and the wound edges brought together by several neatly tied interrupted stitches, the suture tails short and the line organized, reflecting a controlled and completed closure on the chosen vertical slit.
