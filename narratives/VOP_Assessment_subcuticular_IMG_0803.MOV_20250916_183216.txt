Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
This is a competent continuous subcuticular closure of the left vertical incision from inferior to superior, demonstrating consistent intradermal bite placement, symmetric opposing entries/exits, and effective edge eversion. Plane integrity is maintained with no mid‑run surface breaches, and the line coapts the skin with mild, uniform puckering and appropriate tension. Deficiencies are chiefly at the finish and in small elements of efficiency. The terminal tie is externalized rather than buried, which diminishes security and cosmetic advantage for a subcuticular and should be addressed with a buried start/finish or alternative securement strategy. Minor workflow drift and extra loop handling at the apex should be eliminated. Tighten the standard by burying both ends with square, well‑counted throws, maintain the same low‑profile economy through the termination, and you will have a high‑level, durable intracuticular result suitable for demanding clinical settings.
