Summative assessment:
Your instrument opposition and respect for tissue were competent: the needle was loaded reliably, entries were near perpendicular, and you used the needleâ€™s curve rather than pushing. The corner stitch achieved appropriate approximation with slight eversion and a knot that appeared to lie flat.
