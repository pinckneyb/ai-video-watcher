COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence opens with a quiet setup. A synthetic skin pad showing three parallel vertical incisions is centered on a wooden backboard. No instruments are yet engaged and none of the wounds are manipulated as a gloved hand places a label near the pad. This establishes the field and orientation before suturing begins.

Work then starts at the central incision and stays on this same midline wound throughout. The first activity develops at the superior third of this central cut. The needle driver approaches from above while forceps come in at the right wound edge to evert and expose the dermis. The needle is already swaged to the suture and loaded in the driver along the proximal-to-mid third of its curvature, with the tip aligned perpendicular to the skin. The positioning and tissue presentation indicate the start of a first bite near the top of the wound.

With the initial passage already completed by the time the next sequence begins, the focus turns to securing that first stitch. The needle is parked in the holder while instrument ties are formed over the superior edge of the incision. The left hand, acting as the post with the needle holder, and the right hand, manipulating the free end, alternate through multiple throws. The driver maintains a stable axis perpendicular to the incision as the knot is seated snugly without blanching the skin edges. When the knot is secure, scissors enter from the left to trim the tails. Care is taken to cut near the knot without inadvertently cutting the loop or loosening the throws. This completes the first secure knot at the apex, with edges approximated and the knot positioned squarely over the line.

After this opening stitch is secured and trimmed, the team prepares to move inferiorly. The right hand elevates and everts the right edge of the central wound with fine pickups at the mid–upper segment. The left hand advances the needle driver in line with the incision, holding the needle at about the proximal third to mid-shaft and oriented perpendicular to the skin. Initially aligned to enter the right edge, the plan is clearly to take a symmetric dermal bite on both sides. As work continues, the hands are repositioned for optimal exposure; whether entering from the right or left first, the principle remains constant—maintain perpendicular orientation, follow the needle’s curve, and match depth and distance from the margin on both sides. In this pass, the needle arcs cleanly through the near edge and across the gap to exit the far side under forceps control, which ensures eversion and protects the tissue from tearing. The suture is drawn through, leaving a short end for tying.

With the next stitch in place, instrument ties are again performed over the top of the wound. The needle remains attached but parked to the side, and the needle holder grasps the standing strand to perform the throws. The right hand acts on the free end to direct loop formation and tension. Each throw is cinched down carefully to bring the edges into apposition without crushing the tissue. Once secured, the scissors return from the left to trim the tails. This establishes a pattern for the case: each stitch is placed with consistent spacing and bite width to mirror the previous one, then tied with instrument throws and trimmed, before proceeding to the next point inferiorly.

Progress continues down the incision. The left hand holds the needle driver approaching from the top/left of the field, while the right hand with forceps stabilizes the lower third of the same central wound, typically on the operator’s right side. The curved needle is grasped approximately two-thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin surface. The driver pronates to follow the arc as the needle enters one edge, crosses the gap, and exits the opposite edge at a matching distance from the margin. The assistant everts each edge at the bite points to maintain proper edge alignment. The suture is pulled through and the strand is managed so that the free tail lies comfortably to the side, clear of the wound, ready for tying. The needle is then regripped or parked as needed, and instrument ties are laid down centrally over the incision, forming secure, even knot stacks aligned with the previously placed stitch. Scissors follow to trim the tails close to the knot.

For a time, the right hand predominantly controls the needle driver while the left hand brings in scissors to trim after tying. The needle is often held near the proximal third, kept perpendicular to the incision when in use, and then “parked” safely while knot tying and trimming are carried out. When the wound edges are approximated by the recent stitch, the driver’s tip hovers above the midline as instrument throws are completed to finalize the knot. The left hand crosses from the upper left to cut the tails near the knot, avoiding slipping or over-cutting. The movements remain tightly constrained over the midline closure; the lateral parallel incisions are left undisturbed throughout.

As closure advances to the mid-portion of the central slit, the technique remains consistent. The left hand, now frequently the primary driver hand, centers the needle holder over the target segment. The right hand with forceps tent and evert the edge opposite the driver’s entry to present tissue and to guide the arc. The needle is grasped at the proximal third and oriented perpendicular; the driver supinates or pronates as needed to deliver a smooth, controlled passage. After exit, the needle is regripped to pull the strand through cleanly without sawing the tissue. Each bite is sized to complement the adjacent stitches, ensuring even spacing and symmetric depth. Tension is applied carefully to snug the suture down, and then instrument ties are formed in sequence. The knot is seated directly over the midline; care is taken not to drag it off to one side, preserving even compression across both edges. Each set of tails is cut as the surgeon clears the field for the next placement.

Moving into the lower third, several passes are placed in succession. The right wound edge is lifted with the forceps and the needle is driven through in an even arc, transitioning across the gap to the left side. The free suture end is managed so as not to entangle with the needle, often trailing toward the lower or lateral aspect of the field. Knot tying follows with instrument throws, and scissors trim the ends. At times, the needle is reloaded between throws or after passage to optimize driver control; otherwise, it remains parked in the holder during tying and trimming. The wound remains well everted by the forceps during entry and exit, and the bites are placed close to the wound edge with consistent depth that mirrors the earlier stitches. In one segment, a slight gapping is noted near the superior end; this does not alter the approach, and subsequent stitches continue with the same method, maintaining the selected closure technique.

As the team works toward the inferior portion, a stitch is driven starting at the left edge and advanced across to the right. The assistant’s forceps alternate between sides to stabilize tissue at both the entry and exit points. The needle driver remains perpendicular to the skin with each pass, confirming proper technique and minimizing tearing or oblique tracking. With the suture drawn through, the line is tightened just enough to bring the edges flush with gentle eversion. Instrument ties are then formed; loop direction and tension are alternated to produce a secure, flat knot that sits over the incision rather than intruding into the wound edges. Once tied, scissors cross in to cut the tails. The hands withdraw briefly, leaving a neat knot stack aligned with the others.

In the subsequent pass near the lower midline gap, the driver is loaded around the mid-curve and directed from the right edge toward the left with a smooth rotation. The forceps remain just lateral to the edge being pierced, controlling the entry point and helping protect fingers from the needle. The suture arcs superiorly above the field as the material is advanced, and then both hands separate to tension the strand and maintain clarity over the wound. The stitch is tied and the tails are prepared for trimming, reinforcing the disciplined cadence: place, cinch, tie, trim. The driver, scissors, and forceps move in concert, staying close to the incision and avoiding excursions to the lateral, unused cuts.

A brief interlude follows in which no new bites are taken; the driver holds the needle while the opposing hand trims the newly tied knot’s tails. The instruments then withdraw. The central incision already shows multiple interrupted knots in its upper and middle portions, and attention returns to the remaining inferior gap for the next placement.

The inferior end receives particular focus. The needle holder works from above and slightly to the left of midline, while the forceps approach from below-right. The needle is grasped at the proximal third and driven in a controlled arc from the right edge across to the left, precisely at the apex of the residual opening. The assistant picks the edge to evert and present the correct bite depth, then crosses to the opposite side to support the needle’s exit. Once through, the suture loop is drawn and instrument ties are formed with the needle holder now serving as the tying instrument. The knot seats centrally, closing the apex neatly, with a trailing strand extending laterally while the scissors prepare to cut.

Work proceeds with another stitch in the lower third, again demonstrating stable, repeatable technique. The needle driver stays just left of midline as needed, crossing to the right as the passage completes. The right hand uses forceps to stabilize the wound lips during the needle’s entry and exit. After passage, multiple throws are completed, the knot is cinched down against the wound, and the suture ends are trimmed. All knot stacks appear evenly spaced and centered, matching the style of those in the superior and central segments.

The final frames focus on completing and cleaning up the last stitch at the lower-mid portion. The right hand controls the free suture strand exiting the most recent knot while the needle, still clamped in the needle holder, is parked just lateral to the wound. The left hand brings scissors in from the upper left, cutting the tails neatly at an appropriate length to discourage unraveling without leaving excessive material. During trimming, the operator keeps slight tension on the tail to avoid loosening the knot. After cutting, both hands withdraw. The closure line remains intact and neatly aligned.

Throughout the procedure, the fundamental elements of the selected technique are consistent and clear:

- One incision is addressed from start to finish: the central, vertical midline slit on the pad. The left and right parallel incisions are never manipulated.

- Sutures are placed as discrete passes spaced along the length of the wound, proceeding in an orderly fashion from the superior third into the middle and then the lower portions, ultimately closing the inferior gap. Each stitch is planned with attention to equal bite width and depth on both sides and is seated with the knot centered over the incision.

- Tissue handling emphasizes gentle eversion with forceps, never crushing the dermal margins. Forceps are used to tent the edge just enough for the needle to engage the dermis at the desired depth while keeping fingertips out of the needle path.

- Needle handling is meticulous. The needle is grasped at the proximal third to mid-curve to maintain control and is consistently oriented perpendicular to the skin surface. The driver rotates to follow the needle’s arc through the near and far edges, and the needle is regripped as needed after exit to pull through smoothly. When not actively passing, the needle is parked in the holder to avoid errant movement and suture entanglement during ties and trimming.

- Knot tying relies on instrument ties. The needle driver frequently acts as the post, and the opposing hand manipulates the free end to lay throws in alternating directions. Tension is applied deliberately to seat each knot without excessive compression of the tissue. After securing the knot, scissors enter—often from the left—crossing the field to cut the tails near the knot while the other hand stabilizes the suture.

- Ergonomics and hand roles adapt fluidly. At times the left hand is the primary driver with the right hand on forceps; at other moments the right hand holds the driver. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument, the opposing positions are maintained across the incision to preserve visualization and safety: one instrument per side during passage, then central alignment during tying.

- Spatial discipline is maintained. All activity stays centered over the midline incision. Instrument tips remain a few millimeters from the wound edges, and movements purposefully cross the incision only when needed for needle passage or tying. The suture strands are managed so they trail laterally and inferiorly away from the field, minimizing clutter over the wound.

By the end of the sequence, the vertical midline incision is closed along its length with a series of evenly spaced, secure interrupted knots. The edges are well approximated with mild eversion, and the knot stacks are centered over the line without undue tightness or tissue strangulation. The inferior apex, initially open, has been closed with a carefully placed and tied stitch. Final trimming leaves neat, short tails. No additional manipulations are performed on the lateral incisions at any point, preserving the singular focus on the central wound. The field is left tidy, with the suture line intact and consistent from top to bottom, reflecting a methodical, well-executed closure.
