============================================================
Opening and setup (0–44 s)
The sequence opens on a synthetic skin pad mounted to a board. The surgeon works bimanually: needle driver in the left hand, Adson forceps in the right. The first movements establish sound fundamentals—needle loaded on the body about two-thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin, with the right-hand forceps everting and stabilizing the near/right wound edge of the central incision. The driver advances the curved needle through the dermis, releasing and re-grasping as needed to follow its arc. The right hand briefly takes the needle near the tip for controlled exit, then presents it back to the driver. Suture is drawn through smoothly, with the strand kept arced away from the field to avoid snagging.

Early passes and controlled retrieval (45–119 s)
With the rhythm set, the operator continues to drive and retrieve through the right edge. Forceps lift and evert the margin; the needle exits close to the edge in shallow, symmetric bites. Each pass is completed by releasing and regripping the needle on its body rather than pulling by the tip, preserving needle integrity and tissue. The suture loop is managed carefully—kept superior/inferior to the wound, away from instrument tips. Through 75–104 s and 105–119 s, this pattern repeats: the needle is reloaded at mid‑body with a perpendicular approach, the forceps briefly control the emerging tip, and the suture is pulled through to shorten the free end. No knots are tied yet; the focus is on precise, superficial dermal passes and maintaining edge eversion without crushing.

Transition to tying at the corner (120–134 s)
After withdrawing the needle from the left side near the superior corner, the surgeon transitions from driving to tying. The needle remains clamped in the driver while the right-hand forceps control the short end at the entry site. The driver begins forming loops over the strand—classic instrument-tie setup—while the wound edges are gently approximated. Between these frames and the preceding passes, the complementary bite through the opposite edge would have been completed to create a full interrupted stitch ready for knot securement.

Refined passage and retrieval on a neighboring segment (135–164 s)
Attention shifts to an adjacent segment of the incision. The technique remains consistent: needle grasped at the proximal third, perpendicular entry, and forceps-assisted control of the tip as it exits. Bites are a few millimeters from the margin, producing slight eversion without trauma. The needle is regrasped mid‑arc to complete extraction, then reloaded for the next pass. At 150–164 s the right-hand forceps guide and then regrasp the needle body for efficient reloading, streamlining the hand-to-hand flow.

Repositioning and setup for the next bite (165–179 s)
There is a brief pause for orientation and planning. The driver supinates/pronates to align the needle perpendicular to the next target along the central/right incision. The forceps preview the bite by lifting the near edge but do not permit penetration yet. This interlude shows deliberate angle setting, ensuring the needle’s curve will traverse the dermal plane cleanly.

Driving through the opposite edge and completing the pass (180–209 s)
Penetration resumes: the left hand drives the needle through the right edge of the central incision; the tip appears within the wound, and the right-hand forceps seize it to complete exit. The driver releases and regrips the body to finish the arc and draw the suture through. In the following frames, the forceps switch to the opposite (left) edge, gently everting it as the driver readies to enter that side. Reloads occur at the junction of the proximal/middle third of the needle, preserving perpendicular orientation and bite symmetry. Slack is kept clear of adjacent incisions to maintain a tidy field.

Reloading and strand control without new penetration (210–224 s)
Now the emphasis is on regrasping and stabilizing the needle and strand. The driver finds a firm hold near mid‑body while the forceps assist near the swage. The needle is oriented mostly parallel/oblique during reloads as the team prepares for the next precise approach. This is a setup interval—no tissue passes are made, and attention remains on safe instrument choreography and strand management.

Bite at the superior end and initiation of a throw (225–239 s)
At the superior end of the wound, a controlled bite is taken with the driver near-perpendicular to the skin. The non-dominant hand everts the edge with toothed forceps, the needle is advanced, and the loop is drawn up and away from the incision. As the suture is brought through, instrument tying begins—an initial throw is formed with the driver capturing the short end while the opposite hand tensions the long strand. The edges approximate gently without undue tension.

Driving the near/left edge and setting up to tie (240–254 s)
A focused pass engages only the left wound margin. The driver enters near-perpendicular, then re-grips near the tip to bring the needle out through the epidermis. The needle is repositioned on the body for control while keeping the suture free and untangled. The opposite edge is not penetrated in this snippet, suggesting the complementary pass preceded or follows immediately off-frame before tying.

Instrument tie: securing the stitch (255–299 s)
With a bite in place, the sequence turns to knot tying. The right hand holds forceps early to control the free end, then yields as the left-hand driver performs an instrument tie: wraps are made over the driver’s tip, the short end is grasped, and opposing traction seats the first throw. Subsequent frames show alternating wrap directions—consistent with forming a square knot—and then additional throws for security. The driver alone manipulates the loop in stretches, indicating comfort and economy of motion. The knot cinches down at the left/superior corner without crossing the incision, approximating the edges evenly.

Needle reorientation for the next stitch (300–314 s)
After securing a knot, attention returns to the needle. The driver initially holds near the swage, then the right-hand forceps enter to fine-tune orientation on the needle body near the tip. Together they bring the needle to a perpendicular stance poised for the next bite along an adjacent incision. No tissue is pierced here; this is pure setup to maintain clean geometry for the next pass.

Final cinch and hands clear (315–329 s)
A brief revisit to the just-tied knot: the right-hand forceps stabilize the edge momentarily while the driver manipulates the suture loop to snug the throw definitively. No new needle passes are made; the needle remains out of tissue while the knot is dressed. The driver re-enters once more to check lay and tension near the knot, then both hands withdraw, leaving a neatly seated throw.

Closing actions and positioning (330–339 s)
In the final moments, the right hand appears briefly to stabilize the pad. The needle driver approaches from the superior-left to regrasp the needle on its body, tip oriented toward the incision, preparing for a subsequent stitch. No penetration occurs; the scene closes with the needle controlled and aligned, the field tidy, and the prior sutures approximating the central wound.

Flow, technique, and evolution
Across the sequence, the surgeon maintains a disciplined rhythm: perpendicular entries, small dermal bites 2–3 mm from the edge, and consistent use of forceps to evert and protect tissue during exit. Needle handling matures from frequent releases and regrips to smoother, anticipatory reloads with the forceps assisting only as needed. Strand management is deliberate—loops are kept lateral/superior and off the wound to prevent entanglement, and during tying the driver and the assistant hand create opposing, linear traction to seat square knots without sawing. The overall cadence alternates between precise driving phases and calm setup intervals, culminating in clean instrument ties that approximate the wound edges without crush or excess tension, and efficient reorientation for the next stitch.
