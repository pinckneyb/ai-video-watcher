Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
The sequence shows a controlled, methodical approach with stable hand positioning and clear opposition between driver and Adsons. Needle control is competent—grasped at the distal third with smooth arcs and right-angle entries/exits—producing symmetric bites and consistent tissue purchase. The corner stitch was executed cleanly with a square knot and appropriate tension, yielding slight eversion.
