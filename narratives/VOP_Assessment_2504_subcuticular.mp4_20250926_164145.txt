COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single vertical repair on the right‑central portion of the practice skin pad — a cranio‑caudal wound that is the focus of the entire video. From the first frames through the end, the operator works exclusively along this single incision line, progressively placing, tensioning and securing a series of individual skin stitches to restore epidermal and dermal apposition.

Initial field and baseline (0.0–44.0 s)
At the outset the wound already bears an established column of evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures running cranio‑caudal along the right‑central slit. In the earliest frames the wound edges sit nearly perfectly opposed with minimal gapping, the stitch row showing regular spacing and slight, expected eversion from knot tension. No hands or instruments are visible in some early frames; the only active visual cue is a loose suture tail and a curved needle lying at the superior (cranial) end of the stitch line, external to the tissue. These frames convey that most of the line has already been closed and that the operator is preparing to complete the outstanding superior bites or secure the final knot. Where instruments are absent the scene is static — stitches are tied and trimmed, but the needle is not being manipulated; this intermittent absence of hands is noted as a limitation in direct observation but does not change the continuity of the single repair line.

Initiation of active work and needle management (45.0–104.0 s)
Shortly after the initial static period the operator returns and activity resumes at the cranial end. Both hands appear in coordinated opposition: one hand holding fine toothed forceps to present and evert the near wound edge, and the other controlling a needle driver containing a curved suture needle. The needle is typically grasped a few millimetres from the swage or near the mid‑shaft rather than at the tip, allowing controlled rotation of the curve through dermal tissue. Needle trajectory is deliberate and conservative — short, perpendicular-to-oblique bites are taken through the epidermal/subepidermal layers to capture dermis without excess bulk. The non‑dominant hand intermittently pins the opposite edge with Adson‑type forceps, elevating tissue to provide purchase for the needle and to produce the slight everted apposition seen across the line. During this period passes are short, instrument-to-tissue distances are small (hands typically 1–3 cm above the wound), and the motions are repetitive and precise, consistent with conventional simple interrupted technique.

Progression along the line — inferior to superior passes and completion of midline bites (105.0–224.0 s)
As the sequence continues, the operator moves along the same cranio‑caudal axis, completing remaining bites and reinforcing the line. The hands repeatedly adopt the same pattern: one instrument presenting tissue and providing counter‑traction while the other advances the curved needle through the opposing edge; instruments converge at narrow angles (often ~30–60°) to meet directly over the wound. Needle passes are controlled, typically taken perpendicular to the skin surface and guided through the superficial‑to‑mid dermis of the synthetic pad; the operator takes small, even bites producing regular spacing and a uniform tension across the line. There are intermittent frames documenting knot formation steps — the operator draws the suture through, forms loops and initiates instrument ties. Knotting alternates between instrument‑assisted throws (needle driver used to form and cinch throws) and brief moments where the operator uses bare gloved fingers to manipulate and tension the suture loop — especially when fine fingertip control is needed to align the epidermal margins and prevent inversion. During these steps the opposing hand either holds the tail or steadies tissue with fingertip pressure rather than continuing to grasp with forceps, illustrating a natural transition from needle passage to knot formation.

Variations in handling and occasional technique shifts (225.0–329.0 s)
Across the mid‑portion of the video the overall pattern remains individual interrupted bites, but a few subtle variations appear. In most passes the needle driver holds the needle mid‑shaft for precise control; in isolated frames the needle is grasped slightly closer to the swage for a more robust, slightly deeper bite. The operator consistently attempts to evert the edges slightly at each stitch to avoid inversion. There are also a small number of frames where the operator’s technique appears to adapt: in one sequence the operator uses a longer sweeping suture feed and repeated passes that have the visual characteristics of continuous progression — the suture tail spans across the pad and sequential bites are placed without obvious knotting between each pass. However, these are fleeting and brief; the dominant pattern before and after that interval is interrupted placement and individual knotting. Elsewhere a solitary stitch is described as looped/figure‑of‑eight/mattress style near the center of the line; this likely reflects the operator’s deliberate choice to place a slightly broader purchase at one location that needed more eversion or strength (for example across a small spot of tissue irregularity). This occasional use of a mattress/figure‑of‑eight style stitch sits as a local adaptation within the essentially interrupted repair strategy, intended to reinforce and flatten a challenging portion of the incision.

Hands and spatial choreography (330.0–404.0 s)
Throughout the active phase the hands maintain a consistent spatial choreography relative to the wound: they operate in a compact, shared workspace immediately above the incision. Typically the dominant hand (frequently entering from the viewer’s left or superior quadrant) holds the needle driver and performs needle passes and instrument ties; the non‑dominant hand (entering from the opposite side) holds toothed forceps which evert and present the dermis. The two instruments often cross momentarily during needle extraction and knot manipulation; their tips are consistently within 1–3 cm of each other above the wound, enabling rapid, coordinated motions. Where cutdown or trimming is required the non‑dominant hand briefly swaps forceps for small scissors and performs suture tail trimming after final throws are secured. Multiple frames show the operator alternating which hand provides tissue tension and which drives the needle — this interchangeability allows the operator to approach bites from slightly different angles as needed (superior vs inferior approaches) while preserving tight control of the margins.

Knotting technique and tactile manipulation (405.0–494.0 s)
As the repair converges toward completion, knot tying becomes the principal activity. The operator alternates between instrument ties (needle driver and hemostat use to complete throws) and hand‑assisted ties (fingertip looping and cinching). In several frames the needle itself is no longer visible and the operator is clearly working with the free suture — forming a loop with one hand while the other provides counter‑tension at the knot site. This tactile phase demonstrates careful attention to suture security and edge apposition; the operator uses fingertip pressure on the wound to ensure the knot is snug without strangulating the tissue. In situations where better suture control is needed for the end throws, the operator transitions to bare gloved finger manipulation to achieve the necessary subtlety. When finalizing stitches, suture tails are elevated away from the wound and trimmed with small scissors in a coordinated sequence so that no excess tail lies across the incision.

Late refinements and final passes (495.0–537.0 s)
The final recorded activity focuses on resolving the remaining proximal stitches at the superior end of the right‑central line. Instrument and hand positioning remain familiar — one hand tensions and aligns the superior margin while the other passes the needle and completes final knots. In isolated late frames the operator places a reinforced bite (described as a looped/figure‑of‑eight type stitch) near the center of the line, then completes its knot and trims the tail. At moments the operator works bare‑handed, using fingertips to form and tighten loops rather than instruments; elsewhere a small needle driver is reintroduced to retrieve/handle the needle tip for the last passages. The operator trims suture tails cleanly and removes instruments from the field as the line becomes uniformly approximated.

Tissue handling and wound appearance throughout
Across the sequence the synthetic dermal tissue is consistently handled gently. Bites are superficial to mid‑dermal, avoiding excessive deep purchase that could bunch tissue. The forceps reliably present and everts the margin to achieve slight outward rotation of the wound edges — a deliberate technique to produce epidermal apposition at skin level. Tension across stitches is moderate and evenly distributed; completed knots create slight, uniform eversion without tissue puckering or ischemic blanching. At no point is there evidence of aggressive undermining, deep layer closure, or traction that would distort the alignment. When small irregularities or deeper pockets are encountered along the slit, the operator selectively augments with a broader mattress/figure‑of‑eight stitch rather than changing the closure pattern wholesale.

Technique consistency and overall strategy
The overarching strategy across the entire recording is consistent: simple, precise interrupted skin sutures placed along a single vertical incision from one end to the other, with local adaptations used sparingly when needed. Needles are handled with a standard needle‑driver grip near the body of the curve for fine control; passes are short and controlled, taking small dermal bites to obtain eversion and close approximation. Knotting alternates instrument‑assisted throws with fingertip manipulation as required for finer tension control. Occasional departures — a brief continuous‑style sweep or a mattress/looped stitch — are tactical choices to address localized tissue characteristics; they do not alter the fundamental interrupted closure plan. Periods where no instruments or hands are visible do not indicate a switch of the repair focus; they instead represent lulls between bites, repositioning, or off‑camera tightening/completion of knots.

Final appearance and closure state
At the end of the video the right‑central vertical slit is fully approximated along its length. The stitch line is continuous and regular, with each previously described short, interrupted bite placed to create a neat cranio‑caudal row. Edges lie in close apposition with minimal residual gapping; the epidermal margins are slightly everted from knot tension, a desirable sign for good surface approximation. Suture tails have been secured and trimmed where necessary; the operator has completed final tightening and cleanup. In aggregate the repair presents as a uniformly closed wound with stable, evenly tensioned interrupted sutures and a small localized reinforcement stitch where tissue condition warranted. Although some frames noted brief instrument absence or variation in knotting style, the procedure consistently returns to the same disciplined interrupted technique to produce a secure skin closure across the entire right‑central incision.
