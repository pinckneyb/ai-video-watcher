COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel vertical incisions. From the outset, the operator focuses exclusively on the rightmost incision—a straight, full-thickness slit with clean edges and visible sublayer. The left incision shows multiple previously placed interrupted sutures, and the central incision bears some puncture marks or isolated previous closures, but neither is engaged. All active work concentrates along the right-hand cut. The technique employed remains consistent with a simple interrupted closure, using a needle driver and tissue forceps throughout, with scissors appearing intermittently for trimming and occasional brief handoffs.

Initial approach and first pass (0–29 s)
The sequence opens with instruments converging over the rightmost incision’s lower to mid portion. The needle driver holds a curved needle about two-thirds from its tip, aligning it perpendicular to the wound edge—textbook orientation for controlled, even penetration. The assistant instrument, a fine pickup, stabilizes a wound margin and lightly everts it without crushing. The driver advances in a smooth arc toward the presented edge. The forceps oppose the driver across the gap, creating a tidy working triangle over the wound and guiding the needle’s trajectory to achieve a near-to-far passage that will mirror symmetrically on the opposite side. The suture thread trails across the field, slack carefully managed so it does not snag the neighboring incisions.

As this first bite is completed, the suture is drawn through, and the wound edges begin to approximate. The needle is regripped as needed to maintain the perpendicular angle and smooth rotation of the curve through tissue. By the end of this segment, the pass is complete and the operator prepares to secure it.

First knot and early suture management (30–44 s)
With the needle now out of tissue, the driver is used as a tying instrument. The opposite hand manages the free end, and the strand is wrapped and advanced into a series of throws. No forceps are used in this short tying sequence; the edges are stabilized by tension alone, already sitting nicely from the prior pass. The knot is seated with controlled lateral tension, keeping it centered over the incision line.

Establishing a rhythm of interrupted placement (45–104 s)
The next segment returns to setup for another stitch on the same right-hand wound. The needle is again clamped two-thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin, with the driver and forceps opposing each other across the incision. The forceps lift and evert the entry edge then cross to assist retrieval at the exit side—consistent, gentle tissue handling to avoid crushing and to maintain eversion. The driver advances the needle in a supinating motion, following the curve through the right lip and across to the opposite margin. Bites are kept close to the edge with even depth and spacing, aiming for symmetric entry and exit points.

Suture tension is managed thoughtfully: the free strand is draped across the field to avoid tangling, and slack is moved superiorly or laterally as needed. The needle is regripped on the needle body when required to correct angle and continue the arc cleanly. After passage, the strand is drawn through in a deliberate motion to avoid dragging the needle across the skin surface. Across these frames, the operator shows consistent mastery of opposing-hand choreography—driver on one side, forceps on the other—aligned across the slit to control entry, path, and exit.

Repositioning and controlled adjustments (105–149 s)
Work continues along the same rightmost incision, now moving along its mid-portion. The needle is loaded near the proximal third, then occasionally transferred or regripped to restore ideal perpendicular approach. The left and right hands swap roles at times—indicative of ambidextrous comfort and ergonomic adaptation to the incision’s orientation. Forceps continue to provide gentle eversion and stabilization at the entry point; after the tip emerges, the assistant instrument secures and hands off the needle to the driver for controlled retrieval. At points, this sequence shows setup and alignment without a full pass captured, yet the intent is clear: the operator methodically prepares each bite to match the prior ones, preserving edge-to-edge symmetry.

Driving and tying in sequence (150–179 s)
At this stage, another stitch is driven cleanly through the right wound edge with the needle oriented perpendicular to the skin. The pass is completed and the suture pulled through. Instrument ties begin, with the driver and assistant instrument crossing near mid-incision to facilitate throws and seat the knot. Throughout, the operator maintains consistent spacing and gentle tension, keeping knots snug without excessive tightening that could strangulate tissue. The assistant hand occasionally switches from forceps to an additional driver or scissors, reflecting the transition from passage to tying and then to trimming.

Measured progression with completed ties and trimming (180–224 s)
The next series shows preparation followed by a full pass, tie, and trim. The forceps stabilize the near edge to present the entry point; the driver advances the needle across the wound with a smooth rotational movement. Once through, the suture is drawn and the operator moves inferiorly to perform instrument ties. The free end is managed in the assistant hand while the driver lays sequential throws. After the knot is securely seated and centered over the incision line, scissors are used to trim the tails. The operator then reapproaches the wound at an adjacent segment to initiate the next stitch, re-establishing the familiar pattern: forceps lift and evert, needle is delivered perpendicular to the skin, and the pass proceeds across the gap.

Consistent, meticulous technique with deliberate edge eversion (225–269 s)
Another bite is initiated and advanced over the same right-hand incision. The driver may briefly regrip the needle to refine its angle before penetration. The left and right hands move in anti-parallel positions, forming a stable triangle over the incision. The forceps manage edge eversion—first at the entry side to present dermis for the needle tip, then at the far side to assist exit and protect tissue as the tip emerges. The suture strand is kept clear, trailing diagonally across the field or superiorly to avoid entanglement. As the pass completes, the operator transitions to tying. In these passages, the deliberate use of perpendicular needle orientation and symmetric bites continues to characterize the work, with the operator briskly moving between steps while maintaining precision.

Full cycle: pass, tie, trim, and move (240–269 s)
This segment demonstrates the entire cycle clearly. The driver rotates the needle through one margin and then the opposing margin, maintaining eversion with forceps at each edge. The strand is pulled through, the knot is formed with instrument ties, and then tails are trimmed, leaving a neat knot centrally located over the incision line. The instruments withdraw, then reapproach a small distance away along the same wound to continue closure. Prior stitches and tails are now visible near the right incision, documenting ongoing progress along this single line.

Further stitches with steady opposition and strand control (270–314 s)
The operator sets up the next bite with the driver working just medial to the right incision and forceps opposing at the lateral edge. The needle is again held around the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip and kept perpendicular to the surface. The forceps elevate the right wound edge to present the entry point, and the driver advances the needle in a controlled arc to achieve a matched exit on the far side. As the needle emerges, the assistant instrument helps capture and hand it back to the driver, facilitating a smooth suture pull-through.

Between passes, the right hand sometimes takes over strand management, pulling slack inferiorly or superiorly to prevent interference with the needle. When tying is captured, the needle holder lies idle and the operator’s primary focus is on the two suture ends: the short tail is held close to the wound, and the long end is wrapped and tightened with lateral motion to lock each throw in place. The knots are seated centrally and evenly, approximating the edges without inversion or excessive compression.

Preparation, tying, and continued closure up the line (315–344 s)
With several passes now completed, one sequence shows exclusively the tying phase, where the right hand works the long end and the left hand maintains tension on the short tail close to the wound. The throws are added deliberately, alternating to square the knot, and then the line returns to active needle passage. In the following passage, the curved needle is reloaded at the proximal third, reoriented perpendicular to the skin, and driven through one edge and across to the other. The assistant picks up the emerging tip, the tissue edges are gently drawn together, and the suture is prepared to be tied, keeping the line of closure straight and the eversion consistent.

Brief pause in passage (345–359 s)
A short segment shows instruments positioned over the right-side incision, aligned for the next bite, and then moving out of frame. No tissue is penetrated in these frames, suggesting a quick adjustment, reset, or momentary pause before resuming the sequence. The positioning is consistent with the same workflow: needle loaded at the proximal third, oriented across the incision; forceps aligned to present the edge and protect the exit.

Non-operative interlude on the left incision (360–366 s)
In the final brief frames, no hands are visible and the camera view includes the leftmost incision with previously placed sutures and loose strands. No manipulation occurs, and the needle is not visible. This appears to be a transient, non-operative interlude where the field of view shifted. It does not represent a change in the closure being performed. Throughout the actual operative sequences, all active tissue handling, needle passage, knot tying, and trimming occur on the rightmost incision.

Technique characteristics and evolution
Across the procedure, the technique remains consistent and purposeful:

- Needle handling: The needle is routinely grasped at the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, ensuring good control of the curve. The approach is perpendicular to the skin surface, enabling a predictable circular path through tissue and minimizing lateral tearing. When necessary, the driver regrips the needle to restore the perpendicular angle before entry or to advance after partial passage. Passage follows a supinating rotation rather than a straight push, preserving the needle’s curvature and reducing tissue trauma.

- Tissue handling: Forceps (Adson/rat-tooth or similar) are used judiciously to stabilize and evert the wound edges. The operator avoids crushing the edges, lifting only enough to present dermis for clean, symmetric bites. Eversion is maintained throughout entry and exit; the assistant instrument frequently transitions from presenting the entry edge to supporting the exit side and capturing the tip. The resulting approximation shows slight edge eversion, favorable for healing.

- Suture pathway and spacing: Each bite appears to mirror its counterpart across the gap, with similar depth and distance from the cut edge, aiming to achieve accurate realignment of the epidermal margins. The trajectory of the needle from near to far (and vice versa when repositioning) remains perpendicular, and the spacing is kept near-uniform along the length of the closure. Although not every knot or pass is captured in every sequence, the recurring cycle of pass, draw-through, tie, and trim shows a steady progression up the length of the rightmost incision.

- Instrument ties and knot management: The operator consistently ties with a needle driver, executing instrument ties with controlled wraps and alternating throws. The knots are seated laterally and then centered over the incision line without cinching excessively. Tails are trimmed cleanly, leaving short ends adjacent to the knot. During tying, one hand holds the short tail close to the wound, while the other hand manipulates the long strand to create and secure each throw. The suture strand is kept clear of the operative field between passes, usually draped superiorly or diagonally to avoid snagging.

- Hand position and ergonomics: The operator switches hands for the needle driver at times, an ambidextrous adjustment that maintains optimal wrist position and needle arc through varying segments of the incision. Typically, the driver operates just medial or lateral to the slit, with forceps opposing on the other margin to create a controlled, perpendicular pathway. The “working triangle” is a consistent feature: driver and forceps tips converge over the wound, with the suture strand trailing away from the field to reduce clutter. During tying, the hands move inferiorly or laterally to work the throws, then return to the wound to set and trim.

- Spatial discipline: Other incisions are left undisturbed; the left incision’s prior sutures and the central incision’s old marks remain outside the operative focus. Even as previously placed stitches accumulate on the rightmost slit, subsequent bites are carefully positioned to avoid snagging tails, and the strand is directed away from adjacent slits. When the camera briefly shows the left incision without active hands, no work is performed; this does not alter the consistent focus on the right incision throughout the closure.

Progress and final state
From the first pass onward, the rightmost incision steadily transforms from an open slit with visible sublayer to a progressively approximated wound with multiple neatly tied simple interrupted knots spaced along its length. Several full cycles—pass, draw-through, tie, trim—are clearly depicted. Between those cycles, preparatory frames show careful loading, alignment, edge presentation, and controlled entry angles. The operator’s method emphasizes edge eversion, perpendicular needle travel, symmetric bites, and secure, centered knots.

By the end of the captured sequences, the rightmost incision displays multiple completed interrupted sutures, with knots aligned over the wound and tails trimmed short. The edges are approximated evenly, with slight eversion and without visible crushing. While a final, explicit “last stitch” moment is not shown, the cumulative evidence demonstrates a coherent, uninterrupted progression of interrupted suture placement up the right-side incision, punctuated by appropriately executed instrument ties and careful suture management. The closure exhibits consistent technique, tidy knot placement, and orderly spacing, indicating a well-executed interrupted repair of the rightmost incision.
