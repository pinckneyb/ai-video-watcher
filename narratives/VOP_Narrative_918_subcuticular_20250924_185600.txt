COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with several marked cuts, but the operator’s attention remains on a single straight linear laceration that runs across the central portion of the field. At the outset, a separate, superior cut already shows a row of completed stitches and serves as a visual reference; this closed line stays out of play as the operator focuses on the open, central wound. Throughout the case the pad and camera perspective change, so this same working incision appears at times horizontal or vertical and may sit at different places in the frame (midline, upper, or lower relative to the camera), but the suturing continues along this one wound in a methodical, segment-by-segment fashion.

The opening sequence demonstrates the foundational approach. With the wound slightly gaping, the left hand holds the needle driver while the right hand uses fine tissue forceps to evert the edges and guide the needle. The curved needle is consistently gripped about one-third from the swaged end (or at the proximal third from the tip), which gives precise control over its arc. The driver is kept near-perpendicular to the skin surface, and the needle follows its curvature through the dermis with smooth wrist rotation. The right hand picks up each wound edge 3–5 mm from the margin to present the dermis, creating slight eversion as the needle enters one side and exits the other at a symmetric distance from the cut. The first stitch traverses the near edge, then the far edge; the suture is pulled through to leave an adequate tail for tying. Early knots are sometimes initiated immediately after passage; at other times, the stitch is placed and the suture positioned for tying in the subsequent moments. As the needle is delivered through both sides, the driver is briefly regrasped mid-arc to maintain a safe, perpendicular bite and preserve the needle’s curve.

Once the first stitch is seated, the operator proceeds along the wound with an orderly rhythm. When a previously placed stitch is present at the central incision, the next pass is initiated just adjacent to it. The left hand continues to control the needle driver while the right hand elevates the wound edge with Adsons or fingertips to aid visualization. The needle is again oriented at a right angle to the skin surface and driven with a forehand stroke across the incision. Symmetric bite depth and spacing are prioritized, and the needle tip is regripped as needed for a controlled exit on the far side. Where tying is shown, the operator performs instrument ties, squaring loops over the incision and seating the knot centrally, then managing the free end and trimming tails if the sequence includes cutting. Where tying is not shown, the suture is managed to maintain a long free limb for later knot construction.

As the sequence continues across the midline, the operator maintains these principles. The needle is routinely reloaded two-thirds from the tip or at the proximal third from the swage to preserve an optimal lever arm. The left forceps lift the near side to provide counter-traction during entry, then shift to the far side during exit. At times, the right hand will guide the needle tip itself to facilitate a safe hand-off before the driver takes over again. The bites remain a few millimeters from the cut edge and of matched depth through the dermis, supporting edge eversion and clean approximation. When knot tying occurs immediately after passage, multiple instrument throws are performed with steady, parallel tension to the wound axis to avoid tilting the knot across the incision. Knots are seated on the surface over the incision line or slightly off the midline depending on the operator’s preference and strand control, and the tails are trimmed with scissors once secure.

There are segments where the operator proceeds through passage without immediately tying, instead preparing the field and ensuring the suture tail and long limb are properly oriented. In those moments, the instruments often hover a few millimeters off the pad; the driver remains open or partly closed while the needle is reloaded to ensure a perpendicular approach on the next bite. This is particularly evident when the camera shows the line positioned at the top of the field: the driver hovers lateral-inferior to the wound while the needle and thread lie to the side, indicating a deliberate pause to reestablish the bite angle and hand positions.

Progression down the line is deliberate and consistent. After the first stitches in the central portion, the operator initiates another pass along the same wound, again using the left hand to hold the driver and the right to stabilize tissue with forceps. The needle enters the near edge, exits the far edge, and the suture is drawn through. On several passes, after crossing both edges the operator moves directly into tying, forming sequential instrument throws and drawing the knot down over the approximated edges. Tension is applied just enough to coapt the epidermal margins without blanching or strangulation. The tail is sometimes cut immediately; in other frames, the clasping hand shifts to manage the next pass. The field remains tidy; the free limb is kept lateral and superior or inferior to the working zone to reduce tangling, and the driver and forceps consistently bracket the wound.

At times the driver is moved to the right hand and the forceps to the left, depending on the direction of travel along the incision and the camera’s orientation. This role alternation preserves a comfortable forehand stroke that keeps the needle perpendicular to the skin and minimizes torque on the tissues. In one mid-sequence stretch, the right hand drives the needle through the far/right edge, then across to the near/left edge, with the left forceps lifting each dermal margin in turn. The stitch is then secured with instrument ties, the knot is squared centrally, and the suture tails are prepared for trimming. This switch of dominant hand mirrors the earlier left-hand driver posture but upholds the same bite quality and knot control.

As closure continues into adjacent segments, both hands maintain short working distances from the wound. The driver enters at roughly 90 degrees to the skin, and the forceps are held at a shallow angle to evert the edge without crushing. The operator is careful not to undermine or spread the tissue excessively; instead, gentle elevation of the dermis facilitates a precise entry point. Bites on the near and far sides are balanced, and the wound edges meet neatly as traction is applied to the suture to bring them together before knot seating.

In the middle portion of the sequence the wound appears rotated relative to the camera and the suture line is oriented vertically, but the technique and local landmarks confirm continued work on the same cut. A cluster of completed stitches is visible in what is now the upper portion of the frame, and fresh stitches are placed just below them. Here, the right hand often holds the needle driver with the left using forceps to lift the dermis; the needle again is grasped at the proximal third and driven perpendicularly across the wound. After the pass, the suture is drawn through, instrument ties are formed, and the knot is seated over the wound before trimming. As these stitches accumulate, the operator advances downward along the same line, repeating the cycle of bite, passage, approximation, tying, and trimming.

Moments of instrument preparation recur between stitches, particularly around transitions between wound segments. The camera shows the driver open and hovering while the needle and strand rest lateral to the wound; then the operator reloads the needle to set up a clean right-to-left pass. These pauses underscore attention to needle orientation and preservation of a forehand arc, even as the wound’s apparent orientation and position in the frame shift.

At one point, the operator refines a stitch at the wound’s lateral end. The tissue is steadied with pickups near the edge, and a bite is taken close to the corner to capture the tip accurately while maintaining eversion. The curved needle is advanced with controlled supination and pronation across the angle; while tying is not shown in that moment, the handling suggests corner control to keep the line straight and the margin well-supported. Elsewhere, after a stitch is tied and snugged, scissors are introduced to trim the tail. The scissors approach from the side opposite the driver to avoid crossing over the knot, while the assistant hand keeps gentle tension on the strand to ensure a clean, flush cut.

The operator also demonstrates secure knot technique. Where tying is captured, the loops are squared with alternating throws, using instrument ties to maintain even tension. The knot is positioned directly over the incision or just off the wound line when appropriate, and the strands are laid parallel to the incision as the knot slides into place. On at least one stitch the knot is tied and left without immediate cutting, with the tails kept out of the field to proceed to the next placement. On another, the ends are trimmed promptly after the knot seats.

Later, the suture line appears again in a horizontal orientation near the top of the field, with multiple completed stitches already present on one side and a gap remaining toward the right. The operator reloads the needle, aligning the tip for a perpendicular entry into the gaping segment, but pauses to finalize instrument setup. In these preparatory frames, there is no tissue contact; the edge is not everted yet. The needle and suture lie to the side while the driver’s jaws are partially open, confirming the next bite is imminent. The consistency of preparation—grasping the needle near the proximal third, setting the curve for a perpendicular approach, and bracketing the wound with the two hands—mirrors the earlier technique.

Returning to the center of the wound, the operator proceeds to close additional gaps. The hands oppose each other across the incision; the driver crosses the wound at a right angle for entry, then reorients along the incision as the needle tip emerges to be captured. The left hand remains close to the entry and exit points, lifting the dermis with forceps and, when needed, briefly stabilizing the needle tip to hand it off. The strands are managed to keep the field clear, typically trailing superiorly or inferiorly out of the workspace.

When the work advances beyond a prior knot, the operator trims the tail and reloads the needle for the next pass without disturbing the previously placed stitch. This deliberate separation—first trimming, then moving into needle loading—maintains knot integrity and field organization. As the line of closure extends, a consistent pattern of equally spaced stitches develops, each placed with symmetric bites, careful edge eversion, and knots that secure the approximation without inversion or undue tension.

Occasionally, the operator minimizes forceps use, instead controlling the entry point by using the driver tip or the fingers to steady the tissue, yet the entry remains perpendicular and depth control is maintained. This variation does not compromise overall technique, but the later frames again show a return to forceps-assisted eversion for precise bite placement.

Near the later stages, the wound again appears vertically in the field as the operator adds stitches just below a cluster of completed ones, reinforcing the impression of steady progression along one continuous cut rather than shifting targets. Following passage through both sides, instrument ties are performed and the tail is trimmed with scissors, adding another completed stitch to the row. The subsequent frames show scissor trimming of a previously tied stitch, then immediate reloading and positioning of the needle for another pass—an efficient rhythm that alternates between securing existing work and advancing the closure.

As the sequence nears its end, several frames show preparation for the next placement with no tissue penetration: the driver in one hand at the wound margin, the needle and strand oriented parallel to the incision to the opposite side, and hands poised in a working triangle over the line. A final brief moment captures the needle being reloaded at the proximal third from the swage, the curve oriented for a right-to-left pass into the remaining open segment. The wound edge is not yet grasped, indicating the next step will be to evert the margin and place the bite.

Across the entire procedure, the operator exhibits consistent technique themes:
- Needle handling is disciplined, with the grasp at the proximal third to mid-curve, consistent perpendicular entry, and wrist-driven rotation through the dermis.
- Bites are symmetric, a few millimeters from each edge, with forceps everting the margins to achieve crisp skin edge coaptation.
- Instrument ties are used to secure stitches, with careful management of tension and strand direction so knots seat over the incision without sliding.
- Hand positions evolve as needed to preserve a comfortable forehand stroke. The driver moves between hands when the direction of travel changes and the pad’s orientation shifts, but the relationship of the instruments to the wound—bracketing and converging over the incision—remains stable.
- Between stitches, brief pauses for reloading are used to restore ideal needle angle and hand alignment, reflecting a thoughtful, unhurried cadence.

By the final frames, the linear wound shows a series of neatly placed, evenly spaced stitches approximating much of its length. Several knots are tied and, in places, tails are already trimmed; in other segments, tails remain long pending completion of adjacent passes. A small gap persists toward the rightmost portion of the line where the next stitch is being set up: the needle has been reloaded and oriented, the driver is positioned, and the forceps are ready to lift the edge. The closure is well underway, with the central and adjacent segments neatly coapted, edge eversion preserved, and the next bite prepared to continue completing the line. Any brief lapses—moments without active edge eversion during preparation, or instances where scissors appear before cutting occurs—reflect setup rather than departures from the method, and the core technique remains coherent and consistent throughout.
