Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion is disciplined: you set the needle perpendicular, follow the curve, hand off cleanly, and immediately transition to a consistent instrument-tie sequence. The drive–tie–trim rhythm is repeatable and efficient; counter‑tension during knot seating is well balanced, and the needle is reliably parked out of the knot’s path. Hands generally remain in the work zone, and slack management is purposeful, keeping the field organized.
