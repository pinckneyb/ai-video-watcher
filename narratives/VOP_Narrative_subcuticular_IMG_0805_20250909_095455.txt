COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a synthetic skin pad with three linear cuts. One line—the vertical slit at the far left edge of the pad—receives all operative attention. The centrally located incision already bears a row of prior interrupted sutures but is never manipulated in this sequence, and the separate slit on the right remains untouched throughout. What follows is a continuous closing of the left vertical wound from its lower portion upward using simple interrupted sutures, with consistent technique and careful control of tissue eversion and suture tension.

The work opens at the lower third of the left incision. The operator establishes an efficient, repeatable setup: the left hand carries a needle driver and the right hand uses Adson-style tissue forceps. The curved needle is consistently loaded near two-thirds from the tip (occasionally a touch closer to the midpoint/proximal third when leverage is needed), with the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin. The right-hand forceps gently pick up the dermal edge to evert the lip and present a crisp entry point. With the wound straddled, the left hand advances the needle in a controlled arc, outside-in on the near side, following the needle’s curve to protect the tissue and distribute force across the dermis. The thread trails off to the operator’s left as the needle traverses. These early passes are all about establishing the first stitch: positioning, driving, regrasping the needle to complete the arc, and beginning the setup for an instrument tie. At this stage no knot is yet secured, but the foundational steps—bite geometry and clean tissue handling—are evident.

As the sequence progresses, the operator alternates between managing the needle and managing slack. At one point, the assisting hand holds the free suture end rather than forceps, controlling tension and exposure as the driver aligns for a superior bite on the same incision. Where forceps are not used, the driver tip and gentle traction on the suture are used to stabilize the edge. Soon after, the right hand brings pickups back into play to lift the near lip, and the needle tip is aligned precisely at the epidermal margin of the left edge to initiate penetration across the gap. The near-to-far path is consistent: perpendicular entry, firm follow-through along the curve, and controlled exit on the far lip—always with attention to symmetric purchase to encourage even approximation when tied.

At the inferior end of the line, the first bite is completed and the needle is retrieved and repositioned. The operator prepares for an instrument tie but delays finalizing the knot while completing the pass across to the far side, then regrasping the needle for the second half of the stitch. Throughout, the free limb trails to the left side of the pad, kept out of the working field. The forceps continue to evert and stabilize as needed; the driver executes the arc and then transitions to knot-tying duty.

The first completed stitch appears at the mid–lower portion of the left incision. The operator uses an instrument tie: the needle driver forms the loops, and the opposite hand manages the free limb over the wound. Throws are laid down carefully to snug the tissue without crushing, yielding a small, square knot that sits neatly with the wound edges gently everted. After cutting, the needle is reloaded in the driver, indicating preparation for the next stitch. At this point, there is 1 completed knot on the left line.

The next stitch is built adjacent to the first, slightly more proximal. The left hand keeps the driver lateral to the wound; the right hand, with forceps, controls the opposite lip and occasionally retrieves the needle tip as it emerges through the far edge. Scissors appear briefly in the left hand during slack management, but the dominant pattern is driver in the left, forceps in the right. The needle is again driven in a perpendicular fashion through the near edge, swung across in a smooth rotation, and seized by the forceps for delivery through the far side. As the suture is drawn across, the edges approximate with minimal blanching—evidence of appropriate bite depth and spacing. With these two lower stitches placed and tied in sequence, the incision shows 2 completed interrupted sutures along its lower half and an open upper segment.

Attention then shifts to the top of the same wound. With two completed stitches visible below, the operator moves to close the superior segment. The right-hand forceps remain integral, lifting each lip and exposing the intended entry/exit points; the left-hand driver maintains the perpendicular orientation and follows the curvature of the needle to protect the synthetic skin. On the far lip, the forceps briefly elevate the dermis to present the needle tip, which is then grasped and delivered. Suture lengths are equalized and slack is managed so there’s no strangulation of tissue, only firm approximation. This deliberate, reproducible sequence mirrors the technique used lower on the wound, showing consistency in hand habits and tissue respect.

With those passes complete, the line visibly carries three completed simple interrupted sutures—spaced, even, and with mild edge eversion—though at times instrument position and camera angle obscure part of the row. A new stitch is initiated near the superior end. The needle is again grasped near the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, held perpendicular to the skin, and aimed to take another left-to-right bite across the wound’s upper segment. The driver and forceps move toward the midline during tying attempts, cinching a throw down over the wound. In one sequence, loops are formed with the driver and the knot is drawn tight while the right hand steadies the needle near the swage; traction is applied along the long limb to lay the throw. During this tightening episode, four knots momentarily appear to be present across the line, including the one being cinched at the top. However, subsequent views clarify that, by the end of the session, only three sutures are securely completed on this incision.

The most superior stitch receives the most attention later. The left hand works just superior-lateral to the incision with the needle driver, sometimes exchanging for scissors to cut or to streamline thread management. The right hand, with forceps, stays immediately to the right of the bite site, stabilizing and everting the upper lip as the needle passes and as the suture is pulled across. At times only two completed knots are clearly visible in the field below the working site, a perspective artifact caused by instrument occlusion or framing; other views again show three distinct finished stitches. In all these upper-segment passes, the thread is drawn across the field and tensioned away from the wound axis to keep the view clear and prevent inadvertent snagging of tissue or instruments.

Throughout, the instruments operate like mirror-image levers across the incision line. The needle driver approaches from the left, the forceps from the right, and they meet above the wound margin for precise entry and exit. They often cross above the wound axis, especially during superior bites and tying, while the free strand is tensioned away from the working field. The driver consistently regrips the needle to optimize the angle for completing arcs and for extracting the point through the far side. The forceps are used judiciously to evert without crushing, gently pinching dermis rather than skin edge to protect the material. When tying, the driver acts as both a loop former and knot pusher, bringing throws to rest directly over the midline to lay them flat. Tension is distributed by pulling along the long limb as needed to snug a throw or adjust the lay of the knot.

As the final sequence unfolds at the very top of the wound, the left hand manipulates the needle holder near the superior half of the incision, intermittently over the left wound edge; the right hand holds both forceps and the free suture strand to manage tension. A fresh pass is initiated near the top. The curved needle, grasped near the proximal third from its tip, is oriented perpendicular to the surface and aimed for a left-to-right bite. The left edge is engaged and the needle is driven across; the right hand controls the free limb to maintain a clean field. Prior stitches show neat eversion and approximation. Despite this new pass, no knot is finally tied before the sequence ends.

By the end of the procedure, the left vertical incision shows three completed simple interrupted sutures. They are evenly spaced with mild, appropriate eversion and hold the wound edges in good approximation. At the superior end, a new stitch has been initiated—thread positioned and ready—but its knot has not been secured in the final view. The central incision remains unchanged and undisturbed throughout, and the separate slit on the right is untouched from start to finish.

Hand position evolves predictably—always straddling the wound, always keeping a perpendicular needle approach. Early on, the assisting hand occasionally manages only the suture strand without forceps; soon, Adson pickups are used routinely to evert edges and guide the needle tip. As work moves superiorly, the two hands converge over the midline for tying and occasionally cross above the incision. The left hand remains the primary driver of needle and knot throws; the right hand alternates between tissue control, needle retrieval, and suture tensioning. Scissors appear briefly for cutting and slack control but do not alter the basic pattern: driver left, forceps right, both moving in close, measured arcs that are parallel to the incision margins.

Technique remains consistent from the first pass to the last: simple interrupted stitches placed with a perpendicular needle, symmetric bites through dermis for strength, eversion achieved with gentle forceps handling, and throws laid by instrument tie. The operator equalizes suture lengths after each pass, uses long-limb traction to set throws, and avoids excessive blanching. Even when a top stitch is tightened vigorously in one segment, the following frames confirm that the final tally of secured stitches is three, with a new superior stitch in progress but not yet committed.

Suture Count Verification
- Start: 0 completed sutures on the left wound.
- First completion: 1 completed stitch appears at the mid–lower portion after the first instrument tie.
- Progression: A second stitch is placed and tied below the upper segment, bringing the count to 2.
- Advancement superiorly: A third stitch is added higher on the line; several views show three completed knots with a new top stitch in progress.
- Brief tightening episode at the top: A knot is cinched; at that moment four knots appear present, but later views confirm the top stitch is not finalized in the ultimate frames.
- Final frames: Three completed interrupted sutures are visible on the left incision; a new superior stitch has been initiated but not tied.

Final statement: The procedure resulted in 3 completed sutures. The left vertical incision is mostly closed with three evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches demonstrating mild edge eversion, and a fourth stitch is being initiated at the superior end but remains untied at the conclusion.
