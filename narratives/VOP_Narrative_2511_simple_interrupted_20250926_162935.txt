COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The recording opens on a practice skin pad mounted on a wooden board, bearing three parallel vertical slits (left, center, right) and corner anchoring staples. For the first minute and a half the field remains largely inactive: repeated short segments show the three slits in place but no operator hands, needles, or suture thread engaging any of them. The central slit, positioned midline on the pad, is visible in multiple early clips and appears slightly more open and lightly marked by prior passes, giving the impression it may be the intended target; nonetheless the camera only records a static setup during these intervals. No needle driver, forceps, or needle motion is visible, and the wound edges remain gently gaped without manipulation. These quiet periods (0–~160 s, with intermittent additional static frames later) are important context: they establish the baseline anatomy of the model and emphasize that the hands-on portion of the case begins only after these inactive segments.

At roughly the middle of the recording the working field changes decisively. A gloved operator approaches from the right side of the frame and consistently directs activity to the right-most vertical incision on the pad. From this point forward all needle passes, knot-tying, suture management, and final trimming are performed at the same right-side slit; the left and central slits remain untouched during the active portions. The remainder of the procedure is a focused sequence of interrupted closure steps on that single right-side wound.

Initial engagement of the right slit is deliberate and traditional in technique. The dominant hand (most commonly entering from the top-right/upper field) holds a needle driver; the nondominant hand approaches from the right-lateral or slightly inferior direction with toothed tissue forceps or by pinching suture tails. The needle used throughout is a curved swaged needle on a dark suture material; the driver typically grasps the needle at the mid‑shaft to the distal third—close enough to the tip to allow precise rotation but not so distal as to risk breakage or loss of purchase. The needle arc is oriented so that the convex surface will sweep through the dermis in a controlled downward/inward arc. Individual passes are short and controlled: shallow full‑thickness bites placed just a few millimetres from the wound margin, engaging dermal material rather than deep undermining. The forceps routinely tent or stabilize the near edge while the driver advances the needle through the opposite edge, producing small, superficial perforations rather than large tissue excursions.

Spatially the team maintains a compact working zone throughout: instrument tips and hands converge directly over the wound, typically within 1–3 cm of each other. The needle driver usually approaches from a superior/medial or overhead direction while the forceps approach from lateral/inferior angles. This orientation is consistently maintained: the driver provides the principal needle control, rotating the needle through its arc while the opposing instrument steadies the tissue and receives the needle tip when appropriate. When knotting or suture management is required, the nondominant hand frequently controls the free tail to maintain tension while the dominant hand forms throws. Scissors enter the field intermittently to trim suture tails after knotting.

The actual closure sequence proceeds as a serial placement of simple interrupted stitches placed in close proximity along the length of the right-side slit. The pattern of work appears methodical: the operator places a stitch, draws the suture through, tensions and forms throws, trims the tail when appropriate, and then repositions to place the next nearby stitch. Several frames show groups of already-placed interrupted sutures clustered together, with the operator frequently adding the next stitch immediately adjacent to the existing row. This indicates a sequential progression along the same incision rather than jumping between multiple wounds or beginning a continuous running pattern.

Technique specifics are consistently simple-interrupted in nature. Needle purchase is shallow-to-mid dermal in depth; the bites are placed just lateral to the wound margin and drawn through to approximate the two edges. The operator takes care to approximate with slight eversion of the skin edges—small upward tenting of the facings is visible in multiple frames—consistent with conventional cosmetic approximation to avoid inversion and to promote edge healing. Tissue handling is gentle: the forceps commonly grasp the skin edge lightly, preventing crush injury while stabilizing the tissue for accurate needle placement. The operator does not perform wide undermining, layered closure, or deep tissue bites in these clips; the focus is epidermal/dermal apposition using interrupted stitches.

Needle handling remains consistent but shows small refinements as the case progresses. Early passes demonstrate the driver grasp positioned about mid‑shaft to provide controlled rotation and extraction; in some passes the driver is advanced closer to the tip for a more precise bite when space is limited near existing knots. The needle orientation alternates between near‑perpendicular approaches and slightly oblique arcs depending on location along the wound and the angle required to enter the opposing edge. The operator repositions their grip as necessary, repositioning the driver between passes to accomplish optimal needle trajectories. These adjustments are subtle and reflect attention to needle purchase and controlled delivery of the arc through the mock dermis.

Knot technique is straightforward and pragmatic: after a stitch is pulled through the wound the operator tensions the loop and forms multiple throws to secure the knot. The nondominant hand is heavily involved in managing the free suture limb, maintaining counter‑tension while the dominant hand performs throws with the needle driver or alternately with a second instrument. In many frames the operator completes at least two to three throws to secure the interrupted stitch before trimming. Scissors are used to cut suture tails close to the knot once security is confirmed. Occasionally a small cluster of completed knots is visible as the operator continues proximally or distally along the incision, demonstrating sequential completion and suture trimming.

Hand positions evolve modestly over time but the general pattern remains constant. The early active passes show both hands in close proximity to the wound: the dominant hand located superior/right with the driver, and the nondominant hand approaching from the right/lateral side. As more stitches are placed and knots accumulate, the operator sometimes shifts slightly to maintain a comfortable angle for the next needle trajectory—oscillating between overhead and slightly lateral approach angles. In some frames only a single hand is visible momentarily (for example while the operator adjusts the pad or inspects the row of stitches), but both hands re-enter the working zone for subsequent needle passes. Toward the latter part of the procedure the hands continue to operate within the same compact field—driver above/medial and forceps lateral—to maintain precise control during remaining passes and during final knot tensioning/cutting.

Throughout the active period the suture line is managed in a linear, serial fashion. Early active frames show the first new stitches being placed near the distal end of the right slit, with subsequent frames revealing the operator moving along the wound and adding stitches in series. Several descriptions note adding a stitch immediately adjacent to an existing mattress of sutures; others describe working at the superior portion to “advance” the row. These observations together indicate a deliberate progression along the full length of the wound, with stitches placed at regular intervals to achieve uniform approximation. There is no evidence of conversion to a running or continuous pattern; instead, the operator repeatedly uses simple interrupted bites that are individually secured and trimmed.

Tissue interaction details are consistent across passes: the operator uses the forceps to evert and stabilize the near edge, then advances the needle through the opposite edge so that when the suture is tightened the edges oppose with slight outward evert. Bites are small and superficial—often described as 2–3 mm from the wound edge—minimizing tissue bulk within the knot. When the operator passes the needle, they commonly withdraw it and immediately tension the stitch to judge alignment before committing throws. This iterative approach ensures consistent approximation and reduces the chance of uneven edge apposition.

Intermittent assessment and adjustment occur regularly. In several frames the operator pauses to inspect the row of stitches, presses the pad gently to assess tension, or repositions a completed knot to maintain low profile. A short sequence near the end of the active period shows the operator smoothing the stitched area with a gloved finger, confirming uniformity of approximation. Tools such as scissors and small forceps are used for trimming and final handling; they are introduced briefly and then removed to permit subsequent needle passes. When only inspection is necessary, the dominant hand often withdraws the driver and the nondominant hand may finger‑test the closure.

By the close of the recording the right-side incision is uniformly approximated with a row of closely spaced interrupted sutures. Knots are tied and trimmed; wound edges are in close apposition with mild eversion at each bite, and the overall line is straight and tension-balanced. The operator performs a final inspection/adjustment, confirming that stitches are secure and that there are no loose tails. No continuous suture line is present, and the two other parallel slits remained untouched during the active segments. The procedure concludes with the working instruments withdrawn slightly from the immediate wound bed and the pad smoothed, leaving a neatly closed right-side incision with a completed series of interrupted sutures.

Throughout the case the team adheres to a conventional, reproducible interrupted suture technique: dominant-hand needle control, nondominant-hand tissue stabilization, mid‑to‑distal shaft needle grasping for controlled arcs, shallow dermal bites to achieve eversion, sequential placement of individual stitches with knot security and tail trimming, and compact instrument coordination within a small working field. Early inactive intervals of the study limit continuous observation of intention during those times, but once suturing begins the operator remains focused exclusively on that single right‑side incision, developing and completing a tidy interrupted closure from initial bite to final knot and trim.
