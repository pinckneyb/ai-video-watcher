COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses on a single short vertical skin incision located in the upper-central region of the practice pad, slightly to the right of midline. From the first frames through the end of the recording, the surgeon returns repeatedly to that same slit and performs stepwise closure along its length, working from the superior end and progressing inferiorly. The work is consistently confined to the synthetic dermal/epidermal layers of the pad; bites are deliberately superficial-to-mid‑dermal, producing close epidermal apposition with mild eversion. Over the course of the video the operator establishes a line of sequential interrupted skin sutures, tightening and managing suture tails between passes until the wound is fully approximated and instruments are withdrawn.

Initial approach and first passes
At the outset the incision appears as a short, full‑thickness linear defect with slightly gapped but compressible edges. The operator employs a two‑handed technique from the beginning: the dominant hand controls a needle driver while the nondominant hand manipulates tissue with fine toothed forceps or direct fingertip stabilization. The needle—consistently a curved surgical needle on monofilament suture—is repeatedly grasped in the driver close to its shaft (grips vary frame to frame from roughly one‑third to mid‑shaft), with the curve oriented to enable a controlled arc from the near edge to the far edge. The forceps elevate and evert the near wound margin to present the dermal plane before each pass, and bites are taken in short, precise arcs to control depth and keep the needle trajectory perpendicular or slightly oblique to the wound edge.

In the earliest frames the surgeon places the first stitch at the superior apex of the slit. The needle driver approaches from superior/cephalad in most instances, while the assisting hand comes from a lateral/right or inferior position; the tips of instruments are kept very close (typically within a few millimeters to a couple of centimeters) to ensure predictable bite depth and accurate edge apposition. After each pass the filament is drawn through and managed by the free hand: tails are tensioned, loop orientation adjusted, and knot‑tying preparations made.

Sequential placement and reinforcement
Following the initial superior stitch, the operator moves sequentially down the length of the incision, adding additional interrupted stitches immediately inferior to previously placed ones. The progression is orderly and methodical: the needle is passed, the suture drawn through, tension applied to evert and approximate the edges, and the suture tail is held or manipulated while the driver is reloaded for the next throw. Multiple frames document this cycle in repetition—needle grasp, controlled arc through the dermis, forceps stabilization and eversion, suture pull‑through and management—so that stitches are placed at consistent spacing and depth relative to previously placed sutures.

Hands and instruments maintain a highly coordinated choreography throughout. The dominant needle‑holding hand most often approaches from above or slightly lateral and carries the needle in short rotational motions; the nondominant hand alternates between fine forceps grasping the near edge and bare fingertips providing countertraction and tail management. Where visible, the nondominant hand frequently lies just lateral to the wound, stabilizing tissue and receiving the needle exit while the driver completes the pass. Occasionally the non‑dominant hand passes the suture tail to the dominant side to facilitate knot tying, and in other frames it remains off‑camera while manipulation continues from the visible hand.

Technique details and small variations
The technique is consistent in its fundamental aim—interrupted dermal/epidermal approximation with slight eversion—but several small variations appear in execution. The driver grip on the needle alternates between mid‑shaft and slightly nearer the tip, depending on the bite being taken and the operator’s need for control in tight spaces adjacent to existing knots. Needle trajectories are adjusted to avoid collision with previously placed sutures; when the line of knots is already present superiorly the driver is angled more perpendicularly to take a bite just inferior to them. Bites are kept shallow to mid‑dermal in the synthetic substrate, and the forceps frequently tent the edge before passage so the stitch captures comparable tissue on both sides.

There are intermittent frames where instruments withdraw from view or work shifts slightly off‑frame—suture tails are sometimes pulled or adjusted by hands that are not always visible in the still frames. At times knot handling and tightening are the focus: the operator tightens a just‑placed interrupted stitch, adjusts the loop, and arranges the tails before cutting. In several sequences the needle is reoriented and regrasped to facilitate completion of the pass or to present the tip for easier retrieval by the opposing forceps.

Management of existing knots and alignment
As the row of interrupted stitches develops, the operator pays attention to consistent orientation and spacing so that the skin edges lie in a straight line without stepped misalignment. After a suture is passed, the free end is tensioned and the knot is placed or prepared for tying; the operator then adjusts the tissue to neutralize puckering and to distribute tension evenly along the wound. Slight puckering and localized tissue bunching around needle sites are evident where multiple adjacent bites have compressed the synthetic material, but the operator actively mitigates this by careful tensioning and by placing subsequent stitches to smooth the line.

Occasionally, frames capture periods of focused knot manipulation rather than fresh needle passes—instrument tips and fingertips converge over a suture site as the operator tightens or trims. When line continuity is compromised visually (hands off camera, or the suture tail pulled out of the immediate field), the operator rapidly reestablishes control: the needle is reintroduced, forceps again evert the margin, and stitching resumes inferior to the last secure knot.

Coordination and spatial relationships
A defining feature throughout is the close spatial relationship between hands and instruments and the wound. The needle driver and forceps consistently work within a compact working zone—typically within one to three centimeters of the wound margin—to allow precise control of bite depth and edge alignment. Instrument tips are often separated by only a few millimeters while the needle traverses tissue, providing stable transfer and minimizing tissue drag. Dominant hand approach directions vary slightly over time (superior‑to‑inferior, right‑to‑left, or cephalad approaches), but remaining coordinated with the tensioning hand ensures consistent technique. Where the operator must access the next bite close to an existing knot, the driver is repositioned to enter from a slightly different angle, and the assistant hand is placed to protect or lift adjacent stitches.

Evolving aspects of technique
Although the basic approach—simple interrupted, superficial dermal bites with eversion—remains constant, skillful adjustments accumulate as the procedure progresses. Grip positions on the needle are refined for specific passes; the driver is sometimes held closer to the tip for narrow bites adjacent to prior sutures, and sometimes a bit more proximal to leverage rotation through thicker portions of the pad. The nondominant hand transitions fluidly between forceps and fingers as required: when fine elevation is needed, tweezers are used; when coarse stabilization or tail management is needed, fingertips step in. The operator demonstrates an economy of motion—quick predictable arcs for needle delivery, minimal extraneous movement when tightening knots, and efficient handoff of suture tails—so the closure advances steadily.

Intermittent deviations and limitations
A few frames show brief interruptions in the typical pattern: in some moments the needle is not visible and only suture tails and existing loops are manipulated, indicating knot tying or tail positioning off camera. In isolated sequences one frame set suggests a more continuous strand being advanced, but these episodes are brief and are followed by a return to discrete interrupted passes and knot security. These occasional inconsistencies in visible technique are likely attributable to camera framing, occlusion by the operator’s hands, or the temporary emphasis on knot tying rather than fresh passes. Overall, the predominant and sustained technique throughout is interrupted skin closure with consistent superficial dermal bites and active management of each loop before proceeding.

Approaching completion
As work advances toward the inferior end of the slit, the pattern of repeated passes, tensioning, knot tying, and tail management continues with the same disciplined approach. The previously placed knots produce a staggered line that approximates the epidermal edges with slight eversion; the operator periodically adjusts tension to smooth out puckering caused by clustered stitches. Instrument withdrawal is gradual: as the last stitches are completed, the needle is removed from the field and remaining tails are trimmed or positioned. On the final passes the hands still work within the compact zone established earlier—needle driver above, forceps or fingers lateral or inferior—before moving off the pad.

Final appearance and state
By the end of the recording the incision is uniformly approximated along its length by a row of closely spaced, evenly oriented interrupted stitches. The skin edges sit in close apposition with mild eversion at suture sites, and localized puckering around individual knots is present but minimized through active tensioning and spacing decisions. Multiple knots and tails are managed tidily along the superior portion, and the operator finishes by withdrawing instruments and resting hands away from the wound. The synthetic dermal surface shows the characteristic pattern of sequential interrupted closures: small raised points at each stitch entry/exit and a continuous, aligned seam where the edges meet. The working posture, instrument grips, and exchange between driver and forceps remain consistent from start to finish, reflecting a deliberate, controlled technique aimed at precise epidermal approximation.

Summary assessment
Throughout the case the operator consistently uses a two‑handed approach—dominant needle driver delivering a curved needle in short controlled arcs and nondominant forceps or fingers elevating and stabilizing the opposing margin—to place sequential interrupted dermal/epidermal sutures from the superior end of the incision toward the inferior end. Needle grasping varies slightly to accommodate tight spaces and adjacent knots, but the core principles—superficial-to-mid dermal bites, slight eversion, close instrument coordination, and methodical management of suture tails and knots—are maintained across the entire procedure. Occasional frames show brief periods of knot adjustment or off‑camera manipulation, but these are integrated into the steady progression of stitch placement and do not interrupt the overall continuity or the end result: a neatly approximated linear closure with evenly spaced, tension‑controlled interrupted sutures and instruments withdrawn once the work is complete.
