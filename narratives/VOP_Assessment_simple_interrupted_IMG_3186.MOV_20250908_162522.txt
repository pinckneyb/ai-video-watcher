Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
You demonstrated basic control of the needle driver and forceps, with mostly perpendicular passes and acceptable eversion on the completed stitches. However, the rhythm was stopâ€“start: repeated repositioning and rehearsals without following through to place the next suture broke continuity and wasted motion.
