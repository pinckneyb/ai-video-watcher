COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire recording follows a single repair carried out on a short skin defect located on the left side of the simulator pad. From the outset the operator returns repeatedly to the same incision — a short linear wound positioned in the left-central / lower-left quadrant of the pad — and works it in a stepwise fashion, placing a series of separated stitches along its length until the line is closed. Although individual frame descriptions sometimes describe slightly different orientations or small shifts in the view (vertical vs transverse), the physical features, neighboring completed stitches and the consistent left‑side location indicate the same incision is being managed continuously.

Opening and initial exposure
At the start the wound presents as a shallow full‑thickness skin defect on the silicone model with exposed subcutaneous foam visible at times. The operator positions both hands immediately adjacent to the incision and routinely uses a two‑instrument technique: a needle‑holding instrument (needle driver/curved forceps) and toothed or fine tissue forceps (Adson‑style pickup). Early maneuvers emphasize controlled presentation of the tissue plane for the needle. The non‑dominant instrument steadies and slightly elevates the near edge while the dominant instrument holds the curved, swaged needle near its mid‑shaft so that the curvature can be used to rotate the tip through the dermis. The edges are lifted with the forceps and the adjacent tissue is tented to expose the dermal plane; at least in the earliest frames this shows visible yellow foam beneath, consistent with engagement of the subcutaneous layer during initial bites on a fresh wound.

Needle handling and bite selection
Throughout the procedure the operator consistently grasps the curved needle in the needle driver close to the needle body (mid‑shaft / near the swage) rather than at the very tip. The needle is rotated in a controlled arc and advanced through the tissue using the curvature to create short, precise bites. The trajectory is usually shallow and short — aiming to capture dermis (superficial to mid‑dermal) and to produce slightly everted apposition when the stitch is tensioned. At times the descriptions indicate somewhat deeper dermal/subcuticular bites, particularly when the near edge is elevated and the subcutaneous foam is visible, but far more often the passes are skin‑only or mid‑dermal, with small, closely spaced bites that align the epidermal margins without excessive tissue bulk.

Instrument roles and hand positions
From the first minutes onward a repeated choreography is evident. One instrument — usually the left hand coming from the lateral side of the wound — acts as the needle driver, presenting and advancing the needle. The other instrument — usually a toothed forceps in the right hand or the operator’s fingertips — opposes the needle: approximating the near edge, steadying tissue and receiving the needle as it exits. Frequently the right hand abandons instrument tips for direct fingertip control, using gloved fingers to pinch and align the edges and to pull the suture tail while the needle driver manages the needle. This mix of instrument/in‑hand finger use alternates throughout the recording; the operator repeatedly shifts roles so that either hand can be the needle controller or the assistant depending on the particular pass, but hands remain tightly coordinated and almost always within a few centimeters of the wound.

Sequence of passes and stitch placement
Each repair cycle follows a predictable sequence: the needle driver grips the curved needle mid‑shaft; the forceps elevates the near edge and presents the opposite side; the needle is rotated and passed through one margin; the instrument on the far side receives or withdraws the needle point; the suture is drawn through and a loop is formed; the free tail is organized for knot tying; the suture is tensioned and secured with knots. This cycle is repeated serially along the length of the incision so each new stitch lies adjacent to the previous ones. The operator tends to work from one end of the wound toward the other — frequently reported as placing stitches at the medial/left end after previously placed sutures lay laterally — so the closure proceeds in a contiguous, methodical fashion until the entire defect is approximated.

Tissue handling and edge apposition
Throughout the repair the operator’s concern is precise epidermal alignment. Forceps and fingertip control are used to produce slight eversion of the edges before securing a knot; the bites are small and placed at a shallow depth to avoid excess dead space or puckering. The needle arcs are controlled so that the tip exits closely opposite the entry point, producing matched, atraumatic apposition. When the operator needs to take a slightly deeper or more robust bite — for example when the edge is tented and subcutaneous foam is exposed — the instrument technique adapts by slightly changing the angle of approach and lifting the tissue a bit more with the forceps. Otherwise the technique remains skin‑focused with minimal crush injury to the synthetic dermis.

Knot management and finishing maneuvers
After passing the needle and drawing the suture through, the operator consistently organizes and tensions the thread before tying. Several frames show the transition from needle passage to knot formation: the suture tails are held with fingers or forceps, the needle driver is used to form throws, and knots are seated down against the skin. The right hand frequently assumes control of the tails and uses fingertips to dress and tension the suture line while the left­-hand driver forms the knot. At various points the operator manipulates the suture to practice proper knot technique — alternating hand positions, pulling one limb while stabilizing the other — to ensure secure, low‑profile knots that do not invert the edge. After knotting the tail may be prepared for cutting (frames indicate the needle driver and forceps are used to place and tension the knot rather than an explicit cutting action being shown in every cycle), and the line is smoothed so each completed stitch sits evenly with its neighbors.

Spatial relationships and field organization
Across the entire recording the working field remains compact. Hands, instruments and finger tips stay within 1–3 cm of the incision; approach angles are shallow and opposed so that needle and forceps tips converge over the wound. The needle driver most commonly approaches from the left side of the incision and the forceps approach from the right (or vice‑versa in a few passes), crossing slightly as required by the needle arc. The operator frequently places the non‑dominant hand on the near edge to elevate and evert while the dominant instrument passes the needle through the far edge. At multiple points the operator uses direct fingertip control over the wound center to steady tissue and manage suture tension while the other hand operates instruments. This tight, coordinated posture is maintained as stitches are added in sequence, providing predictable control of needle trajectory and suture management.

Consistency and minor variations in technique
The suturing technique is consistent across the procedure: simple interrupted stitches placed with a curved needle using a mid‑shaft grip, small dermal bites producing slight eversion, and secure knot‑tying with suture tails dressed away from the wound. Small variations appear: occasionally a pass appears slightly deeper (engaging subcuticular foam), sometimes bites are more superficial epidermal passes, and at times the right hand uses fingertips rather than forceps to manipulate the suture. These variations are adaptive rather than systematic — the operator adjusts bite depth, grip and hand role to the particular spot along the incision or to the local tissue tension. Overall there is no change in fundamental technique; the pattern remains an interrupted skin closure executed with conservative bite depth and consistent instrument control.

Progress along the incision and continuity of closure
From start to finish the operator addresses gaps between previously placed stitches, placing each new interrupted stitch in the available space and progressively closing the defect. Completed stitches remain intact and are left in place as the operator moves to the next gap. The choreography at each new placement is familiar: presenting the needle, receiving it with opposing forceps or fingertips, pulling the suture through until a loop remains for knotting, arranging the tails, and forming the knot into a low‑profile secure throw. Where the operator has already closed adjacent segments, subsequent passes are placed just distal or proximal to prior stitches to maintain even spacing and consistent tension across the line. At moments the operator pauses with the needle already passed and uses the free hand to align the edge or to reposition a previously tied knot before proceeding.

Evolution of hand positioning over time
Hand positions evolve slightly as closure advances: earlier passes sometimes show the needle holder in the right hand and the forceps in the left, reflecting handedness flexibility, whereas the majority of later frames show the needle driver in the left and forceps / fingertip control in the right. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument, the pattern of one instrument presenting/advancing the needle while the other opposes and prepares the tissue is constant. The operator moves the hands incrementally along the incision, keeping the distance between instrument tips small so that needle arc, tissue control and knot formation remain precise. When knot tying is occurring the instrument positions shift subtly to facilitate looping and pulling throws; fingertips may come over the wound to compress and seat the knot before release.

Tactile control and suture tensioning
Repeated attention is paid to the amount of tension placed on each stitch. The operator uses fingertips to approximate the two edges and to avoid over‑tightening that would invert the skin or cause dimpling of the pad. When the suture is drawn through, the tail is controlled so edges meet with minimal gap and with slight eversion to optimize epidermal alignment. Knot throws are tightened incrementally, and the suture is dressed down against the skin so the knot sits flush rather than bulky. This careful tension control is a throughline of the procedure and helps maintain even apposition along the entire repaired segment.

Final passes and endpoint
In the final phases the operator focuses on finishing the last gaps, dressing knots and arranging the tails. Instrument activity shifts from repeated needle passage to suture management: pulling the strand, forming final throws, and smoothing the repair. Completed stitches lie in a linear series along the incision with consistent spacing, slight edge eversion, and good epidermal apposition. The wound is closed along its length; there is no obvious residual gaping and the skin edges present as a continuous approximated line with neatly seated interrupted knots.

Overall impression
The procedure is a textbook series of simple interrupted skin closures performed on a small left‑sided simulator wound. Technique remains consistent: the curved needle is gripped mid‑shaft by the needle driver and rotated through short dermal bites while opposing forceps or fingertips elevate and present the opposite edge. The operator moves methodically from one side of the incision to the other, placing stitches in the available gaps, tensioning and seating each knot, and preserving uniform edge eversion and alignment. Hand and instrument choreography is tightly confined over the wound, with repeated crossing and close‑proximity control to maintain needle trajectory and suture management. Small, adaptive variations in bite depth and which hand assumes which instrument do not alter the overall approach. By the end of the recording the incision is fully approximated with evenly spaced interrupted sutures that produce an even, slightly everted epithelial line and securely tied suture knots, indicating a completed, well executed skin closure.
