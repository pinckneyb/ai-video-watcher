Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
The sequence showed a controlled rhythm with consistent orthogonal needle drives, deliberate presentation of tissue, and reliable transitions from passage to instrument tying. Hand coordination was steady: the right hand managed the driver and knot pusher role, while the left hand alternated between edge control and managing the free end without drifting away from the field. Overall flow was orderly from superior to inferior with minimal unnecessary travel.
