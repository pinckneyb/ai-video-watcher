COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire sequence takes place on a three‑incision silicone practice pad, but only the central vertical wound is manipulated from start to finish. The two longer lateral slits remain untouched and serve merely as landmarks. The operator proceeds with a series of simple interrupted sutures along this central slit, steadily approximating its edges from the superior portion down toward the inferior end. Throughout, instrument use is consistent: a needle driver in the right hand, Adson tissue forceps in the left for tissue control, and scissors introduced intermittently to trim tails. Needle handling shows conscientious attention to perpendicular skin entry, following the needle’s arc, and taking symmetric dermal bites to promote reliable edge eversion and alignment.

The case begins with the wound open and gaping slightly. In the earliest sequence, the left hand uses Adson forceps to gently lift and evert each skin edge, presenting the dermis to the needle. The right hand, with the needle driver, holds the curved needle at a stable point on its body—roughly at the proximal third to the midpoint—so that the tip maintains a perpendicular approach to the skin. The first stitch is initiated across the mid‑portion of the central incision. Entry is made on the right wound margin; the needle is followed through its curve, re‑grasped as necessary, and then advanced through the left margin to exit at a symmetric depth. The suture now spans the gap but is not yet tied. At this point there are no completed knots on the wound: it is one pass in progress, without a secured throw.

Soon after, tying begins on that first stitch. The right hand continues to operate the needle driver over the center of the wound, while the left hand alternates between stabilizing an edge with forceps and managing the free suture strand for instrument ties. Throws are formed with the driver, and the strands are pulled in opposing directions along the axis of the incision to set the knot without crushing the tissue. The edges draw together with slight eversion, and the knot cinches down in the superior/central portion of the slit. This sequence ends with one visible, completed simple interrupted suture on the central line; the other two practice slits remain untouched.

With the first knot seated, attention stays at the superior end. The right‑hand driver now acts largely as a knot pusher and tensioning tool, and the left index finger maintains controlled tension on the opposing strand, preventing loosening while the knot beds down. Puckering around the knot is minimal to moderate, the expected look of a tightened simple interrupted stitch in synthetic skin. The tail on the right remains long. This brief segment focuses on final seating of that first stitch, with the left hand poised for the next placement—forceps beginning to engage the inferior lip of the central slit in preparation for the subsequent bite.

The next stitch is planned just inferior to the first. The left hand intermittently lifts one edge and then the other to ensure consistent bite depth and eversion while the right hand uses the needle driver to perform instrument ties. In this sequence, the needle itself is not passed; instead, the operator completes the tying of a stitch that had been previously placed but not secured. Throws are guided around the driver with deliberate, alternating tension. As the knot draws down, the right hand pulls the long free end laterally and slightly inferiorly, while the left hand stabilizes the short end near the wound. Tissue alignment remains within the same central incision, and the wound edges approximate neatly. By the end of this passage, the second stitch is in the process of being secured, with its knot formed but its tails not yet cut. At this moment, there is still one clearly completed stitch (the first, superior knot), and one newly tied suture that is being finalized.

Completion of that second stitch follows promptly. The right hand takes up scissors to trim tails while the left hand manages the long strand and provides counter‑tension as needed. The needle is safely out of the way—parked on the free end to keep it from dangling near the wound while tying and cutting proceed. The final squaring of the knot is done just inferior to the initial stitch, and the tails are cut. By the end of this sequence, there are two completed simple interrupted knots on the central incision: one superior, one immediately inferior to it. The spatial choreography is deliberate: the right‑hand instrument works just below and to the right of the wound line to guide the knot into place, while the left hand controls the standing end from the superior/left side, preventing slack from developing as tails are trimmed.

Having secured the first two stitches in the upper half of the incision, the operator moves down the wound to place the next one. The left hand again assumes its tissue‑control role, stationed just inferior‑left to the wound, everting and presenting the edges. The right‑hand needle driver, positioned inferior‑right, grasps the needle at about one‑third to halfway from the swaged end and brings the needle perpendicular to the skin. Entry occurs on the right margin, and the needle is driven in a smooth arc across to exit the left margin at a symmetric depth in the dermal/subdermal plane. Throughout this pass the forceps gently lift the skin to avoid crush and to help the needle track through stabilised tissue; the wound edges are shown clearly in profile for precise placement. By the end of this run the suture thread has been drawn through and lies across the defect, but knot tying for this new, more inferior stitch is not yet shown. At this time, there are still two completed sutures at the superior half of the wound.

The following segment shows the tying phase for the inferior third. The needle is not passing tissue here; instead, the right‑hand needle driver is used instrumentally to shuttle and tension the suture ends. The left hand alternates between holding the forceps and managing the proximal strand above and to the left of the wound. Several throws are formed with alternating hand dominance to ensure the knot lies flat and securely; the existing stitches keep the edges already well approximated, and this new knot further improves alignment at the lower third. Even so, by the end of this portion, the knot remains “in progress” and not yet fully finalized—no new completed suture is added to the count during these frames.

Next, tying and tail management advance. The right hand alternates between the driver and scissors, while the left hand lightly grasps the dermal edge with forceps to stabilize tension as the knot is seated. Here, the operator focuses on securing a stitch that lies between the previously completed superior and inferior knots—effectively creating a neatly spaced trio. Early in these frames, only two finished stitches are visible (one superior, one inferior). As throws are completed and the knot is cinched down, the driver guides it into position, the forceps maintain gentle eversion, and the scissors trim the excess. The segment concludes with three completed simple interrupted stitches along the central wound: superior, mid, and a second mid/inferior—neatly spaced and aligned. Instruments approach symmetrically during this sequence, the driver and scissors from the patient’s inferior side, and the forceps from the superior/left. Hands cross briefly while the knot is seated and the tails are cut, but all work remains tightly centered on the same incision.

Attention now turns to the open inferior gap that remains. The wound, now closed across its mid‑portion with three sutures, shows an unclamped space at the bottom that requires one more stitch. The left hand positions the Adson forceps at roughly the 7–8 o’clock position relative to the wound’s inferior end, everting first the left and then the right edge. The right hand brings the needle driver in from the 4–5 o’clock position, again grasping the needle at about two‑thirds from the tip to maximize control over its curve. The needle is held perpendicular to the skin and advanced through the dermis/subdermal tissue on one side, then across to the opposite edge with a controlled, symmetric bite. The pass is initiated cleanly; the suture is drawn through to span the defect; no knot is tied yet in these frames. Three completed stitches are visible above this new placement, and the inferior gap is now bridged by a fresh pass awaiting tying.

The final sequence centers on completing and securing that most inferior stitch to finish the line. The needle is not being passed at this point; the needle driver functions as a knot pusher and a tensioning tool. Working at the inferior third of the central wound, the right hand positions the driver just to the right of the midline, while the left hand comes in with forceps from the left to help guide tension and, at moments, to stabilize the tissue edges as the knot is snugged down. Scissors appear to prepare for trimming, although cutting does not occur within these specific frames. As the throws are tightened, the inferior edges coapt nicely under gentle, alternating tension. Notably, one of the midline knots briefly presents with a loop that resembles a mattress configuration; however, no actual mattress pass is taken in these sequences, and the closure remains a series of simple interrupted stitches along the same wound. By the end of this series, four completed sutures are clearly visible on the central incision: one superior, two in the mid‑portion (one of which carries that mattress‑like appearance of a loop), and the newly secured inferior stitch. The two lateral practice slits have not been manipulated at any point.

Hand positioning evolves predictably over the course of the repair. Each needle pass begins with a bimanual routine: the forceps in the left hand evert and steady the targeted edge while the right‑hand needle driver approaches perpendicular to the skin. The driver re‑grasps the needle when needed to follow the curve smoothly through the tissue, ensuring consistent bite depth and exit symmetry. During tying, roles shift: the right hand frequently uses the driver to form and guide throws and to push knots down; when cutting is required, scissors are swapped into the right hand, while the left hand either holds the standing end of the suture to maintain tension or gently stabilizes the wound edge. The operator occasionally parks the needle on the free end during tying to keep it off the field and away from the wound, a safe and efficient practice. Spatially, the instruments orbit the incision with intent: when working near the superior stitch, the driver operates just superior/right while the left fingertip or forceps manage tension across the top of the slit; in the mid‑incision, the driver and forceps cross over briefly to square knots; and at the inferior end, the driver comes from the lower right with the forceps from the lower left, meeting over the inferior segment of the wound to finalize approximation.

Tissue handling remains gentle throughout. The Adson forceps are used to lift rather than crush, exposing the dermal plane and helping the needle track evenly. The needle, consistently oriented perpendicular to the epidermal surface at entry, is driven in an arc that follows its curvature, minimizing tissue trauma and ensuring predictable bite geometry. Where the camera shows edges closely, slight eversion is achieved—subtle with the synthetic skin but sufficient to bring the wound edges into apposition without inversion. Knot seating is deliberate and incremental, with alternating throws and opposing traction to square the knot and prevent slippage.

The progression of stitch placement and completion is orderly and continuous along the same line:

- The repair begins with a single pass across the central portion of the wound; initially, there are 0 completed sutures.

- The first stitch is tied at the mid/superior portion, bringing the count to 1 completed suture.

- That knot is set and seated, confirming a stable count of 1.

- A second stitch is then tied just inferior to the first; completion and tail trimming occur in the subsequent sequence, raising the count to 2 completed sutures.

- A new pass is taken lower on the same wound; tying begins at the inferior third but is not finalized immediately, so the count remains at 2.

- The next tying sequence secures another stitch, yielding a neat trio; the count increases to 3 completed sutures.

- With three sutures in the mid‑portion, the operator places and then ties the final inferior stitch; the count rises to 4 completed sutures.

By the end of the procedure, the central vertical wound is closed with four simple interrupted sutures, spaced from superior to inferior with good approximation and slight eversion. The superior and midline sutures show seated knots with trimmed tails; the most inferior stitch has just been secured, with scissors present to trim in the final frames. The lateral practice slits remain unmanipulated. Apart from one loop that momentarily looks like a mattress due to how the throw lies, the pattern used throughout is simple interrupted, with no additional techniques introduced.

Mandatory suture count verification:
- The total number of completed sutures visible in the final frames is 4. 
- The count increased as follows: 0 at the start; 1 after the first tie; 2 after the second was tied and cut; 3 once the middle stitch was secured and trimmed; and finally 4 after the inferior stitch was tied at the end.
- Final state: the central vertical incision is closed with four completed simple interrupted sutures, with the edges approximated and slightly everted, and with tails trimmed on the earlier knots and the inferior knot freshly secured.

Taken together, the video depicts a coherent, single‑line closure of the central incision using simple interrupted technique, meticulous needle control, and consistent, safe instrument handling. The hands and instruments move in a controlled pattern relative to the wound—left hand everting edges and managing the suture, right hand driving the needle and forming instrument ties—resulting in a tidy four‑suture closure by the conclusion of the sequence.
