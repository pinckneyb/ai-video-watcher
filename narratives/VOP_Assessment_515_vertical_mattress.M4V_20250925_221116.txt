COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
This video documents a complete interrupted-suture repair of the central vertical slit on the practice pad — the middle of three parallel linear incisions positioned slightly to the right of the pad center (also referenced in the footage as the second slit from the right). The sequence follows a single continuous line of repair from initial bite placement through progressive stitch additions, knot securing, tail management and final trimming. The operator consistently uses a two-handed technique with a needle driver in the dominant hand and fine tissue forceps/needle-holding forceps in the non-dominant hand, and the procedural flow is characterized by repeated, tightly coordinated cycles of needle placement, suture advancement, tensioning and knot work across successive points of the same incision.

0–30 seconds (0.0–29.0 s)
The procedure begins with an initial simple interrupted pass into the mid-portion of the central slit. The right hand, holding a curved needle in a needle driver grasped near the shaft, brings the needle down in a controlled arc while the left hand lifts and approximates the near edge with Adson-style forceps. The needle rotates through the far edge and the suture thread is drawn through, capturing superficial dermal material and bringing the opposing margins into proximity. Instrument tips remain close (roughly 2–4 cm apart) with the needle driver carrying a near-vertical orientation and the forceps applying gentle elevation/eversions to present bite tissue. Immediately thereafter the operator repeats similar coordinated movements — another bite is delivered with the driver oriented from above while the non-dominant hand manipulates the free suture tail, preparing the stitch for tying. Early frames already show a growing cluster of interrupted loops and emerging suture tails across the repair line, indicating the operator is working sequentially along the same slit rather than moving between multiple wounds.

30–60 seconds (30.0–59.0 s)
Having established initial stitches, attention shifts to knot management and tightening of recently placed sutures. In some passes the needle is not actively being re-passed; rather, the needle-driver and forceps are used to dress and seat knots and to manage suture tails. The right-hand instrument frequently adopts a vertical-to-oblique orientation over the incision, grasping the needle or suture near the mid-shaft when manipulating looped material; the left hand stabilizes suture strands, holds tails laterally and occasionally receives the needle tip. The operator consistently maintains close bimanual spacing (≈2–4 cm) to allow precise transfers and to avoid tangles. During this phase the knots are sequentially arranged and clipped — curved scissors or small straight cutters appear intermittently in the dominant hand to trim tails once a knot is secured. Wound edges remain well approximated with minimal gapping, and the operator’s actions concentrate on knot security rather than new tissue bites.

60–120 seconds (60.0–119.0 s)
The middle segment of the clip shows a return to active needle passes interleaved with knot tightening. The operator resumes controlled needle arcs through the near edge with the left forceps everting and elevating tissue margin to ensure a superficial dermal bite. Needle grips vary between mid‑shaft and a more distal/short working grip depending on the required control for entry and exit, but the intended result remains consistent: capture of skin/dermal material just adjacent to the wound edge to produce a precise interrupted closure. Needle passage patterns are repetitive and methodical, often moving from superior to inferior positions along the slit, and the non-dominant hand is constantly used to align the opposing edge and to hold suture tails while the driver advances the needle. The operator shows predictable coordination: right hand drives; left hand presents and stabilizes.

120–180 seconds (120.0–179.0 s)
As the repair progresses toward the central cluster of knots, the operator concentrates suturing activity in the central segment of the slit where several existing stitches converge. Multiple frames capture needle passes immediately adjacent to previously placed loops — new bites are taken between existing stitches to produce an even spacing and to reinforce closure integrity. Throughout these frames the needle driver often approaches at a perpendicular axis to the wound for secure penetration, then follows a gentle rotation to exit the opposite edge. The forceps use is nuanced: sometimes they pinch a small amount of dermis to evert the margin and sometimes they grasp the suture tail for management. The left thumb occasionally serves as a stabilizing support on the pad while the right hand alternates between needle driving and holding small scissors for trimming. At times, the needle is briefly held near the swaged end to facilitate a short, controlled pass; at other times the grasp is mid-shaft to execute a larger arc. Despite these minor variations in grip, the overall technique remains that of sequential simple interrupted bites being placed and secured along the same incision.

180–240 seconds (180.0–239.0 s)
Midway through the procedure the operator expands the repair, adding additional interrupted sutures along both central and more cephalad/caudal positions on the same slit. Frames show the needle being passed carefully through the tissue close to the epidermal margin and then the suture being drawn through so the edges sit in close apposition with slight eversion at the bite sites. The left hand frequently anchors suture tails inferior to the wound while the right hand rotates and advances the needle. There are recurrent transitions between fresh needle passes and knot-sitting maneuvers: after pulling a suture limb through the tissue, the operator seats the knot by alternating tension, arranges the throws with the driver and forceps in a coordinated fashion, and trims tails as needed. The orientation of approach changes subtly depending on the stitch location — sometimes the driver comes from the upper-right quadrant, sometimes more directly from above — but the relative positions of the two hands remain predictable: driver superior/medial, forceps inferior/lateral.

240–300 seconds (240.0–299.0 s)
During this phase the operator focuses on filling in gaps within the prior stitch series and strengthening the central portion of the closure. Fresh bites are delivered into the next available tissue interval, and the needle is consistently passed through dermal material near the wound margin to limit gaping and to produce slightly everted edges which aid epidermal apposition once knots are tied. Instrument crossings are brief and superficial; the forceps receive and guide the needle tip at times to ensure correct exit angle. The driver often repositions along the shaft to optimize the arc, and the operator alternates between gripping the needle near the tip for fine orientation and mid‑shaft for more forceful advancement. Suture tails accumulate along the lateral margins and the operator intermittently organizes these strands so subsequent knotting is unencumbered.

300–360 seconds (300.0–359.0 s)
Additional interrupted bites are taken in the central region, and the operator’s rhythm of pass-pull-knot-tighten-trim is well established. The driver and forceps maintain a close cooperative distance (often 1–3 cm) during needle transfer and knotting. Some frames describe slight eversion and mattress-style puckering at certain bites, reflecting subtle variations in the bite depth or needle angle; however, the underlying method remains a series of simple interrupted stitches intended to oppose epidermal edges without deep-layer engagement. The operator’s technique demonstrates efficient workflow: after passing the needle and pulling the suture through, the non-dominant hand holds a limb to maintain tension while the dominant hand forms and seats the knot using the driver and forceps as knot-fidelity instruments. Scissors are used promptly to trim tails to tidy the line once knots are stable.

360–420 seconds (360.0–404.0 s)
In the closing phase most activity centers on finishing knots, tensioning remaining loops and trimming tails. The dominant hand frequently occupies the vertical-to-oblique position over the wound to manipulate suture material for final throws and to remove surplus suture length. The left hand continues to act as the stabilizer (anchoring, presenting, and occasionally cutting), except in moments when it is used to receive the needle tip or to tension a strand for a secure final throw. The incision is now lined with multiple neatly tied interrupted sutures, each sitting at near-uniform intervals and producing consistent, slightly everted edge coaptation. Late frames show only tail arrangement and cutting, and the tissue edges remain closely approximated without visible gapping.

Technique characteristics and consistency
Throughout the procedure the chosen interrupted-suture approach is applied consistently. Bites are predominantly superficial dermal/epidermal in depth, focused at or just adjacent to the wound margins to capture sufficient tissue for secure approximation while avoiding unnecessary bulk or deep-layer engagement (the model is a superficial silicone pad and no deeper tissue layers are present). The operator uses a curved, swaged needle for all passes and alternates grips on the needle as needed for control; grips near the mid‑shaft and nearer the swage are both observed. The right-hand needle driver remains the principal manipulating instrument for needle passage and knot formation; the left-hand forceps provide elevation, eversion and suture management. Occasional minor deviations are present: for example, there are frames where the needle is not visible and the activity is limited to knot manipulation and trimming, or frames where a more vertical perpendicular approach produces slightly larger or more everted bites. These are routine, small adaptations rather than departures from the chosen interrupted technique.

Hand-position evolution and spatial relationships
From the outset, the dominant right hand remains the active needle-driving and knot-manipulating partner. It consistently approaches the line from above or from the upper-right quadrant, holding the needle driver over the incision with a near-vertical or oblique axis. The non-dominant left hand is lateral/inferior to the incision, holding forceps that present and stabilize the near edge and manage suture tails. As the repair progresses, the spatial pattern remains fundamentally unchanged: the right hand does the needle work and most of the knotting; the left hand receives, tensions and aligns. The separation between hands stays tight (generally 1–4 cm), enabling precise exchanges and knot security. Occasionally the left hand’s role shifts to trimming with scissors or using the thumb to stabilize the pad, but these are temporary changes within the same bimanual framework.

Progression of the repair line
The repair is executed in a stepwise fashion with successive interrupted stitches placed along the entire length of the central slit. Needle passes and knot tying proceed in a serial manner, filling the wound from one region to the next so that the closure becomes progressively more continuous and secure. Between the insertion of new sutures, the operator consistently organizes, tightens and trims the preceding knots to maintain a clean working field and uniform tension across the closure. Edge apposition improves with each secured stitch; by the end of the video the incision shows uniform coaptation with only minimal eversion and no significant gapping.

Final state
By the final frames the central slit is closed with a series of well-positioned interrupted sutures. Edges are closely approximated with slight eversion at individual bites — an expected result for skin suturing that facilitates epidermal edge alignment and healing. Knots are seated and secure, and suture tails have been trimmed to tidy the repair. No active needle passes continue; instruments are engaged in final suture arrangement and cutting. Overall, the wound exhibits consistent approximation along its length, with an orderly line of interrupted knots that reflect a methodical application of the selected interrupted-suture technique from initial bite placement to final tail trimming.

Summary observation
Over the course of the footage the operator applies a consistent interrupted-suture method to repair the central vertical slit (the middle of three parallel incisions). The workflow is cyclical and disciplined: controlled needle insertion with the right-hand driver, precise tissue presentation and tensioning with the left-hand forceps, followed by secure knot formation and prompt trimming. Slight, routine variations in needle grip, driver angle and stitch eversion occur, but the technique remains uniform and deliberate. The final repair demonstrates secure approximation and clean finish consistent with a series of simple interrupted skin sutures.
