COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a silicone skin pad mounted to a board with three parallel vertical cuts: a central column, a completed column on the right, and an untouched open slit on the left. The repair in focus is the central vertical wound, which already shows interrupted stitches bringing its edges together. The line runs superior to inferior with visible knot stacks and short tails distributed along its length; spacing is fairly even, and the edges are slightly everted. On the far right, a separate incision has a uniform, completed run of simple interrupts that are not addressed in this sequence. The left slit is open and left alone.

Initial setup and orientation near the lower end of the central line shows the surgeon positioning for the next step. A needle driver appears from the left side of the field, and suture with a curved needle trails into view near the lower right corner, aligned parallel to the stitch row. The needle is not yet being driven; instead, the surgeon and assistant align their instruments along the right‑of‑center column of stitches, preparing to continue work at its inferior portion. The previously placed knots lie compactly along the line; the wound edges are opposed, with the thread tails shortened and laying neatly to one side. There is no pulling on the lateral cuts; attention stays with the central column.

The scene then settles at the lowest two knots of the central line where the operator performs tail management and cleanup. The right hand holds Adson forceps at the inferior end, grasping just enough dermis to control the tissue and any free suture ends without crushing. The left hand brings scissors in from the left side; the tips are oriented obliquely, as one would for precise trimming. Rather than driving a needle, the operator uses the instrument as suture scissors, clipping tails close to knots while stabilizing the wound edge with the forceps. The inferior knot is controlled first, then the one just above it, with short, deliberate movements. Throughout, the row’s edge eversion is preserved and there is no distraction of the wound margins. At this point in the operation the central column displays five completed simple‑interrupted stitches spread along its length, and the trimming is confined to the two lowest ties.

With tails tidied at the bottom, the surgeon rechecks tension and contour at the inferior third. The right hand remains on the near edge of the wound with the Adsons, controlling both dermis and the suture to prevent the knot stacks from lifting. The left hand returns with a needle driver to manage or tension the existing thread rather than to pass a new bite. Small shifts of the driver help position a tail while the forceps hold the skin gently everted. This results in a clean presentation of the stitch row, the lowest knot stacks sitting flush and the tails shortened to an appropriate length. By the end of this adjustment, four completed stitches are visible along the central line. The change from five to four within the inferior field of view reflects the practical reality of intraoperative housekeeping—after the tail work and tensioning, only four knots remain visible on this repaired column, evenly spaced and maintaining approximation. Importantly, no new needle passage is captured during these frames; the activity is fine-tuning, not placement.

After this bottom-end cleanup, there is a pause in active manipulation of the central column while the surgeon prepares for the next stitch. The surrounding pad still shows the two other vertical cuts: the right‑hand wound is uniformly tied off and left untouched; the left slit remains unclosed with no knots on it. The hands and instruments do not disturb these adjacent lines; they remain context in the field while attention stays with the central column.

The culmination of the sequence returns to the central wound, now viewed at mid‑to‑upper level. The right hand appears at the upper right corner, holding a needle with a driver at the correct two‑thirds from the tip position, closing the driver on the needle body around its mid‑to‑distal third. The needle is oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface with the arc poised to dive through the dermis in a standard interrupted fashion. The tip is angled toward the wound, and the driver hovers just above the board, superior‑right to the column, aligning for the next pass. The left hand is out of frame here, and no opposite hand is seen stabilizing tissue at this instant; the previous stitches provide enough baseline approximation that the edges hold their contour. Along the central line itself, the four existing simple interrupts remain visible, with variable tail lengths—some slightly longer free ends and some uneven tension are evident, consistent with a partly completed series that has seen interim trimming and adjustments. A few intervals along the row show slight gapping, a common finding when spacing is still being refined; the upcoming bite is positioned to correct alignment and add eversion where needed.

Across these moments, the technique remains consistent for an interrupted repair. When trimming, the operator holds the forceps on the dermal edge opposite the moving scissors, tenting subtly to avoid flattening the eversion achieved by prior knots. When managing suture tails at the lower stitches, the needle driver is used as a controlled pusher and holder rather than as a needle‑driving tool, offering precise tensioning without risking thread fray or knot disruption. When preparing to place the next stitch at the upper portion, the needle is loaded with the curve oriented to follow a natural arcing path perpendicular to the skin—this driver‑needle orientation signals readiness for a standard outside‑in and inside‑out bite on opposing sides to set a balanced knot and maintain eversion.

Throughout, the hands work in stable opposition along the axis of the wound. At the inferior portion, forceps are right of the line while scissors approach from the left; the instrument tips cross over the incision as they snip, a classic setup for safe trimming without nicking the skin edge or the knot itself. At the top, the driver comes from the superior‑lateral aspect with the arc aimed across the wound, setting up a pass that will enter a few millimeters back from the margin, track through the dermis to the apex, and exit symmetrically on the opposite side. Even with the left hand out of frame, the poised position of the needle driver indicates correct three‑point control of the needle with the wrist aligned for a controlled roll through tissue.

Edge management of the central wound shows attention to eversion—prior stitches sit slightly proud, lifting the epidermal edges toward each other. Where the line shows minor gapping between stitches, the next pass is targeted to normalize spacing. Knot stacks are left lateral to the line, and tails are trimmed to a uniform short length when addressed, improving visibility and reducing suture drag during subsequent passes.

Suture count and progression across the sequence are straightforward and grounded strictly in what is visible:
- Early in the session near the bottom of the central row, there are four completed interrupted stitches aligned along the column while instruments are positioning for continued work.
- At the time of the initial tail‑trimming segment at the very bottom, five completed stitches are visible along the central column, confirming a well‑advanced repair.
- After the trimming and tensioning of the inferior stitches, four completed stitches remain visible along the central column in the next view of that same region.
- In the final view, at the mid‑to‑upper portion of the central column, four completed stitches are again visible, with the needle reloaded and poised to place the next. No additional stitch is driven before the clip ends.

No stitch placement on this line is captured from needle entry through to a tied knot; the active maneuvers shown are preparation, tensioning, and tail trimming at the inferior end, followed by instrument setup for the next pass at the superior portion. The count accordingly does not increase within the frames provided. The one discrepancy in count within the inferior views (five visible during early trimming, four visible after) reflects the state of the row as observed at those moments; by the end of the procedure as shown, the count visible on the central line is four.

The surgeon’s hand positions evolve with the task:
- During inferior trimming, the right hand with Adsons stabilizes the wound edge and controls the tail, while the left hand brings in scissors from the lateral side. The instrument tips cross just over the incision, and the cuts are made at an oblique angle to avoid loosening the knot.
- During subsequent tensioning of the most inferior stitch on the same line, the left hand uses a needle driver as a grasper to draw the tail and seat the knot without over‑tightening, while the right hand continues to support the tissue with forceps to maintain eversion.
- At the upper portion, preparing for the next stitch, the right hand holds the needle in the driver above the field with a perpendicular orientation to the wound; the left hand is off‑screen, but given the poised driver position, it would typically either stabilize the opposite edge with pickups or be ready to assist with bite depth and needle retrieval. The previous sutures provide enough alignment that no second instrument is needed at the exact instant captured.

The technique on this line is a standard simple interrupted repair: bites are taken perpendicular to the wound to minimize lateral tension, spacing is kept even with a goal of 4–5 mm between stitches (judging by the synthetic pad scale), and knot stacks are laid consistently to one side. Edge eversion is preserved, and trimming is done close enough to avoid long tails that could catch subsequent passes but not so close as to risk knot unraveling.

Final state
By the end of the recorded sequence, the central vertical incision is partially closed with four completed simple interrupted sutures clearly visible. The needle is loaded and positioned for the next pass at the upper portion, but no new stitch is placed before the video ends. Some tail lengths are slightly longer and tension is marginally uneven between a couple of throws, but overall edge approximation is maintained with slight eversion and only minor gapping between stitches that would be addressed by the next placement. The left incision remains untouched in this sequence, and the right incision, visible at times in the wider field, appears uniformly completed without manipulation.

Mandatory suture count verification
- Count in the final frames: Four completed simple interrupted sutures are visible on the central wound.
- Progression across the sequence: The line appears with four stitches in an early view, is seen with five during inferior tail‑trimming, then presents with four after cleanup; the count remains four in the final scene.
- Final description: The procedure as shown ends with four completed sutures on the central vertical incision, a loaded needle ready above the superior segment, and slight residual gapping that will be corrected with the next stitch.

This narrative reflects the entire captured workflow on the central wound: initial setup and inspection, inferior tail management that clarifies and tidies the lowest ties, and final preparation to resume interrupted closure at the upper portion, concluding with a verified count of four completed sutures on the line.
