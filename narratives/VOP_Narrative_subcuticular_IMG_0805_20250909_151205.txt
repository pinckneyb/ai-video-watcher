COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence opens on a practice skin pad with three vertical incisions visible: a central column that already carries multiple knots from a separate closure, a smaller slit on the right that remains untouched throughout, and, most importantly, a longer vertical laceration on the left that will be closed from end to end. All activity in the recording focuses on that left-hand wound; the central and right wounds appear only as background references that help confirm orientation and progress.

At the outset, the left laceration is gaping along its length, with the inferior third being addressed first. The operator establishes the working corridor by opposing the needle driver and forceps across the wound. The needle is consistently grasped on its proximal third to mid-body, giving a firm, controllable hold that preserves the curvature. In the first moments over the lower third, the needle is presented perpendicular to the skin surface, advanced in a smooth arc through the far dermis and then toward the near dermis while the forceps on the opposite side gently evert and steady the margin. The assisting hand intermittently releases the pickups to manage the free strand when needed, then returns to edge control. No knot is tied in these first clips; the emphasis is on measured entry, controlled exit, and pulling the suture through to set up for tying without strangulating the tissues.

Through the next several passes along the inferior segment, the same disciplined approach is maintained. The forceps lift the near wound edge an even few millimeters from the margin; the driver honors the needle’s curve, advancing in a near-perpendicular axis to avoid shearing the silicone skin. Regrasping of the needle occurs between passes to orient it for retrieval and delivery to the forceps when needed. The suture strand is brought across the wound in a clean arc, deliberately kept out of the field of view except when used to maintain gentle approximation as the needle is exchanged. The visual rhythm is classic for simple interrupted closure: bite, retrieve, pull-through, reset. Despite multiple penetrations shown in these early moments, no knot is definitively seated yet; the surgeon is building the first stitch with careful attention to bite symmetry and edge eversion at the inferior corner.

As the camera returns to the left slit, now with the needle driver still operating from the lateral side and the forceps working medially, there is a crisp, completed pass at the very inferior corner. The thread is drawn through more substantially, but tying is still deferred; this allows the operator to confirm that the exit points mirror the entries across the wound and that the edges are poised to meet without inversion. Scissors briefly enter the field but are not used; their presence signals readiness for trimming later, after knots are secure.

The closure then transitions from this preparatory work into the first definitive knot. The surgeon completes a full simple interrupted stitch and performs instrument ties with the driver and pickups working across the incision. The forceps secure the short end while the driver alternates securing and advancing the standing end through the throws. The hands cross smoothly over the wound as the knot is seated, and the throws are laid with consistent direction to lock the knot and avoid loosening during the final cinch. By the end of this sequence, one completed simple interrupted suture is visible on the left incision. Although the narration in one clip describes this stitch as located at the “upper portion,” subsequent perspectives indicate that the completed knots ultimately occupy the inferior and middle positions first. The most probable explanation is a difference in camera angle and language in that moment; the essential fact is that the first simple interrupted stitch is now secured on the left wound.

Immediately after, the operator resumes placing another stitch at the superior segment of the same wound. The driver, now sometimes in the left hand and sometimes in the right depending on the angle of approach, maintains the same principles: grasp the needle at the proximal third to mid-shaft, keep the tip perpendicular to the skin, take symmetric dermal bites a few millimeters from the margin, and evert the edges with pickups to ensure excellent approximation. In one view, the narration suggests the operator is initiating the “first” stitch, but given the chronology and the presence of a tied stitch already visible earlier, this is best understood as the next stitch in the sequence at a new position along the same wound. No knot is tied in this immediate segment; the suture is pulled through and the line is prepared for tying.

With the camera centered back on the left slit, the field now clearly shows two prior stitches approximating the wound—one lower and one in the middle—while work progresses at the superior end. The surgeon advances the needle across the wound, pulls the strand through, and begins the instrument tie. The forceps control the short end and assist in seating the knot flush to the skin without excessive tension. The hands straddle the incision with the driver positioned on one side and the pickups on the other, maintaining a clear corridor above the wound. The two finished sutures sit just inferior to the working site and hold the wound edges neatly together; they serve as landmarks and support as the final superior stitch is being fashioned. At this point, two completed simple interrupted sutures are definitively present on the left wound, with a new stitch at the top initiated and not yet cut.

As the uppermost stitch progresses, there is a brief moment in which a shot appears to show three completed knots already on the left line. However, the immediate next sequences again show two completed sutures with the superior stitch still being tied and no fresh cut ends at the top. Given the subsequent continuity of events—where the superior stitch is still in progress for several more moments—this earlier impression of three finished knots appears to reflect the angle, cropping, or inclusion of background knots on the central wound that can resemble knots on the active line when viewed obliquely. The later, better-focused views verify that only two are completed at this juncture.

The operator then commits to the superior stitch with a fully driven pass from the lateral (left) edge across to the medial (right) edge. The forceps routinely tent each margin, taking care to evert rather than invert the epidermis, and the needle is delivered through the tissue with the curvature respected to minimize trauma. The passage is completed, the suture is drawn across, and a clean loop is formed over the top of the field in preparation for tying. In one view, only a single inferior knot is clearly seen; moments later, two are again visible. This fluctuation in visibility is a function of field-of-view and hand positioning, not a change in the actual number of sutures.

The tying of the superior stitch is then captured in detail. The left hand, holding the needle driver, alternates between grasping the standing end and advancing throws. The right hand, using pickups, manipulates the short end, positions the knot just above the puncture sites, and provides gentle countertraction to seat the knot at skin level without “strangling” the edges. The driver and pickups cross above the wound during the throws, demonstrating efficient instrument tying mechanics. Although scissors are visible off to the side, no cutting of the top stitch is shown in these moments. Throughout, the two completed sutures inferiorly remain stable, holding the wound line aligned and nicely everted.

In the next view of the same superior position, the driver once again grasps the needle at the proximal third to mid-body, confirming consistent needle control and technique. The needle passes from left to right near the top of the wound, aided by the forceps that alternately lift the near and far edges to guide entry and exit. The suture is drawn through decisively, and the surgeon prepares to complete the tying sequence. Both hands work in direct opposition across the incision, mirroring the earlier stitches, and the spacing of the bites is consistent with the prior two, ensuring even distribution of tension along the line.

The closing moments of the recording show the driver hovering above and just to the right of the wound, reloading the needle perpendicular to the skin in case an additional stitch is needed beyond the current three. The non-driving hand manages the suture tail when it drifts into view, then withdraws. Crucially, the wound now displays three completed interrupted sutures spaced along its length on the left-hand incision. The edges are well approximated with a mild, appropriate eversion at each stitch; there is no evidence of gapping between the knots, and the wound line is straight. The operator is positioning to take another bite at the very top if needed, but within the captured frames, no further pass is completed.

Throughout the case, several constants define the technique. The needle is always oriented roughly perpendicular to the skin on entry, and the driver consistently grasps it at a point that optimizes control without crushing the swage. Forceps are used judiciously to grasp the dermal edge rather than the epidermal surface, minimizing trauma and supporting eversion. Bites appear to be placed a few millimeters from the wound margin with mirror symmetry on the opposite side. When tying, the surgeon uses instrument ties with deliberate, alternating throws that seat the knot without rocking or over-tightening. The suture strand is kept organized—arched superiorly or off to the side—and the working corridor is maintained by keeping the driver and pickups opposed across the wound rather than crowding the same side. When scissors appear, they are staged for trimming but are not used to cut within the recorded tying sequences until the very end, and even then the actual cutting of the final superior stitch is not shown.

There are also a few momentary discrepancies in the depictions that are best explained by camera angle and cropping rather than any change in the underlying process. At one point an early sequence identifies a newly tied stitch as being at the “upper portion,” while later wide views clearly show two completed stitches occupying the middle and inferior positions first. At another point, a clip suggests three stitches are already present when the subsequent, more stable view shows two with the third still in progress. Finally, one brief view shows only a single inferior stitch when moments later two are again evident. These short-lived differences do not reflect changes to the wound; they represent vantage and framing. Across the full chronology, the technique remains consistent and the closure proceeds methodically along the same left-hand incision.

Hand positioning evolves naturally as the surgeon adapts to the topography of the wound and the direction of travel. Early on, the driver often works from the lateral (left) side while the pickups support the medial (right) edge; later, the hands occasionally switch roles for better angles at the superior end. During tying, the hands cross over the wound, with the driver controlling the long end and the pickups managing the short end to cinch the knot directly down to the surface. The suture tail is intermittently managed by the assisting hand to prevent tangling. The instruments always oppose each other across the wound, preserving a clear line of sight and preventing crowding of the puncture sites.

Most importantly, the progression of stitches on the left incision is coherent and cumulative:

- At the start, there are zero completed sutures. Multiple passes are shown at the inferior third to prepare the first stitch.

- The first completed simple interrupted knot is then tied and seated, establishing the initial point of closure.

- After additional passes and retrievals, a second simple interrupted stitch is completed, so that two finished sutures are now visible approximating the inferior and middle portions of the wound.

- Work continues at the superior end; the superior stitch is passed, pulled through, and tied over several sequences, with scissors occasionally appearing but not cutting until the tying is settled.

- In the final view, three completed interrupted sutures are visible along the left incision. The driver is reloading to take another bite if necessary, but no further stitch is placed within the recorded frames.

Mandatory suture count verification: The procedure ends with exactly three completed sutures on the left vertical incision. The count increases from 0 to 1 when the first knot is tied, then to 2 as the next stitch is completed, and finally to 3 after the superior stitch is passed and secured. The final state shows three evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures holding the left wound edges together with appropriate eversion; the central incision’s pre-existing knots and the right-hand slit remain untouched throughout.

In summary, the recording captures a straightforward series of simple interrupted skin sutures used to close the left vertical laceration on a simulator pad. The operator honors the fundamentals—perpendicular needle entry, symmetric dermal bites, controlled eversion, organized strand management, and methodical instrument ties—while advancing from the inferior portion of the wound toward the superior end. Despite brief camera-angle discrepancies in how some frames label position or momentarily show differing numbers of knots, the overall continuity is clear: the same left-hand wound is closed sequentially, and the session concludes with three completed interrupted sutures neatly approximating that incision.
