COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on a single wound: the rightmost of three parallel vertical incisions on a synthetic skin pad, positioned close to the pad’s right edge. From the very first moments to the conclusion, all activity remains focused on this one slit. The two central lines are consistently avoided, serving only as background landmarks as the operator methodically closes the right-side incision from its inferior end upward, using the same technique throughout. Where brief moments might suggest a different pattern, the operator’s overall sequence of needle passage, knot tying, tail management, and repositioning remain consistent with the selected technique, and any appearance to the contrary is resolved by the way each stitch is individually secured and trimmed before moving on.

The work begins at the lower third of the rightmost incision. The right hand uses Adson forceps to gently pick up the near (right) wound edge, everting it to present a robust dermal bite site. Opposite this, the left hand positions a needle driver above the lower half of the wound, gripping the curved needle about two-thirds from the tip. The needle is oriented perpendicular to the skin surface, with the curve aimed leftward across the gap. With a controlled, near-vertical approach, the left hand advances the needle tip into the right side at approximately 90 degrees and follows the curvature through the dermis toward the center of the incision. The suture material trails smoothly behind, indicating the initiation of the first stitch on this line.

Momentum carries forward as the same wound segment remains in view. Roles briefly switch hand-to-hand: the right hand now holds the needle driver while the left returns with pickups to stabilize tissue. The needle is regrasped around the proximal third to mid-shaft so its arc can be driven cleanly through the tissue. The left forceps help align the far (medial/left) edge, and the driver rotates the needle across the incision in a controlled arc. Once the needle exits the far edge, the strand is pulled through, setting up for knot formation. Hand coordination tightens. The driver and forceps converge centrally to square the knot over the wound, and an instrument tie is completed at the lower end of the line. A small knot cluster with short tails is visible at the inferior pole, establishing a secure anchor that marks the first completed stitch of the series.

With the base established, the operator immediately prepares the next placement just superior to this knot. The left hand resumes control of the driver while the right hand works with forceps along the right (near) wound edge. The needle is held at its proximal third, perpendicular to the skin and to the incision line. The right edge is gently lifted by the pickups, everting the epidermis and dermis to present a full-thickness dermal bite at an appropriate distance from the margin. The driver advances the needle through the near edge, then the instrument regrips and uses a smooth, rotating motion to carry the needle across to the far edge with matching bite depth and distance. This balanced entry and exit sets up good approximation and eversion when tension is applied. The suture is drawn through; then, rather than immediately advancing the needle to a new site, the left hand uses the driver as a tying instrument. The right hand, still on the forceps, transitions to control the free end. Together, the hands throw and snug a series of instrument ties, keeping the knot centered over the gap with edges approximated but not strangled. No new needle passes occur during this tying sequence—this step is all about securing the stitch just placed.

At the same lower region, a brief interlude of housekeeping follows. The left hand, holding the driver/scissor combination, trims the knot tails to a neat length while the right-hand forceps stabilize the tissue and control the free strand. This keeps the field uncluttered and prevents tangling as the work proceeds upward. Once the knot is trimmed, the right hand brings a fresh needle–suture into the field. The left driver approaches to grasp the needle near its mid-body, angling it perpendicular to the skin in preparation for the next bite just above the last.

Moving into the mid-lower segment of the incision, the right hand now holds the needle driver and the left hand the pickups, confirming that the operator is comfortable alternating hands as needed to maintain optimal angles. The left forceps pick up the near edge; the needle tip is aligned to enter the everted tissue, following the curve across toward the far side. This is again a classic perpendicular approach with the needle clamped at the proximal third, ensuring the tip leads and the body follows through a true arc. The strand lies across the field, ready to be drawn through once the bite is completed. Even when the segment does not show tying, the pattern is clear: one stitch at a time, with precise entry and exit points, ensuring symmetric tissue capture.

As the work transitions to the upper-middle of the incision, the setup repeats. The left hand holds the driver above the upper-middle segment; the right hand manipulates forceps at the near edge and occasionally manages the suture strand. The needle is secured two-thirds from the tip or at the proximal third, maintaining a perpendicular orientation; the right-hand pickups tent the right edge to evert the dermis. The needle is driven right-to-left across the slit, and the far edge is guided to accept the needle tip as it emerges. The suture is pulled through, and the operator prepares for another knot. In this sequence and those that follow, the suture tails from earlier stitches are visible mid-lower on the line, reflecting a steadily progressing closure.

Continuity continues along the same wound. With several stitches now present in the lower half, the next stitch is placed just superior to them. The driver crosses the incision at roughly 60–90 degrees for the pass, and the right-hand forceps are poised at the corresponding exit point to receive and present the needle. After passage, the suture is drawn through and set up for tying. Immediately afterward, another sequence shows the right-hand driver tightening and securing a new stitch around the mid-incision, while the left hand’s pickups stabilize the edges to ensure eversion and alignment as the knot cinches down. The tying action occasionally requires the driver to cross over the incision line to square the knot; the free end is managed to the operator’s right to maintain a tidy field.

With the midline stitches secure, the operator advances toward the superior half of the wound. The right hand remains on the needle holder (red-handled), while the left alternates between forceps for tissue control and scissors for trimming. A stitch is placed at the upper portion: the needle is guided through from one edge to the other with a precise arc, and once the suture is pulled through, instrument ties are performed to lock it in place. The tails are trimmed with scissors, a consistent rhythm of placement, knot, trim, and reload emerging as the technique’s hallmark.

An additional round of tail trimming takes place along the superior-middle region—here the left hand uses scissors while the right stabilizes with the needle holder. Then the right hand re-loads a needle in the driver, and the left picks up forceps again, returning to the familiar sequence: tent the near (right) edge for eversion, drive the needle across, draw the suture through, and prepare to tie. Through these repetitions, bite size and spacing remain conservative and consistent, and the edges are approximated without gapping or strangulation, suggesting reliable tension control.

As the upper third of the incision comes into focus, the left hand takes up the driver, the right hand the pickups. The near-perpendicular orientation of the needle is preserved, and the needle is advanced through the dermal/epidermal layers with the forceps guiding and retrieving the tip. At this point the series of midline stitches provides a stable platform below, ensuring previous approximations remain undisturbed while the operator works at the active upper site. After completing the pass, the suture is pulled through, and the operator begins the tying sequence, occasionally using a second instrument to square and cinch the knot with precision over the center of the wound.

In one tying sequence, both hands hold needle holders simultaneously to perform a precise instrument tie, meeting centrally over the incision to lay down a knot that sits flat and maintains even approximation. This two-instrument technique provides excellent control and helps keep the knot square while minimizing torque on the wound edges. The suture tails are then trimmed to tidy lengths, and the hands separate, readying for the next placement.

At this stage, a small gap remains that the operator evaluates near the lower portion of the line. There is a brief preparatory sequence where the needle driver is positioned just left of the right incision, the tip aimed toward the near (right) edge while the forceps stabilize it. The setup clearly indicates intent to place another stitch, likely to address spacing or to reinforce the lower segment. However, before completing that lower placement, attention returns to the top of the wound, where activity resumes at the superior apex. Here, the right-hand pickups are used to evert the tissue at the apex while the left-hand driver advances the needle and then regrips to complete the pass. The suture is drawn through with traction to bring the apex together, and initial movements toward tying are seen. This approach—considering both polar ends for optimal closure—is consistent with ensuring the wound is evenly approximated at its apices while maintaining uniform spacing between stitches.

As the final series of placements approach, one sequence shows a fluid succession of needle passes and tensioning along the same wound. The left hand (now the driver hand) frequently crosses from left to right, and the right hand alternates between forceps to stabilize the near edge and controlling the free strand to snug previous loops. The needle is consistently clamped at the proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and carried in an arcing motion across the incision. The edges are picked up gently, and each pass brings the sides together with careful tensioning. While the cadence here briefly resembles a continuous progression, the broader context, including the repeated tying and trimming sequences before and after, confirms the operator is maintaining the selected technique one stitch at a time, each throw ultimately secured and set before proceeding.

The final moments show completion tasks at the superior end of the line. The needle driver hovers over the right-side incision with the curved needle held securely, oriented near-perpendicular. The pickups manage the tissue edges and the suture loop to align the final stitch. No deep grasping is seen—this remains a skin-level closure, focusing on eversion and edge alignment. After the last pass is tensioned to position, the needle is set aside in favor of scissors. The left hand introduces scissors just lateral to the wound, and the tails are trimmed to a neat length. With this, the line appears complete: evenly spaced stitches extending from the inferior end—where a knot cluster was first established—to the superior apex, each individually tied and trimmed.

Across the entire sequence, several technique themes remain consistent:

- The work stays exclusively on the rightmost vertical incision. The central and left lines are never engaged, and instruments are consciously kept away from them to preserve a clean working corridor centered on the right-side slit.
- The needle is almost always gripped near the proximal third or around two-thirds from the tip, preserving leverage and ensuring the tip leads. Its orientation is consistently perpendicular to both the skin and wound axis, enabling true rotation through the dermis and predictable exits on the far side.
- Forceps use is delicate and purposeful. The near (right) edge is regularly everted to present consistent bite geometry; the far (left) edge is supported for guided exits. Grasping is at the margin to minimize crush injury, and handling remains at skin level on the synthetic pad.
- Each stitch follows the familiar arc: enter the near edge at a measured distance from the margin, follow the needle’s curve through the tissue, retrieve at a mirrored point on the far edge, draw the suture through, then square, tie, and trim. Instrument ties are repeatedly employed, with occasional use of two needle holders to square the knot and control tension.
- Hand dominance is adaptable. At times the right hand drives the needle with the driver while the left supports with pickups; at other times the left hand drives and the right hand manages tissue and suture. This ambidexterity is used to keep the needle perpendicular to the skin and to maintain short, efficient working distances.
- Spatial discipline is constant. Hands straddle the incision with minimal crossing, only crossing when necessary to retrieve the needle or to square knots. Tensioning pulls are directed to seat knots precisely over the centerline, and the free strand is routinely managed to the operator’s right to avoid fouling the next pass.

By the end of the sequence, the rightmost incision is fully closed along its length. The wound edges are neatly approximated with visible, evenly spaced stitches; the dermal eversion is maintained without excessive blanching, and there is no gapping along the line. The suture tails are trimmed, the needle is controlled and lifted away from the field, and the instruments withdraw, leaving a tidy, secure closure confined to the single incision that was worked from start to finish. Any brief footage that suggested a continuous motion is reconciled by the repeated demonstration of individual tying and trimming steps, confirming that the closure adhered to the selected suturing technique throughout.
