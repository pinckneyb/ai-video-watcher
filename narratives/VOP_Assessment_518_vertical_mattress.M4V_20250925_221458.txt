COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses on a single short horizontal/transverse incision near the upper center of the simulator pad, located immediately above a larger central defect. From the opening frames onward, the operator methodically closes this same superior incision by sequentially placing simple interrupted skin sutures along its length. The work is consistently bimanual: one hand controls a curved swaged needle in a needle driver while the other hand steadies and everts the skin edge with fine toothed forceps (Adson-style), and the two instruments repeatedly approach the wound from opposite sides in close coordination.

At the outset, the surgeon sets up the first stitch at the superior margin of the small transverse incision. The left-side needle driver approaches from the left/upper quadrant and the right hand brings forceps from the right/top. A curved needle is grasped in the driver near the mid‑shaft or slightly proximal, with the convex face oriented to carry a short controlled arc through the epidermis and dermis. The forceps pick up the epidermal edge, producing gentle eversion and stabilizing the tissue. The needle is driven tip-first into the near edge, perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin, and passed through full-thickness superficial dermis without engaging deeper tissue layers. The suture tail is drawn through and held ready for tying. Throughout these early passes the operator keeps movements compact and centered almost directly over the incision; instrument tips remain within a few centimeters of the wound, and the driver and forceps work within a narrow working window so each bite is precise and repeatable.

As the sequence proceeds, the operator repeats the same pattern at an adjacent point on the incision. Hands remain close—typically about one to three centimeters apart—while the driver and forceps alternate roles of approaching from slightly different vectors (sometimes the needle driver comes from the right side, other times from the left or from superior-lateral). The needle is variously grasped at slightly different positions along its curvature from frame to frame—mid‑shaft in some passes, closer to the swage or hub in others—but the principle is constant: a curved needle rotated through the skin by the driver while the forceps lifts and everts the near edge to ensure epidermal apposition when the stitch is completed. The bite depth remains superficial, capturing dermis and epidermis to produce slight eversion at the margin, avoiding deep tissue traction.

Midway through the video the pattern has become rhythmic. The operator advances the needle through the near edge, then swings the arc to traverse the wound and exit through the opposite margin. In many frames the nondominant hand also manages the suture tail after passage, keeping it taut and positioned for prompt knot tying. Occasional grip adjustments of the needle driver are observed between passes—repositioning the driver to optimize the angle of rotation and to maintain control of the curved needle as it negotiates the confined space above the wound. There are brief uses of scissors or an ancillary clamp in some moments to manage suture material, but the dominant workflow remains placing interrupted single stitches, each followed by preparation for knot tying.

Tissue handling throughout is conservative and consistent: the forceps deliver minor traction and eversion, opposing the needle driver which takes short, controlled arcs through the skin simulator. Each bite is placed a few millimeters from the wound edge with the intention of bringing epidermal margins into precise, slightly everted apposition. The operator avoids engaging deep tissue layers; there is no evidence of closure of subcutaneous planes or deep undermining. The synthetic dermatologic model responds predictably—edges approximate with a small eversion at each stitch site.

Hand positions evolve subtly but systematically as closure progresses along the incision. Early frames show the needle driver entering from the left and forceps from the right-top; later frames capture driver approaches from the right or superior-lateral as the surgeon shifts position to address adjacent unclosed portions. Despite these shifts, the hands maintain a disciplined spatial relationship to the wound: they flank the incision and converge over individual bite sites, crossing briefly when necessary to present the needle and to control exit. The nondominant hand frequently moves from stabilizing the near edge to holding the suture tail between thumb and forefinger, then to managing the knot tying process. The dominant hand, controlling the needle driver, sometimes repositions more proximally on the shaft of the needle to complete a tight arc or to change the entry trajectory; these adjustive maneuvers help preserve a consistent bite geometry across the entire line.

Technique-wise, the surgeon maintains a simple interrupted closure throughout. The principles—skin-only bites, slight eversion of edges, perpendicular-to-oblique needle trajectory, mid‑arc rotation of a curved needle—are preserved from the first pass to the last observed stitch. Where there are small inconsistencies in needle grasp (varying from mid‑shaft to near the swage) or in the exact angle of entry, these are adjustments to local anatomy and handling rather than shifts to a different closure method. On a few frames one can note a stitch that appears slightly deeper or shows a mattress-like appearance, but the overall strategy remains placing single interrupted sutures aimed at epidermal apposition; any subtle variations do not fundamentally change the technique being used.

Spatial relationships between instruments and tissue show a high degree of coordination. The needle driver arcs the curved needle across the wound while the forceps present the opposite margin with precise orientation, often eversion, to receive the needle tip. Instrument tips approach the wound from roughly opposing directions and are typically separated by just a few millimeters at the moment of needle passage. The operator repeatedly demonstrates bimanual precision: while one instrument manipulates tissue geometry the other directs needle trajectory so that the suture captures just enough dermis to produce secure, everted approximation without puckering or inversion.

As sutures are added along the incision, previously placed stitches create a horizontal row of tied knots immediately inferior to the working site; these act as visual guides for spacing and tension for subsequent passes. The surgeon places new stitches immediately superior or lateral to that cluster, progressively extending the closure across the incision. After each pass the suture is drawn through, prepared for tying, and the knot is secured—producing small, neat knots with lateral suture tails projecting away from the repair. Later frames show occasional trimming and suture management with scissors, indicating knot completion and suture tail control between bites.

There are brief moments when the field presents limited visual information—instances where no hands or instruments are visible while the stitched repair is shown; these frames simply demonstrate the state of approximation and the appearance of previously tied knots. Such gaps in visual data do not alter the continuity of the procedure: the same incision remains the focus and the same interrupted technique is resumed where the last pass left off.

Toward the close of the sequence, the operator completes the final stitches along the upper transverse incision. Instrument positions become slightly more lateral as the last lateral bites are placed, with the forceps continuing to evert and the driver delivering the needle in controlled arcs until the last passes are pulled through and secured. The finished repair presents a uniform line of interrupted sutures: each stitch approximates the epidermal margins with a subtle eversion, knots sit evenly across the row, and residual suture tails extend laterally from the knots. The overall wound is neatly apposed, with no gross inversion or gaping, and tension appears well distributed along the closure.

Throughout the entire operation the surgeon consistently applies a simple interrupted skin closure technique to the same small transverse incision above the larger defect. Bimanual coordination, conservative dermal bites, repeated controlled needle arcs with a curved needle, and deliberate edge eversion are the hallmarks of the approach. Minor frame-to-frame variations in needle grip, instrument approach vector, and brief moments without visible hands are present but do not disrupt the steady progression of the repair. The result is a tidy, evenly spaced interrupted closure that restores edge-to-edge contact along the incision with slight eversion, secured knots, and managed suture tails—an effective, reproducible skin approximation maintained from the first pass to the final secured stitch.
