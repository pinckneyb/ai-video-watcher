COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on the far‑left incision at its inferior corner. With the wound still completely open, the edges are freshened: forceps lift the corner and a small wedge of synthetic skin is trimmed to square the edge and set up a clean anchor point. The curved needle is then loaded in the holder about two‑thirds from the tip and brought to the area, oriented perpendicular to the skin, but no stitch is placed yet.

Attention shifts to the right‑side incision, which already carries a short row of simple interrupted sutures (about four). Working low on this line, one hand tents the inferior wound edge with forceps while the other repeatedly reloads and positions the needle driver perpendicular to the skin to prepare the next bite. The needle is aligned over the gap but not driven; instruments are repositioned several times at the lower third. A brief attempt to align over a gap near the top follows, with the needle transferred between driver and forceps for positioning, but again no penetration is made before the hands withdraw.

Focus moves to the central incision. Here, the existing row is maintained rather than extended: scissors in the left hand trim knot tails at the inferior end while forceps in the right hand lift the knot for clearance. The same pairing then works along the row, tightening and tidying, without placing additional stitches.

Work then returns to the unsutured far‑left incision to begin closure in earnest. Starting along the lower to mid portion, the needle holder stays lateral to the wound while forceps on the opposite side evert the near (left) lip. The needle is set perpendicular and advanced outside‑in through the dermis of the left edge, following its curvature. These passes establish consistent depth and spacing but stop short of traversing the far edge; the wound remains open without a completed stitch.

The operator then relocates to the superior end of the same left incision and standardizes the first stitch at the corner. With the needle driver again lateral/left and the forceps on the opposing edge, the dermal margins are delicately everted with tip‑to‑tip holds. The needle, grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, enters the left dermal edge at 90 degrees and is rotated along its arc. At the top corner the tip is guided across the gap and out through the right edge; the suture is pulled through, establishing a full‑thickness simple‑interrupted pass, though the knot is not tied yet. Over several exchanges the same corner is refined: at times only the near edge is traversed, at times the tip is guided out of the far dermis, always with the driver and pickups opposing each other across the gap to maintain eversion and control depth. Throughout, bites are a few millimeters from the edge, perpendicular to the skin, with minimal crush on the tissue.

There is a brief detour back to the right‑side incision. The uppermost stitch on that line is tensioned and adjusted, causing local puckering as the knot is secured and tails managed. The hands then move to the distal end of the same right incision to prepare another stitch: forceps evert the edge and the needle is oriented for entry, but no bite is taken before the field changes again.

Returning to the left incision, the superior‑corner pass that had been placed is finally secured. With the needle driver on one side and forceps controlling the suture on the other, the knot is tied as a simple interrupted, drawing the edges together with slight eversion. Scissors enter to trim the tails. This results in the first completed stitch on the far‑left incision, seated at its superior end.

In the final moment, the hand hovers back over the right‑side incision with the curved needle held by the fingers above the superior portion of the line, poised to place another stitch. The right incision remains with its original set of interrupted sutures and gaps awaiting additional closure; no new pass is made in that instant.

Across the procedure, instrument choreography remains consistent: the needle is loaded about two‑thirds from the tip and delivered perpendicular to the skin; one hand stabilizes and everts the target edge with fine pickups while the other advances the needle in controlled arcs. On the left incision, this technique culminates in one completed simple interrupted stitch at the top corner. The central line is maintained by tightening and trimming, and the right line is repeatedly prepared and adjusted but not extended within the observed intervals. Hands and instruments continually oppose each other across whichever wound is in view, meeting over the gap to maintain alignment, depth, and edge eversion as the work advances.
