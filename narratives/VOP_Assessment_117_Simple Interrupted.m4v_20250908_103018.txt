Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion is controlled and reproducible: two-handed needle driving with forceps-assisted exposure, clean 90-degree passes, and immediate transition into alternating instrument ties shows solid choreography. The tying sequences are efficient, with good counter-tension and low tissue lift, and the QA “seating” step reflects situational awareness of knot position and stack height.
