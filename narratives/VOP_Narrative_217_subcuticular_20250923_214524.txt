COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on a single incision: the straight vertical slit along the far right edge of the pad. From start to finish, all instrument work, needle passes, ties, and trimming focus on this one line. The closure begins low at the inferior end near the lower-right corner and progresses upward toward the superior end, with repeated cycles of precise needle placement, instrument ties to secure each pass, and periodic trimming. Throughout, the operator works close to the wound margins, most often using a needle driver in one hand and tissue forceps in the other, and alternates which hand carries which instrument as the situation demands.

Opening moves and anchoring at the inferior end (0–59 s)
The session opens at the inferior tip of the right-edge incision. The wound edges are straight and slightly gaping. The left hand is armed with a needle driver; the right hand with Adson/tissue forceps. The right wound lip at the bottom corner is gently lifted to present the entry site, with care taken to avoid crushing. The curved needle, loaded in the driver at about the mid-to-proximal third, is positioned nearly perpendicular to the skin surface, its arc aligned to move from the operator’s left toward the right wound edge. The first bite is initiated on this right margin. After the needle is advanced and retrieved, the suture is pulled through, and attention immediately shifts to securing the pass. The driver swaps hands to optimize tying: the driver becomes a vertical post near the lower end of the slit while the other hand manipulates the free strand, looping and cinching the first throws down onto the entry/exit points. The first sequence of instrument throws is methodical—loops are formed around the driver post and advanced straight down over the wound, with both hands kept close and parallel to the incision’s axis. Successive frames show continuity of this knot-tying step, with both instruments sometimes engaged—either two needle holders or a driver paired with a hemostat—to control tension and seat the knot centrally. This creates a secure anchor at the distal end before the closure proceeds upward.

Building the next bites at the lower third (60–149 s)
With the distal anchor in place, the operator re-engages the lower third of the same slit to place the next stitch. The left hand again carries the needle driver; the right hand uses forceps to evert and stabilize the right margin. The needle is reloaded near the proximal/middle third, again perpendicular to the skin edge, and the driver adjusts several times to keep the bite perpendicular and precise. The needle is advanced and the suture drawn through. A brief detour to trim a small tag near the lower-right corner with scissors occurs, with the forceps maintaining continuous control of the wound margin; this tidy-up step clears the field and prevents tangles. Returning to suturing, the next bite is taken at the inferior end, again beginning on the right lip. The suture is drawn across the field to create working length, and the needle is reloaded for the subsequent pass along the same incision. As the pass is completed and slack is managed, the operator transitions smoothly into tying. The knot is formed with instrument throws at the lower end, using the driver as a post to square the knot and advance it accurately onto the wound edges. After tying, the needle is reoriented in the driver, curve aligned for the next right-to-left pass across the incision, signaling upward progression.

Progression through the mid-portion (150–209 s)
The work now advances through the mid-length of the slit. The right hand primarily carries the needle driver while the left hand alternates between forceps and assisting instrument. Forceps are used deliberately to evert the right wound edge and present tissue for each entry, maintaining a consistent bite a few millimeters from the edge. The needle is grasped around the proximal third from the swage, and after each passage the driver re-grasps near the tip to pull the needle through smoothly. The suture is drawn across the field, slack is controlled, and the needle is repositioned for the next bite. The cycle is consistent: position and enter at the right margin, draw through, reset, and tie. In places, reloading is shown without immediate penetration—careful setup for an accurate angle is prioritized over speed. Once a pass is complete, instrument tying resumes: loops are made with the driver acting as a post, the free strand is retrieved with the assisting instrument, and throws are seated down carefully over the mid-portion of the wound. The tissue is approximated with gentle tension; eversion is maintained primarily by the entry angle and the initial forceps lift rather than aggressive traction. This sequence demonstrates steady, reproducible technique: interrupted passes placed and secured in order as closure moves up the incision.

Transition into the upper third (210–239 s)
Attention shifts to the upper third of the same right-edge incision. The left hand now often holds the needle driver from a superior/medial approach, while the right hand uses forceps to control the right margin. A pass at the upper portion is completed or very near completion; the strand is drawn through and tensioned, though a knot is not immediately tied in that moment. The driver then releases and re-grips for an efficient hand-off, ensuring the needle remains secure and aligned for the next move. Soon after, the operator completes an instrument tie at this upper segment. The driver crosses left-to-right over the wound functioning as the post; the forceps remain just lateral to the skin edge, retrieving and pulling the free end through each loop. Movements are confined to a few millimeters around the knot site, and throws are alternated to square the knot. This maintains both approximation and knot security at the superior third.

Upper third: initiating and securing additional passes (240–269 s)
With the superior third now active, the operator initiates another stitch at the right edge. The left hand, holding the driver, positions the needle perpendicular to the skin surface; the right hand lifts and everts the right wound edge with forceps to present a clean entry point. The needle is aimed a few millimeters from the margin; at this stage, the pass to the opposite lip is not yet shown, emphasizing careful setup. Immediately after the pass is drawn through, the focus shifts to tying. The driver becomes the tying instrument, forming loops and guiding the knot down at the very top corner of the slit. The left and right hands coordinate closely: the tying hand maintains a stable post while the assisting hand manages the free limb to control the precise seating of each throw directly over the recent exit site. The result is a square, seated knot at the superior corner with minimal disturbance to the tissue.

Repeated placement and tie-down at the superior end (270–299 s)
Another pass is initiated in the upper third with the right hand now carrying the needle driver. In this sequence, forceps are not prominently used for lifting the edge; instead, the operator depends on needle angle and skin tension to maintain eversion and edge control. The right margin is entered from the external surface, and the bite is started; crossing to the opposite side is not shown in that instant. Shortly thereafter, the suture already placed at the superior end is tied down with multiple instrument throws. The driver is used primarily to handle suture rather than to drive the needle, indicating a focus on securing the stitch rather than placing a new one during these frames. The knot is seated adjacent to the wound’s right margin, with the standing part tensioned superiorly and slightly medially to center the knot over the entry/exit site. The approximation at the top appears sound, though the absence of opposing forceps during tie-down could limit fine eversion—an acceptable compromise in a training context, but one noted during this segment.

Final passes, reloading, and trimming (300–322 s)
Near the end of the sequence, the team prepares for yet another pass at the superior portion. The right hand holds the needle driver at the right of the incision; the left hand hovers with fine forceps or a second instrument to assist with re-grasps, needle control near the swage, and loop management. The suture from a previous bite is drawn through and slack removed; the needle is repeatedly re-grasped at approximately two-thirds from the tip to refine the angle for the next entry. Setup and control are deliberate, with both instruments converging over the rightmost incision to maintain precise trajectory and loop control immediately adjacent to the wound margins. The final action in the footage is not a new pass but rather a transition to scissors. The needle is set aside, and the dominant hand brings scissors in to trim a suture tail at the mid-to-upper segment where the recent knot lies. The cut is made carefully, close to the knot while keeping the blades clear of the tissue and the remaining suture line.

Hand use and spatial choreography
Across the entire procedure, hand dominance and instrument roles shift fluidly:

- Early at the inferior end, the left hand frequently serves as the driver hand while the right uses forceps to stabilize and evert the right wound edge. During tying, the driver often becomes a vertical post held by the opposite hand to optimize visibility and the direction of throw advancement.

- In the mid-portion, the right hand more consistently holds the driver while the left alternates between forceps and assisting with suture management. The operator re-grasps the needle near the tip as needed to draw it through and maintain perpendicularity.

- In the upper third, both configurations appear. At times the left hand carries the driver across the wound from a superior/medial angle with the right hand on the forceps; at other times the right hand carries the driver alone with no visible forceps on tissue, relying on needle angle and the inherent tension of the pad to maintain eversion. During ties, the driver acts as the post for instrument throws, and the assisting hand—whether holding forceps or another driver—retrieves the free limb and advances each throw down in a controlled manner.

Throughout, the instruments remain tightly clustered around the right-edge incision, aligned parallel to the wound’s long axis, and move only as far as needed to manage loops, retrieve the free strand, and seat knots. The suture line arcs diagonally across the field at times when slack is being drawn through, but is always brought back directly over the wound for final tie-down.

Technical features and consistency of the chosen method
The chosen technique is applied consistently: individual passes are taken, the suture is pulled through, and the stitch is secured with instrument ties before moving on. The needle is typically gripped at the mid-to-proximal third (about two-thirds from the tip) and presented perpendicular to the skin. The right wound edge is most often the entry side; eversion is facilitated either by a gentle lift with forceps or by the angle of entry itself. The operator takes care to avoid crushing the tissue, using the forceps tips for presentation, and to keep bites at a measured distance from the edge. Knots are squared by alternating throws, seated under direct visualization right over the entry/exit points. At times, a short trimming step is performed to remove tags and prevent clutter near the working corner.

Occasional deviations or economy-of-movement choices are noted—most notably, sequences where no forceps assist during tie-down or where the driver alone sets the knot—with potential minor tradeoffs in the degree of eversion during knot seating. Nevertheless, the overall approach remains controlled and consistent, with careful attention to perpendicular entry, loop control, and accurate knot placement.

Closure progression from bottom to top
The narrative of closure is clear. It begins at the bottom of the right-edge slit with a first bite and anchor knot. Subsequent stitches are placed progressively upward along the same slit. Each stitch cycle follows the same cadence: precise setup on the right margin, needle passage and retrieval, suture drawn through, and secure instrument tie-down. This pattern is repeated through the lower third, then through the mid-portion, and finally into the superior third. In the uppermost segment, a series of placements and ties continue, with adjustments in hand dominance and assistance as the operator works near the corner. Periodic trimming removes extraneous tails near the working area to maintain a neat field.

Final state
By the end of the footage, the superior portion shows a newly secured knot with the tail trimmed, and the mid-to-upper segments appear approximated at the sites where ties were seated. The lower segment has already been anchored and tied earlier. Along the length that has been addressed, the wound edges are brought together under even tension, with knots centered over their respective entry/exit points. The sequence concludes with good approximation at the most recently treated upper segment and a cleanly trimmed tail, indicating a ready field for any further passes above or signaling practical completion of the visible closure in this segment.

In sum, the procedure demonstrates a deliberate, stepwise interrupted closure performed entirely on the single right-edge incision. The operator starts at the inferior end, anchors, then advances stitch-by-stitch up the slit. Each stitch is placed with perpendicular needle orientation, the right margin is reliably presented with forceps when used, and each pass is secured with a careful instrument tie. Hand roles are adapted to optimize control depending on location and task—driving, tying, or trimming—while spatial relationships remain tight and parallel to the wound. The final view shows a neatly tied and trimmed knot near the superior end with the addressed segments of the wound well approximated.
