COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with a short vertical skin defect on the synthetic practice pad, situated slightly to the right of the tray center and immediately medial to an already-completed row of interrupted sutures. At the outset this vertical slit measures roughly 1.5–3 cm depending on the frame series, with clean, sharp edges and a small degree of undermining in some frames. The operator works alone, using both gloved hands throughout: one hand controlling a ringed, gold-handled needle driver (occasionally exchanged for a different needle-holder or straight forceps), and the opposite hand manipulating fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson-style) or, in some moments, a curved clamp or scissors used for suture management. The hands remain close to the wound during the entire sequence, typically within a few centimeters of each other to maximize control of needle trajectory and tissue approximation.

Initial passes and exposure (0.0–44.0 s)
From the first frames the technique is deliberate and repetitive. The needle driver grasps a curved surgical needle near the mid-shaft or just proximal to the swage; this positioning gives precise control of the needle arc. The curvature is consistently oriented to carry the tip from the near edge into the far edge in a controlled circular motion. The non-dominant forceps tents, everts, and stabilizes the opposing skin margin, creating a small, exposed target to receive the needle. Passes are made either perpendicular-to-oblique or oblique-to-surface, depending on approach angle, but the operator consistently aims to take small, symmetric bites through the superficial-to-mid dermis so the epidermal edges evert slightly and the dermis is closely approximated.

Throughout these early moments the operator places additional interrupted stitches immediately medial to the pre-existing row; the fresh suture material is drawn through and manipulated with the forceps to allow knot formation. The needle is driven with a rotational wrist motion—the needle driver rotates the shaft while the forceps present and stabilize tissue—so that the needle tip exits cleanly on the opposing lip. These first bites set the pattern for the remainder of the case: short bite distances close to the wound margin, modest eversion, atraumatic handling, and careful control of suture tension.

Sequential placement and tightening (45.0–119.0 s)
As the sequence progresses the operator continues to add stitches in a sequential, methodical fashion working along the incision from one end toward the other (frames show activity at both superior and inferior ends in different passes). After each needle pass the thread is drawn through, tensioned to approximate the edges, and a knot-tying sequence follows. Tying is accomplished with instrument technique: the needle driver and forceps are used in concert to form and secure throws. A gold-handled hemostat or needle holder is occasionally used to hold the suture tails or to back up knot throws. Long suture tails are visible between passes and are managed with a pair of scissors or clamp as needed.

Needle handling remains consistent — the driver often grasps the needle near the shaft to control curvature and depth of bite, and the tip is inserted at an oblique angle into the dermis to capture a shallow-to-intermediate tissue bite. The operator maintains symmetric dermal bites so that the epidermal edges meet neatly without puckering. Forceps are repeatedly used to evert the epidermis slightly before each pass to ensure the visible skin surface sits proud when tensioned, which will yield an eversion desirable for healing.

Mid-procedure adjustments and role alternation (120.0–194.0 s)
Midway through the recording, small variations in hand approach and instrument choice appear but the underlying method remains constant. Sometimes the left hand holds the needle driver while the right hand holds forceps; in other frames those roles reverse. At times the operator uses their fingers to steady or press the wound edges when fine forceps are not required. Needle grips vary slightly — occasionally closer to the hub, other times mid-shaft — but always to optimize control and needle arc for that particular bite.

Tissue interaction in this phase is careful: the forceps lift and align edges, bites remain limited to the dermal layer of the synthetic pad, and the operator avoids excessive traction or clamping that might invert the margins. When undermined edges are encountered the tissue is engaged in a controlled manner, and the bites are adjusted to take purchase on sound dermis without undue superficial tension. Each stitch is pulled snug to approximate tissue but not so tight as to cause blanching or torsion of the wound edge.

Working toward the superior and proximal ends (195.0–269.0 s)
As the operator proceeds, stitches are added sequentially toward non-sutured portions of the incision. When working at the superior and proximal aspects the instrument approach vectors are slightly altered: the needle driver often comes from a lower-left or lateral vector while the forceps approach from an upper-right or medial vector so their tips converge at the bite point. This crossing of instruments is brief and controlled, enabling precise transfer of the needle tip through tissue and timely retrieval by the opposing instrument. In several frames a ringed instrument held in the left hand is seen transversely across the wound to assist in tensioning and knot security.

The suture progression follows a one-at-a-time rhythm: needle pass, pull-through, adjust tension, form throws with the needle driver and forceps, then cut or reposition tails before the next pass. On several occasions the operator leaves long tails and momentarily steps away from a newly tied knot to place the next stitch more proximally, indicating working in a staggered fashion that preserves spacing and alignment across the entire incision. The spacing remains consistent with the previously completed row on the lateral side, producing an orderly parallel pattern.

Later passes, finishing and refinement (270.0–342.0 s)
Toward the later frames the operator is seen placing final stitches near the superior-most and mid-proximal areas, finishing the sequence of interrupted sutures across the whole defect. Needles are still grasped mid-shaft with curvature directed to pass tip-first across the gap; forceps repeatedly evert edges and present them for the needle, and occasional small adjustments are made to approximate dermal edges. Slight variability in bite depth occurs depending on local tissue thickness, but the operator consistently aims for superficial-to-mid dermal purchase so that the epidermis meets without folding inward.

Knot-tying remains instrument-based and efficient. After each knot is secured, excess suture is trimmed with scissors when visible. When necessary, the operator uses an additional clamp or hemostat to hold suture tails during the tying sequence. The synthetic tissue shows modest eversion at each suture site once tensioned, and the overall row takes on a uniform appearance that mirrors the completed stitches already present lateral to the wound.

Technique characteristics and evolution
From start to finish the technique demonstrates disciplined, repeatable execution of interrupted single-bite skin sutures. Key characteristics remain constant: the use of a curved needle, controlled mid-shaft grips for precise curvature control, small symmetric dermal bites close to the wound edge, slight epidermal eversion, and atraumatic tissue handling with fine toothed forceps. There is no evidence of large, deep undermining closures or buried-layer work; the focus is on simple interrupted approximation of the skin edges.

Where the technique evolves is primarily in ergonomics and minor instrument alternation. Early frames show the operator finding the best approach vectors and exchange of instruments; as the sequence continues the movements become more economical and confident. Hand positions settle into a steady pattern of close bilateral control: one instrument delivering the needle from a lateral or inferior vector, the other presenting tissue from a medial or superior vector, with occasional brief crossings to facilitate needle transfer and knot formation. The operator sometimes swaps which hand holds the driver versus forceps, but these switches are seamless and do not disrupt the suture pattern.

Hand position dynamics and spatial relationships
Hands remain tightly coordinated directly over the incision throughout. Typical separation between hand bases is small (approximately 1–6 cm depending on frame), emphasizing fine motor control. Instruments converge at the bite point, often at shallow angles (30–45°) to each other, which allows the driver to pass the needle with precision while the forceps steady tissue. Approaches vary with the location along the incision being addressed: inferior and lateral passes favor a left-hand driver with a right-hand forceps approach, while superior passes occasionally reverse or adjust this orientation for better needle trajectory. Despite these variations the relative relationship—one instrument delivering the needle, the other presenting tissue—remains constant.

Interaction with the previously completed row
Throughout the case the completed row of interrupted sutures to the right serves as a visual and mechanical reference for spacing and eversion. New stitches are placed immediately medial to that row, matching bite distance and suture orientation so that the finished closure appears orderly and uniform across the entire wound. The operator uses the existing sutures to guide spacing and to maintain consistent tension across the defect, ensuring that the new stitches integrate smoothly with the older ones.

Final state of the closure
By the end of the procedure the previously open vertical slit is closed with a continuous sequence of closely spaced interrupted stitches. Each knot is secured and excess suture trimmed when appropriate. The dermal edges are approximated with slight, intentional eversion, and no gross bunching or inversion is evident. The overall line shows regular spacing, uniform bite depth consistent with superficial-to-mid dermal capture, and atraumatic handling without evidence of tearing or crush injury to the synthetic tissue. The finished appearance matches the style and spacing of the original lateral row, resulting in a neat, evenly approximated skin closure that reflects consistent, deliberate interrupted suturing technique from first pass to final knot.

Throughout the case the operator maintains precise control of needle curvature and trajectory, uses fine forceps to present and evert tissue, alternates instruments when ergonomically beneficial, and methodically builds the closure stitch-by-stitch to achieve a symmetric, eversion-preserving repair. Minor variations in grip and approach are present but do not alter the fundamental technique or the tidy, reproducible final result.
