COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds around a single vertical skin incision on the left side of a multi‑incision training pad. At the outset, this wound presents as a short, gaping slit low in the left field; as the work progresses and the camera or hands reposition, the same line appears more left‑central and extends cranially. No other incisions are actively manipulated during the sequence; they remain visibly untouched while this one line is closed progressively from its inferior portion toward the superior end using simple interrupted sutures tied instrumentally.

The opening moments show careful setup for the first tissue bite at the inferior end of the wound. The left hand controls a needle driver on the left side of the slit with the curved needle grasped roughly two‑thirds from its tip, oriented perpendicular to the pad surface to favor an even, rotational pass. The right hand, holding fine tissue forceps, stabilizes and lightly everts the near edge to define an accurate entry point while keeping the far edge free of undue traction. With the edge presented, the driver advances the needle in a controlled arc, the tip poised at the left margin near the lower third. Both instruments straddle the slit closely, working within a few millimeters of the wound edge to ensure bite depth is appropriate and perpendicular to the skin.

As the needle advances (the field still centered on the inferior third), instrument roles begin to alternate. The driver maintains its position on the left of the slit while the forceps switch sides to capture and guide the needle on its way out from the far edge. This controlled handoff preserves the curvature of the pass and prevents wobble. By the end of this initial pass, the needle has traversed both edges symmetrically and is released from the driver to allow the suture to be pulled through, leaving a long strand ready for tying. The needle itself is kept off to the side once the strand is seated through the tissue.

With the first pass through tissue complete, attention turns to knot security at the inferior end. The right hand takes the lead performing instrument ties over the incision while the left hand holds the driver to manipulate the suture as the tying instrument and to help snug the knot flush to the skin. The needle is not used again at this point; instead, the driver forms successive throws around a stationary post and draws each loop down carefully. The left hand intermittently brings in a second instrument to act as the post—holding the short end near the wound—while the right‑hand driver wraps and transports the long limb. Throughout, the knot is guided precisely to the surface at the stitch entry/exit points, cinching the edges together without crushing the tissue or twisting the line. The edges approximate at the inferior portion, and the operator tightens or repositions the throws as needed by drawing slack through the knot, then the instruments withdraw briefly as the throw sets.

With that stitch seated, the line progresses just superior to the first knot. The left hand again takes the driver while the right hand adopts forceps, reverting to a two‑handed bite placement routine. The curved needle is grasped on its body with the curvature oriented for a near‑perpendicular entry, and the right‑hand forceps alternately evert first the near and then the far lip to stabilize each margin during passage. The operator is careful with bite spacing and depth, choosing symmetric dermal purchase on both sides to promote even approximation and a slight eversion. After the pass, the suture is drawn through without dragging the dermal surface, leaving adequate length for an instrument tie.

Knot formation on this new pass is done with the needle holder as the tying instrument. The holder is positioned just above the wound while the free (long) end is managed by the opposite hand. The long strand is looped around the jaws, the short tail is grasped, and the throw is transported down to seat the knot directly over the incision line. Multiple throws are placed sequentially, alternating directions to ensure security. The needle itself remains parked well away from the tissue to avoid inadvertent injury while tying. Once snug, gentle lateral tension is applied by the non‑driver hand to cinch each throw flush to the skin. The technical cadence is consistent: loop, grasp, slide, and seat, maintaining a low profile knot and preserving tissue approximation.

As this lower segment is secured, the team trims the tails. The left hand briefly brings in scissors from the superior‑left, while the other hand stabilizes one limb of the suture near the knot with forceps. Blade tips approach perpendicularly to the tail, allowing a controlled cut just above the knot, and then both instruments withdraw, leaving a neatly secured stitch with short tails. This confirms the bottom of the wound is closed and stable without gapping.

The work then advances cranially along the same vertical line. A new pass is initiated for the next stitch within the same slit, guided by the same principles: the driver, now in the right hand for this sequence, holds the needle approximately one‑third from the swage with the curve oriented perpendicular to the pad. The left hand brings in tissue forceps to evert the edge and, at times, to steady the needle tip for a handoff. The pass is completed through both edges with a consistent arc, and the suture is drawn through. Knot tying follows promptly at the superior portion of this short segment: the left hand now uses the driver primarily for instrument ties while the right hand manages the free end to maintain tension. Multiple alternating throws are advanced and snugged down directly over the incision, and then the tails are trimmed. By the time this sequence concludes, the lower portion of the wound bears several well‑seated simple interrupted stitches with slight, desirable eversion and controlled tail length.

The field perspective shifts upward along the same vertical cut, which now appears left‑central in the frame as the operator closes the wound in a superior direction. Midway up, several previously placed simple interrupted sutures are already in place along the lower half. Work is focused near the superior third of this same incision. The driver, immediately to the right of the wound, controls the suture strand to finish a knot that has just been placed; the needle is held but not driven during these frames, indicating the pass occurred just beforehand. The edges are already approximated, and the operator cinches the knot carefully, then introduces scissors from the left to trim the tails. Hands briefly cross during trimming, then pull away. The wound edges remain approximated without new bites taken in that moment.

Continuing upward, another new stitch is initiated near the superior portion of the line. The tissue forceps, appearing from the upper right, elevate and evert the target edge, while the driver positions the needle perpendicular to the skin surface. The tip enters just back from the margin at the intended bite site, with care to keep bites symmetric. The arc traverses the near edge and exits the far side in a controlled fashion. The suture is drawn laterally to seat the pass, and the setup for knot tying begins. With the pass completed, the driver adopts its tying role, grasping the standing part close to the wound while the other hand manages the free end off to the patient’s right. Instrument ties are performed over the top of the incision, the needle remaining parked to avoid injury. The knot is tightened directly over the wound gap, converting that pass into another secured simple interrupted stitch.

In short order, the scissors return to trim the newly secured knot tails at the topmost stitch. The needle holder remains adjacent and parallel to the incision’s upper segment during cutting, acting as a stabilizer while the scissors approach perpendicular to the tail for a precise cut. The instruments then move away, leaving the upper portion cleanly trimmed and the wound undisturbed.

Work proceeds to the next small gap at the superior end. The left hand holds the needle driver with a loaded curved needle, bringing it in lateral to the left wound edge. On the right side, tissue forceps elevate the right margin to present a stable target with slight eversion. The driver orients the needle perpendicular to the pad and begins a standard forehand pass through the left edge. The bite is targeted a few millimeters from the margin to capture adequate dermis, and the curvature is respected to avoid undue shear. Depending on needle position, the right‑hand forceps may briefly grasp the needle body or tip to aid in orientation as the driver regrips and completes the arc across to the far edge. Once through, the suture is pulled across, slack is removed, and the long limb is kept out of the working field.

The same pattern repeats as the wound is closed cranially. After each pass, the operator performs instrument ties. Sometimes the driver remains on the left of the wound for tying; other times the hands shift to the right of the wound, with the line stretched horizontally as the knot is formed and slid into place. The non‑driver hand consistently manages tension on the standing end, pulling laterally to seat the throw and then relaxing as the driver advances the next loop. Across these tying sequences, no forceps are applied to tissue; handling is limited to the suture itself to avoid trauma. Each knot is cinched directly over the centerline, bringing the skin edges together with slight eversion. Where needed, the operator alternates the direction of throws to lock the knot securely and avoid slippage, maintaining a low profile against the skin.

At intervals, suture tails are cut to length. Typically, the scissors enter from the superior‑left or from the right, depending on instrument position at the time, with the other instrument stabilizing the knot or holding a limb of the suture. Cuts are made within a few millimeters of the knot, leaving consistently short tails and a tidy field. Between stitches, the driver may grasp the suture near a recently seated knot to gather slack or control tension while the scissors approach.

The middle and upper thirds of the left vertical wound show the same steady cadence of technique: forehand needle placement with perpendicular entry, symmetric bite depth and spacing, gentle eversion maintained with forceps when used, and immediate conversion of each pass to a secured knot via instrument ties. Across several sequences, the driver orientation and hand dominance shift as needed to optimize approach angles. Sometimes the driver is just left of the incision with forceps on the right stabilizing the opposing edge; at other moments, especially during tying, both hands move to the right side with the suture stretched across the wound axis. The operator takes care to keep the needle parked and out of the tissue plane during tying steps, preventing accidental sticks and preserving the bite’s orientation.

Near the apex of the wound, the operator continues to place and tie additional interrupted stitches. In one series, the needle is advanced from the left edge across to the right, with the right hand forgoing forceps and instead using gloved fingers to tension the standing end and present the tissue while the driver compresses or lifts an edge for entry. After passage, multiple instrument throws are formed and alternated, then cinched down to approximate the edges. The knot is seated slightly to one side of the incision, a common variation consistent with securing on the far or near side based on hand position. Following security, the left hand reappears with scissors to trim, while the driver stabilizes the suture near the knot. In another series, the forceps return to their role on the right edge, lifting the dermis precisely as the driver advances the next bite. The pass is finished, the needle is parked, and the suture is drawn through and managed to the right, preparing for the tie. Throughout these sequences, prior knots below the working area remain undisturbed and serve as landmarks showing the steady, superior progression of closure along the same line.

Once the superiormost stitch is placed, successive throws are formed with the driver to secure it. In one segment, the left hand remains largely off‑screen while controlling the driver; the right hand manages the free end, forming loops and maintaining just enough tension to keep the edges approximated without strangulation. The throws are brought down in sequence and tightened at the apex of the wound. Immediately afterward, the operator addresses final housekeeping: tightening and trimming the knot tails at the topmost stitch. The driver grasps the suture near the knot to steady it while the scissors approach from the right to cut. Both instrument tips work within a few millimeters of the knot at the wound’s superior end. With the cut complete, the line presents a series of evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches with short, neat tails along the left vertical incision.

The closing frames depict a brief assessment without active suturing. For a moment, no instruments are present; then gloved fingertips approach and lightly palpate the skin adjacent to the closed segment, particularly near the superior stitches. The manipulations are gentle, suggesting a check of approximation, eversion, and tension rather than any attempt to place additional sutures. The wound edges along the closed segment remain approximated with slight eversion. Small gaps between a few throws are visible but not gaping, and there is minor puckering along the upper stitches, including radiating skin folds at the most superior bite—consistent with a firm tie at the apex. Elsewhere on the pad, the other slits remain untouched throughout.

From start to finish, the technique remains consistent: a sequence of simple interrupted sutures placed along a single vertical incision on the left side of the pad, progressing from the inferior portion upward. Each stitch is executed with perpendicular needle entry, symmetric dermal purchase, and gentle forceps‑assisted eversion when necessary, followed by instrument ties that are alternated for secure knots and conscientious trimming of tails. Hand positions adapt fluidly to the needs of each step—driver left or right of the wound during placement, opposing forceps elevating the target edge, then both instruments shifting as needed for knot delivery and trimming—yet always stay close to the incision, within a centimeter of the working site, and parallel to the wound axis. The needle is consistently parked away from tissue during ties to maintain safety and alignment. The final state reveals a continuous line of individually tied stitches with the edges approximated and slightly everted, mild puckering at the topmost stitch, and overall closure of the single left vertical incision, with the remainder of the pad’s cuts left undisturbed.
