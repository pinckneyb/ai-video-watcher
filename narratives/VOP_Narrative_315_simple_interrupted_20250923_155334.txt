COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence opens with the suture pad centered on a wood backing, multiple parallel practice cuts visible, and the camera fixed so the lower third of the field shows the target wound. After an identification card is lifted away, the operator commits to the lowest horizontal slit—just a few centimeters above the yellow base of the pad—and keeps returning to this same line for the remainder of the procedure. This slit is straight and relatively short, initially gaping with no stitch in place. From the outset, the left hand works predominantly with a needle driver, and the right hand brings in fine tissue pickups (Adson-type forceps) to control tissue and manage the strand. Throughout the case, ancillary instruments like scissors or a blade handle and occasionally a hemostat are staged to the left of the pad and brought into the field only when needed, then returned to the left margin to keep the working corridor clear.

The initial moments show careful preparation for the first bite. The left hand holds the loaded needle driver, grasping the curved needle approximately at its proximal third to mid-shaft, a secure position that allows precise rotational control. The needle is presented perpendicular to the skin surface of the lower slit, aimed to cross the incision line at roughly 90 degrees. The right hand’s forceps gently grasp and lift the near wound edge, everting the margin to present the dermis cleanly and providing counter-traction. As the forceps lift the tissue, the needle tip advances toward the near edge at an appropriate distance from the margin, setting up a full-thickness bite that will mirror across the far side. The operator’s wrist action—a controlled supination-pronation—uses the curve of the needle to drive the tip through in an arc rather than pushing straight, minimizing tissue trauma and maintaining eversion. The first pass is initiated here; suture begins to pass through, and the thread is laid out neatly across the lower field.

With that foundational bite started, the operator consolidates the first stitch. The needle is drawn through and regrasped as needed to follow the arc and deliver the suture with minimal drag. The right hand alternates between forceps and strand control, keeping tension appropriate but not strangulating the tissue. The two hands move in balanced opposition across the incision, the driver advancing from the operator’s left and the forceps stabilizing from the right. Once adequate length is through and the edges are approximated, instrument ties begin. The needle driver briefly transitions from manipulating the needle to grasping the suture strand to form loops and throws directly over the wound. The knot is seated centrally with deliberate, alternating tension to ensure the throws cinch down neatly without loosening the approximation, and the suture ends are oriented inferiorly to keep the field organized.

After the first stitch is secured, attention shifts along the same slit to place another stitch at the right end. The left hand remains with the needle driver over the lower incision while the right hand reintroduces the forceps to balance and evert the edge at this new location. The needle is, once again, held at the proximal third to mid-curve, oriented perpendicular to the incision. With the forceps elevating the near margin, the left hand drives the needle in a smooth arc to pierce the tissue on the near side, then continues across to exit in the far dermis. The thread is drawn through with measured traction, mindful not to tear the synthetic tissue. As the suture is laid out, the operator repositions the tools and begins constructing the knot with instrument ties. A neat knot is seated at the right end of the same bottom slit, creating another point of approximation. The suture is draped to the right to maintain clarity and to avoid tangling with instruments.

A consistent rhythm follows: the same line is addressed again at its middle third. With the field organized—driver to the left, forceps to the right—the operator sets up another perpendicular pass at the center of the slit. The right hand’s pickups evert the lower or near edge, exposing the dermal layer and stabilizing the target tissue; the left hand advances the needle tip to initiate the next bite. Even when the camera or hand positioning makes the cut appear slightly higher in the field or described as the “second from the bottom,” the maneuvers and instrument relationships remain fixed on the same bottom horizontal slit. The operator’s approach is methodical: take a symmetric bite, cross the incision cleanly, draw the suture through, then convert to knot tying. As each stitch is secured, the driver and forceps cross above the wound while the suture ends are pulled inferiorly, and the knot is cinched snugly over the incision.

At intervals, there are brief pauses from active needle driving to consolidate and secure knots. In these moments, the needle driver often grasps the suture rather than the needle, serving as a tying instrument. The right hand manipulates one or both free ends to set tension properly, sometimes switching to a hemostat or the needle holder for improved grip when securing long tails. The sequence emphasizes knot security and proper placement over speed; each throw is advanced with balanced, opposing tensions to avoid gapping or torqueing the wound edges. In one segment, the right-hand forceps briefly lift the lower wound edge simply to confirm approximation before releasing, then both hands return to tying. This careful checking ensures the previous stitch truly apposes the tissue before the next pass is undertaken.

As new stitches are added and earlier ones secured, the operator periodically trims suture tails that are now redundant. Early on, scissors appear in the left hand to trim an earlier knot at the left-middle of the same slit. Later, a blade-like cutting instrument briefly enters above the bottom incision to cut excess thread near a newly secured knot. Each time, the cutting instrument is introduced deliberately, used quickly, and then returned to the left side of the board to restore a clutter-free working space. After trimming, the left hand promptly re-arms with the needle driver, reloads the needle at roughly one-third from the swage, and recalibrates the needle’s orientation to be perpendicular to the wound for the next bite. The right hand resumes tissue control with the forceps, presenting the edge for entry.

The operator steadily advances along the same incision toward the right, placing clean, symmetric interrupted stitches. Where noted, the left hand’s driver occasionally crosses the incision line to regrasp the needle for the retrieval arc or to pull the suture through without undue force. The right hand alternates sides of the incision depending on which margin is being pierced or from which side the needle is exiting, always using gentle, precise pressure with the pickups to evert and stabilize. Bite spacing and depth appear consistent, and the needle is kept perpendicular to the wound plane to maintain even eversion and avoid oblique tracks. Once a pass is completed, the needle is regrasped near the midpoint of the curve to draw the suture through with a balanced motion, keeping drag minimal and avoiding crushing the synthetic skin. Thread management remains tidy—the long free end typically trails toward the operator’s right, out of the immediate path of the next throw.

Midway through, gauze briefly sweeps across the wound line, likely to remove debris or to dry the field before another pass. The hands return immediately to their prior roles: left with the needle driver poised above the incision, right with the forceps at the target margin. Even in segments where the description suggests the wound appears vertically oriented, the manipulations—driver and pickups straddling the same already sutured line, suture tensioning across previously placed knots—demonstrate that the work continues on the same original slit. The operator tightens a recently placed stitch, repositions the driver on the needle, and resets instrument spacing for the next placement rather than starting on any new cut. No other incisions on the pad are penetrated or actively closed; superior practice slits are repeatedly visible yet remain untouched.

As the line of stitches extends rightward, the operator begins focusing on closing a small residual gap near the right end. The left hand reloads the needle at the proximal third to mid-curve and aligns the arc carefully, perpendicular to the right wound margin. The right hand uses forceps to lift and evert that right edge, exposing the dermis while ensuring that the depth and distance from the margin mirror the opposite side. Occasional small adjustments are made to the driver’s grasp to refine the needle’s angle and the arc of motion before committing to tissue. When the path is ideal, the needle traverses the near edge in one smooth rotation, then exits the far edge with the right hand stabilizing the tissue as the tip emerges. Suture is drawn through deliberately, maintaining gentle tension on existing stitches so the line remains uniformly approximated without pulling any knot off-center.

With the bite completed at the right-most portion, tying begins again. In one sequence, both hands are seen performing hand ties directly over the right-most stitch, suggesting comfort with both instrument and hand knot techniques. Throws are laid down in alternating directions to lock the knot securely in place, then the suture tails are trimmed close to the knot. During this phase, the needle itself is often used as a handle for the strand or parked in the driver as the operator prioritizes knot security. The instruments are kept lateral and parallel to the wound edges during tying to avoid distorting the approximation. Once the knot is seated to satisfaction, scissors approach to cut the tails neatly; the free ends are shortened, and the thread is laid out to the side.

Throughout these maneuvers, the spatial organization remains consistent and disciplined. The suture pad is centered on the wooden backing. The needle driver and forceps usually lie parallel to one another on the left side of the board when idle, ready for rapid redeployment. During passes, the left hand with the needle driver hovers or works just above the incision; the right hand positions the pickups immediately adjacent to the edge being pierced. Hands typically oppose each other across the wound, 1–2 cm apart, creating a stable corridor with unobstructed visualization of the needle path. When not in active use, scissors and hemostats are placed on the left periphery, ensuring there is no crowding over the wound line. There are no crossing hands or instrument conflicts: motions are efficient, arcs are smooth, and changes of instrument are deliberate.

As the closure nears completion, activity is concentrated on securing the last stitch toward the right end and tidying the field. The left hand, still dominant with the needle holder, fine-tunes suture tension over the last knot, while the right hand manages the free end or briefly flashes scissors to trim. No new tissue bites are taken in the final tying segments; instead the attention is on final knot security and tail management. Once those steps are complete, tools are set down to the left, suture ends trail briefly toward the right, and the wound is left with multiple evenly spaced interrupted knots bridging the incision from left to right. The edges sit in close apposition with slight eversion at each stitch. Small, expected gaps remain between knots—characteristic of an interrupted repair—but overall approximation is solid and uniform.

In the closing moments, there is a short interval with no active manipulation. Two gloved hands hover briefly above the pad, then move out of frame. The needle driver and tissue forceps rest parallel on the left of the board. The sutured incision runs horizontally along the lower third of the pad, its edges brought together by the previously placed interrupted stitches. Inferior slits or superior practice cuts remain untouched. The suture tails are trimmed where knots have been secured, and any long strands extend off to the right, staged but no longer under tension. The field shows a clean, orderly repair: the same initial line, now closed by several neatly executed interrupted stitches placed with consistent technique, perpendicular needle entry, careful edge eversion with the pickups, and thoughtful knot construction. The overall result is a stable approximation suitable for healing, with instrument discipline and spatial organization maintained from the first pass to the last tie.
