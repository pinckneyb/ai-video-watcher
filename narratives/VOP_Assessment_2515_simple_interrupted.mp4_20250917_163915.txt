COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens with preparation and orientation over a silicone pad bearing three parallel vertical slits. During the first moments there is a brief, noncommittal hover of instruments above the central slit while the suture packet is brought into view; no tissue is contacted, no needle is yet loaded, and no passes are made. After this setup interlude, the operator commits decisively to the vertical cut nearest the pad’s right edge and conducts the entire closure on this single line.

Work begins at the lower-to-mid third of this rightmost incision. The needle driver and tissue forceps come in from the operator’s right side and straddle the cut. The driver holds the curved needle roughly two-thirds from its tip, with the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin surface. The forceps lift and evert the near edge just medial to the right incision margin, defining a clean, symmetric entry point. The needle is guided in a short, controlled arc through the dermis, across the gap, and into the opposing edge, maintaining consistent bite depth and distance from the wound edge. The emphasis is on perpendicular entry and exit with a shallow, even dermal bite on both sides to promote apposition and gentle eversion. At this stage, the pass is completed and the suture is drawn through; tying follows with the driver holding the short end while the opposite limb is tensioned smoothly to seat a square, instrument-tied knot over the wound. This first knot sits slightly lateral on the right side, with short tails cut.

Building from that foundation, the operator establishes a steady rhythm of interrupted placements on this same right-edge wound. The hands maintain a consistent choreography: the hand with the needle driver alternates between right and left dominance depending on approach angle and access at the top or bottom of the evolving row, while the assisting hand uses forceps to evert the edge for entry and then to receive the needle tip as it emerges on the far side. When forceps are not in play—one early segment shows none used—the assistant instead stabilizes the tissue with fingertips and uses suture tension alone to approximate and evert. Despite these slight variations, the core technique remains stable: the needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip, aligned perpendicular to the skin, and advanced through each margin along a short, controlled arc. Bites are symmetric and equidistant from the edge, with suture tension applied thoughtfully to avoid strangulation.

As the closure develops, the surgeon works proximally (superiorly) along this same slit. Several sequences show a new stitch being initiated with the driver approaching from the right side, the forceps lifting the near (right) edge, and the needle passing first through the right margin before being reloaded and advanced through the left. The suture is drawn through and then tied with an instrument tie, alternating the direction of throws to create square, secure knots. During tying, the driver often anchors the short end near the centerline of the slit while the assistant pulls the opposite limb laterally to create the loop and then seats the knot. Multiple throws are placed for security, and scissors are brought in to trim tails short, leaving a neat row of small, lateral tails. At times, the assistant hand briefly exchanges instruments—forceps for scissors and back again—or simply hovers to manage loop formation, then reverts to edge control for the next pass.

Through the mid-portion of the procedure, the pattern holds: a new pass is taken just proximal to the last, the edges are gently everted with forceps, the needle is driven perpendicular to the skin following its curvature, and a square knot is set and cut. This cycle repeats, progressively closing gaps at the upper half of the rightmost slit. In several sequences the needle is parked after a pass, transforming the driver into a tying instrument while the assistant hand either grasps the free end or exchanges forceps for scissors to cut tails. Where visualization is tight at the superior end, the driver may work slightly superior and lateral to the cut, with the assistant moving medially to provide countertraction and maintain tidy suture alignment. Scissors typically approach from the left side, crossing above the wound to trim tails flush with the knot.

Occasional small variations in technique are observed without disrupting the closure plan. In one early segment, minimal edge eversion is achieved without dedicated forceps; the operator uses the suture line itself and fingertip stabilization to coax the margins together, then ties down the stitch gently to avoid inversion. Elsewhere, the forceps resume their role to create reliable eversion and consistent bite spacing. At several points, tying and tail trimming dominate the frames with no new needle passage shown—a sign of consolidating the most recent stitch, maintaining hemostasis and apposition, and preparing for the next placement. The needle is frequently reloaded at the proximal third, ensuring that subsequent entries remain perpendicular and arcs remain smooth as work advances toward the top of the slit.

As the row of stitches extends, the superior portion of the wound becomes the active workspace. Here, the hands draw closer together to accommodate tighter quarters near the apex. The driver often rests superior-right of the incision; the forceps engage the near or far edge as needed to present the bite site. Passes are smaller, still symmetric, and the knots sit neatly over the wound line. Where existing stitches could obstruct motion, the driver and forceps remain parallel to the incision and the suture line is kept lateral to avoid entanglement. Several sequences emphasize finishing steps: tightening the last throw of a knot, cutting tails short, and briefly assessing tissue response—edge alignment, eversion, and any puckering. Slight puckering is seen near the superior end in later frames, consistent with snug approximation and the normal behavior of a synthetic pad under tension.

While all active suturing continues on the right-edge slit, there are two moments worth noting to ensure continuity is clear. At the very beginning, instruments briefly hover over the central slit during setup without touching tissue. Much later, there is a transient relocation of the loaded needle toward the central-right slit with forceps lifting its edge as if to initiate a pass. However, no subsequent pass, tying, or trimming on that middle line is shown, and all later activity—including trimming, regrasping the needle, and tying—resumes at the right-edge incision. This brief misalignment reflects staging and repositioning rather than a change in the operative target; closure proceeds exclusively on the lateral right slit throughout.

Mid-to-late segments show repeated cycles of tying and trimming at the upper end of the right-side wound, interspersed with needle reloading and repositioning for the next bite. The assistant sometimes releases the forceps to tension the free limb directly with fingertips, improving loop control during instrument ties. When knots are seated, they are cinched squarely and then cut, leaving short tails. The needle is regrasped at an appropriate point on its body and oriented once again to pass perpendicular to the skin, maintaining consistency from stitch to stitch. The spacing of stitches appears close and regular, and the depth of bites remains uniform, contributing to even approximation from the midline toward the superior apex.

Near the end of the sequence, after several passes and ties have been completed at the top of the right-edge slit, attention shifts almost entirely to finishing maneuvers—final tightening, last trims, and a brief pause to assess. Instruments cluster at the superior end while scissors cut the last visible tails. There are short intervals where a hand hovers above the field and no active manipulation occurs, signaling a deliberate assessment of the closure before stopping. The row at this point displays closely spaced, simple interrupted knots along the right slit, with the knot vector generally oriented laterally and the tails short. Mild puckering is visible near the superior end, a common effect of snug approximation in a training substrate, and eversion appears modest but present across the stitch line.

Throughout, spatial relationships are carefully controlled. The driver and forceps work in opposing roles across the slit: one presents the bite, the other advances the needle along a precise arc. The driver remains perpendicular to the wound at entry and exit; regrasping is performed to preserve the curvature and avoid torqueing the needle. The assistant keeps the suture line out of the way, arcing it across the pad to prevent crossing the other two cuts. When cutting, scissors enter thoughtfully from the side that offers the best access without jeopardizing the newly formed knot. At no point do instruments contact or manipulate the unused central slits, aside from the brief, noncommittal approach described above. The operative choreography remains wound-centric and efficient.

By the final frames, the rightmost vertical incision is closed along its worked segment with a contiguous series of neatly spaced interrupted stitches. The edges are well approximated with consistent bite depth, the knots are square and seated at the surface, and tails are trimmed short. The mid and left slits remain untouched and open, confirming that all active suturing has been confined to the right-edge line. The final visual impression is of a methodical simple interrupted closure executed with controlled needle handling, consistent perpendicular entries, gentle eversion via forceps or suture tension, and careful knot security and trimming, culminating in a tidy, stable repair with slight superior puckering typical of a properly tightened training pad closure. Where minor inconsistencies in setup or instrument positioning occurred, they did not alter the plan or disrupt the technique; the closure remained focused and coherent from the first bite on the right slit through the last cut of the tails at its superior end.
