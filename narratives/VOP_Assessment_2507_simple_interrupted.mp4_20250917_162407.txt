COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session begins with preparation rather than immediate entry into tissue. A central vertical slit on the synthetic pad is identified and kept in view while the operator organizes instruments and the suture. The needle holder appears first, hovering above the superior half of that central line without engaging it, while the opposite hand brings a suture packet into the field. Over the next moments the packaging is opened and the curved needle and strand are retrieved. The needle is grasped near its mid‑body, then passed and regrasped until the driver holds it at the proper point on the curve for controlled, perpendicular placement. Throughout this setup the hands remain superior and slightly right of the central incision and above the field, keeping the pad untouched and the edges unmanipulated.

With the needle now loaded, the operator rehearses hand coordination above the midline cut. The right hand, using pickups, presents the needle to the left‑hand needle driver; the jaws open, accept the needle, and close at the proximal-to-mid third of the needle. The instrument alignment is correct for a forehand drive, yet the tissue is still not grasped. Both hands lift away as the suturing area remains undisturbed. The driver is then brought back in from the right, with the curve still visible and the thread trailing to the right. Only at the end of this early preparation is there a brief initiation: the pickups lift the right edge of the central slit a few millimeters off the surface and the needle tip is brought down perpendicular to the skin to start a bite from right to left. This isolated pass on the central line serves as a demonstration of approach and angle rather than the start of a closure sequence. No knot follows, and the central incision is not pursued further in the later sequence.

After this opening, all subsequent closure work proceeds on the right‑most vertical incision near the pad’s right edge. The operator repositions without engaging the central or left slits. At the lower end of the right‑hand wound, the left hand centers the needle driver over the line while the right hand, now with Adson‑type forceps, controls and everts the near (right) edge. The needle is held about two‑thirds from its tip, oriented perpendicular to the surface, and swept through in a smooth arc. The pickups maintain gentle, tooth‑supported eversion as the tip emerges on the far (left) edge at a symmetric depth. The driver regrips the needle to complete its passage and then grasps the suture close to the needle to pull the strand through. The free end is managed laterally to the right to avoid tangling.

With this first stitch across the lower end of the right‑side incision complete, the operator transitions directly to knot tying using an instrument tie technique. The needle is parked or controlled on the long strand; the driver becomes the working instrument, acting as post and grasper. The right hand sweeps the long limb around the driver jaws; the driver captures the short tail and seats the throw down centrally over the wound. Additional throws follow in alternating configuration to secure the knot snugly without crushing tissue. Tension is balanced across the line to approximate the edges with slight eversion. Once satisfied, the left hand introduces scissors and, with the right hand stabilizing the knot or adjacent skin with pickups, trims the tails close for a neat finish.

There is a brief detour to a small oblique cut near the lower‑right corner of the pad. A single interrupted stitch is placed and tied at that separate site, likely as a short demonstration or practice pass. The technique is identical—perpendicular entry, controlled arc, instrument tie, and close trimming—and then the activity returns to the main vertical wound. Aside from this brief and discrete interlude, the remainder of the work adheres consistently to closure of the same right‑most vertical incision.

Back on the main line, the operator resets. A short interval shows instrument organization above the field with the driver opening and closing without contacting tissue. The next stitch is planned immediately adjacent to the existing knot at the inferior end. The pattern remains consistent: the left hand drives the needle; the right hand with pickups everts the edge and controls the needle tip on exit. The needle is grasped approximately at the proximal third, perpendicular to the skin. Short, deliberate hand‑offs maintain the integrity of the arc and keep the bite depths symmetric on both sides of the incision. The suture is then drawn through to working length.

With that bite across, the operator again converts to an instrument tie. The driver tip centers over the stitch site, the right hand wraps the long strand and hands off the tail to the driver, and the throws are advanced down the standing end. The knot is seated with deliberate downward pressure to bring the edges into apposition with gentle eversion. The pickups then lift the knot so scissors can be introduced parallel to the skin surface; tails are cut short and clean.

Progressing proximally up the wound, the next series of frames shows the driver hovering midline while the right hand sometimes uses fingers rather than pickups to tent the skin and control suture slack. The needle is reloaded several times to optimize angle and approach. Where the lower part is now well approximated, attention moves to the superior portion where the edges remain mobile. The right hand resumes pickups to stabilize the edge and present a defined entry point. The driver approaches from the left/superior side; the needle tip is aligned at the near edge a few millimeters from the margin. The entry is executed at ninety degrees, and the needle follows its curvature through dermis and emerges on the far side at a matching depth. Thread is pulled through smoothly and routed laterally to the right, keeping loops clear of the already tied knots below.

Another instrument tie follows. The left hand maintains the driver aligned along the wound axis while the right hand operates lateral to the incision, “posting” the long strand and looping throws over the driver. The driver captures the tail, and successive throws are seated with the wound centered between the hands. Scissors then enter to trim the tails under visualization, with the right hand continuing to steady tissue and knot.

The workflow becomes rhythmic. At each new level along the superior segment, the same pattern repeats:

- The left hand, with needle driver, reloads the needle at the appropriate point on its curve and approaches perpendicular to the edge.
- The right hand with Adsons everts and stabilizes first the near edge during entry, then crosses to the opposite edge to guide the exiting needle tip for a controlled exit without tearing.
- The driver releases and regrips as needed to complete the pass and draw the suture through, keeping tension modest and oriented away from the field to avoid entangling the growing row of knots.
- An instrument tie is performed, with the driver serving as the working instrument to deliver throws neatly down onto the wound while the right hand manages the long limb and stabilizes the knot.
- Scissors are introduced from the left side to cut tails short, parallel to the skin, while the right hand holds the knot up with pickups to prevent cutting too close or injuring tissue.

As the closure advances into the upper third of the incision, several sequences emphasize meticulous setup for each subsequent bite. The driver is seen hovering just lateral to the wound, the needle clamped at its mid‑third with the curve oriented toward the pad. The operator pauses to reset the needle orientation, ensuring the jaws are angled to follow a natural arc through the dermal plane. During these pauses, the right hand often manages the slack, holding the suture off to the right so that prior stitches remain undisturbed and the working field stays clear.

A subsequent run shows the right‑hand pickups coaxing slight eversion while the left hand sweeps the needle through another bite near the top of the line. Immediately after passage, the pickups reach across to capture the needle tip and protect tissue as it exits, handing it back to the driver for regrip. The suture is drawn through steadily and prepared for tying. The instrument tie proceeds with the driver positioned vertically over the incision and the right hand wrapping throws neatly and seating them one by one. Tails are cut short, maintaining a consistent appearance along the row.

At intervals, the operator checks and organizes rather than driving new bites. The driver remains poised over the superior end while the right hand enters with pickups to lift a knot and then switches to straight scissors to trim tails flush to the knot. On other passes, the driver holds the needle ready but the right hand is off‑frame, suggesting strand management just out of view; no additional tissue penetration occurs in these brief pauses. When both hands return, they assume their familiar positions straddling the incision—driver on the left/medial side, pickups on the right/lateral side—preparing for the next stitch.

The uppermost bites exploit the same precise technique. The needle is presented perpendicular to the skin, the angle of the driver adjusted to follow the curve smoothly, and the right‑hand pickups evert the edge. Each bite captures a consistent width from the margin, and the exit on the opposite side mirrors the entry depth. Once through, the suture is brought across and drawn to length. Instrument ties are performed without pulling the knots to one side; the throws are centered and seated evenly. The pickup tips then present the knot so scissors can trim tails to a short, uniform length, enhancing the final cosmetic layout. Where necessary, the needle is transferred temporarily to the driver and held lateral to the wound while the suture is managed or the field is tidied.

As the superior end of the incision nears completion, there are moments of preparation without penetration: the driver holds the needle at the correct point on its curve and hovers, the right hand manipulates the loop or tail, and then both hands withdraw briefly to reset. When they return, another bite is taken and completed in the same disciplined fashion.

Throughout, the spatial choreography is consistent:

- The left hand is the driver of the needle and the instrument for ties, working mostly superior‑medial to the wound and crossing the incision as needed with the needle following its arc.
- The right hand is the tissue manager and assistant, stationed lateral to the wound. It stabilizes and everts the wound edge during penetrations, retrieves the needle tip to prevent uncontrolled exits, and then becomes the suture manager during tying and trimming, sometimes substituting fingers for pickups for minor adjustments.
- The hands rarely crowd the wound; instead, they create a small working triangle over the targeted entry/exit point. The thread is always routed away from the field, typically to the right, avoiding contact with completed knots and ensuring visibility.

Toward the end, the sequence includes trimming of knot tails at the topmost stitches, with scissors entering from the left and blades kept parallel to the skin surface to prevent accidental injury. After trimming, the instruments are withdrawn, then reapproach to prepare another potential bite; when that bite is not taken immediately, both hands again pause, confirming alignment and suture control. Finally, a measuring ruler is introduced along the superior edge of the pad, positioned just above the sutured line while both hands adjust its position from either side. No further tissue engagement occurs during this measurement step; it appears to serve as documentation or self‑assessment of spacing and alignment.

A few frames show potential deviations from this single‑line progression. Early, a pass is initiated on the central slit but not pursued. Later, a single stitch and tie are executed on a small oblique cut near the pad’s lower‑right corner. There is also a brief mention of moving toward an adjacent vertical slit; however, the sustained, repeated, and completed work—passes, ties, and tail trimming—occurs on the right‑most vertical incision. These brief departures do not develop into closures; they read as demonstrations and are not continued. The closure that is initiated, carried forward, and finished is on the right‑side vertical line.

By the end of the procedure, the right‑most incision is approximated along its length with a neat series of simple interrupted sutures placed from the inferior end upward. Each stitch shows controlled, perpendicular entry and exit with mirror‑image bite depths and slight eversion across the wound, and each knot has been seated centrally and trimmed to short, uniform tails. The spacing between stitches is consistent relative to their size, and the thread is managed cleanly without tangling or crossing. The central and left parallel slits remain essentially untouched except for the initial preparatory maneuver at the center; the small oblique corner cut has a single stitch from the brief demonstration. The final view shows the right‑side line closed in a methodical, well‑organized interrupted pattern, with instruments removed from the field and a ruler briefly positioned above for assessment, confirming an orderly, symmetric closure from distal to proximal without tension or gapping between stitches.
