Pattern: Simple Interrupted



Summative assessment:
Your workflow is deliberate and confident, with crisp needle loading, perpendicular rotational passes, and disciplined hand opposition during instrument ties. The pass–tie–trim cadence is steady, the driver stays low to protect tissue, and suture management keeps the field orderly while knots seat centrally and predictably.

Tighten the efficiency and tissue respect further by releasing the tissue once approximation is achieved rather than holding with forceps during tying, and by minimizing regrips or parking the driver—keep the needle secured in the driver and in a neutral zone. Standardize your metrics (5–8 mm bite depth/offset and 5–10 mm spacing) and declare your planned number of throws by suture type to embed repeatability. Maintain the same low, centered knot placement while ensuring uniform tail length and avoiding crossing instruments over tissue; these refinements will elevate an already competent technique to a consistently exemplary one.
