Pattern: Simple Interrupted

RUBRIC ASSESSMENT:
1. Perpendicular needle passes: The needle is consistently fine‑tuned and driven with a 90-degree, orthogonal trajectory on entry and exit, minimizing shear. Strong control earns a high score, though symmetry of bite depth/width is not explicitly emphasized throughout. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

2. Gentle tissue handling: The left hand uses pickups only when needed to evert and define edges, with no crushing or repetitive grasps, and overall minimal tissue contact. This is atraumatic and controlled, with only brief, purposeful stabilization maneuvers. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

3. Square, secure knots: Instrument ties alternate direction, seat flat over the incision, and are trimmed cleanly; a hemostat is used strategically once to maintain tension while finishing throws. Knots are centered, flat, and reliable without over-tightening. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

4. Appropriate approximation/tension: Edges are brought together with balanced traction that avoids blanching, puckering, or gapping, and knots settle directly over the line. The apposition is consistently controlled across laceration types. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm): The series reads as tidy and uniform, but intervals vary across different wound geometries, especially at short vertical and corner closures. Spacing meets standard without clear, consistent 0.5–1.0 cm indexing along lines. Score: 3 3/5 competent

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable): Pickups are used to create eversion at entry, and finished closures show flat-to-slight eversion with no inversion or excess distortion. This produces favorable edge profile across the field. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

7. Economy of time and motion: Workflow is deliberate and efficient with seamless transitions, parked instruments, minimal crossing, and the needle kept out of the tying zone; movements are compact and repeatable. Occasional scissor retrieval and tail tagging add minor extra steps without disrupting flow. Score: 4 4/5 proficient

SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT:
Your motion and flow are disciplined and repeatable: load, bite, clear the needle, tie with alternating throws, trim, and move on. The cadence is unhurried yet efficient, reflecting confidence without haste, and the sequence transitions are clean with the needle reliably parked and the post managed consistently.

Hand coordination is strong—right hand drives and tensions with authority while the left anchors the field and post—resulting in square knots placed directly over the line and edges that meet without trauma. Instrument traffic is intentional and economical, though you can trim a few movements by limiting tail regrasping and avoiding reliance on a hemostat for tension.

To elevate further, standardize spacing and bite geometry across all wound types and maintain a measured map along each closure line. Consider reducing instrument exchanges by pre‑positioning scissors for immediate trim and tightening throws with even lower-profile wrist motion to eliminate the need for tag‑assists while maintaining precise, balanced tension.
