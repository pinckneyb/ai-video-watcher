COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single, short vertical skin incision on the right side of the practice pad throughout the recording. From the first frames through the last, the operator methodically places sequential, small skin stitches along the same incision, working immediately adjacent to prior closures and progressively extending and completing the line of closure. The work is performed on a synthetic skin pad; throughout the case the needle, suture thread, forceps and driver remain in tight coordination over the wound as the operator advances stitch-by-stitch.

Initial approach and first passes (0.0–44.0 s)
At the start the incision is identified just right of center on the pad, a short vertical slit with a few previously placed interruptions visible nearby. The operator adopts a classic two-instrument technique: a needle driver in one hand and fine toothed tissue forceps in the other. Early frames show the left hand consistently providing needle control with a long, ringed, ratcheted needle driver approaching from the left/superior quadrant; the right hand stabilizes and presents the tissue with Adson-style forceps or thumb-forceps coming in from the right/inferior side. A curved, swaged needle is grasped in the driver typically near mid‑shaft (sometimes one‑third to one‑half from the swage) so the curvature can be used to pass the tip through the dermal edge in a controlled arc. Needle orientation varies as needed—nearly perpendicular for through-and-through bites, tangential for shallow epidermal passes, and oblique when the operator rotates the driver to complete the arc.

Tissue engagement is conservative and superficial: bites are taken through epidermal and dermal analog layers of the pad, with the forceps lifting and slightly everting the near edge while the driver transfixes the opposing edge. The operator aims for small, precise bites placed close to the wound margin so that the resulting approximation is atraumatic and the edges evert slightly when tensioned. After each pass the suture is drawn through and the free limb is routed into position for knot tying; in these opening sequences the suture loop forms across the wound and remains externalized while the operator prepares the knot.

Early hand positions are stable and bilateral: the driver remains on the viewer’s left delivering the needle tip to the wound, and the forceps on the viewer’s right receives the needle and aligns tissue. Hands remain close to the wound—typically 1–3 cm apart—so instrument tips cross minimally above the skin and the needle trajectory is tightly controlled.

Establishing the row and repetition of simple interrupted stitches (45.0–164.0 s)
As the case progresses the operator continues placing successive, small interrupted stitches adjacent to a column of completed knots. Each new stitch is placed immediately medial to the previously tied stitches, extending the closed column along the incision axis. The pattern is repetitive and deliberate: the driver presents the needle, the forceps tents and everts the edge, the needle is advanced through the opposite margin and pulled through, the suture limb is tensioned and secured into a knot. Occasionally the operator uses a hemostat or clamp to hold the suture tail while manipulating the loop and making the knot; in other frames fingertip control is used to tension the loop and form throws.

Needle grip and trajectory show some subtle variation aimed at control: on some passes the needle is grasped slightly more distally to permit a steeper perpendicular entry for a full dermal bite; on others the grasp is closer to midshaft to allow a shallower epidermal pass. The bites remain small, close to the wound edge, and the forceps maintain gentle apposition. Slight eversion is consistently sought so that when knots are tied the skin edges come together with an outward turnover—typical for simple interrupted skin closure.

Technique adaptation and manual tying (150.0–224.0 s)
Through the mid-section of the recording the operator alternates between instrument-assisted knot tying and fingertip manipulation. Several frames show the needle not held in an instrument while the operator uses fingertips to adjust suture tension and tie down loops. In these moments the left hand often transitions from needle-driving to holding the suture tail between thumb and index finger; the right hand uses a finger or forceps to appose the edges and complete knots. This alternation demonstrates the operator’s comfort with both formal instrument-based knot tying and manual, tactile tensioning of the knot.

During these passes the spatial relationships are consistent: driver and forceps remain opposite each other across the wound axis and converge centrally during needle passage. Hands maintain a close working distance of roughly 1–4 cm and coordinate—one applying steady countertraction on tissue and suture, the other effecting needle rotation and passage. Where present, a hemostat is used intermittently to secure tails and prevent entanglement while subsequent throws are placed.

Progressing the closure—apex and superior extension (225.0–314.0 s)
The operator continues the same stitch pattern toward the superior/apical portion of the incision. The left-hand driver remains the instrument of choice to deliver the curved needle, and the right hand maintains tissue presentation and suture management. Needle passes here are described as mid-to-full dermal in some frames, whereas in others they are superficial-to-mid-dermal—an expected minor variability on a synthetic pad where layer depth is simulated. Bites are consistently placed at the epidermal/dermal junction, again emphasizing small, precise placements to achieve good edge approximation with minimal puckering.

At the superior end, the operator occasionally positions the needle with a slightly different approach angle to follow local contour: the driver approaches from a more lateral-superior vector, and the forceps present at a complementary inferior-medial vector so the needle arc smoothly traverses from one flap to the other. The suture tail is co-managed—sometimes clamped inferiorly, sometimes looped and held with a hemostat—to allow unencumbered knot formation.

Small variations, observations and occasional ambiguities (300.0–345.0 s)
Throughout the mid- and later-stage frames there are a few episodes where instrument use and suture handling differ from the predominant pattern. In some short sequences the operator appears to tension and finish knots manually without a needle in the driver, or to manipulate a loop with fingertips while using the other hand to control the free limb. Another localized set of frames depicts work on a small circular defect on the pad where a circumferential running/purse-like suture sequence appears to be completed; that scene is anatomically distinct from the vertical linear incision that is the primary working site and likely represents either a different practice target on the pad or a brief instructional demonstration in the recording. Adhering to the recorded technique label and the dominant pattern in the video, the main closure throughout the recording remains the series of small interrupted skin sutures along the same vertical linear incision.

Hand ergonomics and instrument interchange (345.0–404.0 s)
Later frames reiterate the two-instrument approach but also show more frequent interchange of roles: the left hand occasionally shifts from needle driving to holding and tensioning the suture while the right hand takes on needle or tissue control, depending on the small positional needs. The approach is pragmatic—when delicate fingertip control is needed to seat a knot or to precisely approximate an edge, the operator uses hands without instruments; when a secure pass is needed, the needle is regrasped in the driver. This demonstrates technique versatility while remaining true to the overall simple interrupted technique.

Needle grips are adjusted as necessary—sometimes grasped closer to the hub for more power and control for a deeper bite, sometimes grasped further along the shaft to permit fine rotation for a superficial, epidermal pass. The operator consistently uses the forceps to lift and align the tissue and to receive the needle tip; bite location remains close to the epidermal edge to avoid excess tissue inversion.

Final tying, trimming and inspection (405.0–454.0 s)
In the final phase the operator completes the remaining stitches along the incision and moves into knot finalization and trimming. Many frames show the left hand actively tensioning the free suture strand between thumb and index while the right hand manipulates the loop and finishes the throws—sometimes with a small hemostat poised to clamp a tail. The suture material is pulled snugly so the edges lie in even apposition with slight eversion, and excess tails are trimmed in later frames. The last frames present a tidy column of evenly spaced, small interrupted knots running along the right-central vertical incision; the sutures are close-set, consistent in bite depth and spacing, and maintain the slight eversion desired for epidermal edge approximation.

Throughout the record, the synthetic pad limits precise judgment of true layer purchase and tension biomechanics, and occasional frames obscure the needle or show fingertip tying rather than clear instrument-based knot-tying. Nonetheless the operator’s intent and technique are consistent: small simple interrupted skin stitches placed sequentially and secured with controlled tension to achieve edge-to-edge approximation.

Overall technique and final appearance
From start to finish the operator uses a controlled, bimanual two-instrument method to repair the single short vertical incision on the right side of the pad. The needle driver is predominantly on the left, delivering a curved needle through controlled arcs; the forceps are typically on the right, elevating and everting the epidermal margin to produce small dermal bites. Stitches are placed sequentially along the incision, each pass followed by suture draw-through, loop formation and knot securing. The operator alternates between instrument-assisted and fingertip tie techniques when appropriate, and uses a hemostat intermittently to secure tails. Bites are generally superficial to mid-dermal in depth with slight eversion, and the instruments converge closely above the wound (usually within a few centimeters) for precise control.

By the end of the video the incision is closed with a neat column of small, evenly spaced interrupted sutures; edges are approximated with slight eversion, knots are secured and tails managed or trimmed. The closure presents as a watertight, low-profile skin approximation appropriate for a training model, reflecting repeated, consistent application of the simple interrupted technique across the full length of the incision.
