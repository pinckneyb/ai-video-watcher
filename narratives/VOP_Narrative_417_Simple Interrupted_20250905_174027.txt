COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a clean training field with multiple linear lacerations on a synthetic skin pad. After the label is removed, the right hand (green glove) enters with a gold‑handled needle driver while the left hand arrives with tissue forceps and takes position at the lower‑left vertical incision. The right hand loads the curved needle at about the proximal third to mid‑shaft, aiming it perpendicular to the skin surface. The left forceps stabilize and slightly lift the near wound edge to present tissue and encourage eversion. This is a setup phase—no needle penetration is completed yet—but the approach, grip, and angle are established, with instruments converging over the left‑lower incision.

With the workspace set, the scene shifts to knot tying on a stitch that has already been placed. The left hand now holds a needle driver just left of center, and the right hand manages the suture ends across the lower third of the field. The needle itself is not used; instead, the driver acts purely as a tying instrument. The right hand forms loops and feeds the short and long limbs to the driver, which alternately clamps and transfers the strands to execute instrument throws. The driver crosses toward the right to pick up the opposite limb, then returns left to seat each throw. The knot is squared with symmetric horizontal tension and centered over the entry site. Throughout, the hands remain above the field and work deliberately to avoid dragging across the pad.

The focus continues on the same inferior‑left wound as the right hand maintains control of the suture and the needle remains parked on the long limb off to the right, kept safely out of the immediate wound area. No additional needle passes are taken. The right hand tightens the early throws to approximate the edges without crushing them, and subsequent throws are added with the driver to lock in a simple interrupted knot. The rhythm is steady: form the loop, grasp the opposite limb, separate the hands to cinch, then repeat in the reverse direction to square. The knot seats centrally; long tails remain, not yet cut.

Attention turns briefly to suture management and needle retrieval. A hemostat or needle holder is parked vertically at the left edge to hold the suture tail and provide counter‑tension while the right hand enters with a driver, then switches to pickups to grasp the needle near the tip. With no forceful tissue handling, the needle is gently recovered from the near edge along the pre‑existing path and drawn out. The suture is then pulled straight across the field to organize slack, with the parked clamp maintaining steady tension. No new tissue bite is taken; this is purely retrieval and strand management.

The operator returns to instrument ties at the same left‑lower incision. The left hand brings in the needle driver above the site; the right hand manipulates the tail and, briefly, a gauze square to aid tension control. Loops are placed over the driver, the driver grasps and pulls the tail through, and the hands separate laterally to set each throw. After securing a square knot, the needle is re‑presented in the driver at the classic proximal‑to‑mid needle grip, oriented perpendicular to the driver—ready for the next pass when needed. For the moment, however, tying dominates: the left hand continues to operate the driver, and the right hand controls the free end from the right side of the field. The knot is seated directly over the short lower‑left incision with controlled, symmetric tension; tissue edges remain approximated without forceps.

Shortly thereafter, the left driver is held vertically near the wound as a stabilizer while the right hand, now with fine pickups, takes over to retrieve the needle/suture at the exit point. The needle has already traversed the tissue from a pass not shown here; no new penetration is performed. The right hand grasps the needle or adjacent suture, then transitions to pulling the strand laterally to the right to clear slack and prevent recoil into the wound while the left driver holds position near the entry. This keeps the field organized and the knot site undisturbed.

The next movement is a return to instrument tying to secure the stitch that has just been pulled through. The left hand continues with the driver just left of the wound; the right hand brings the free end from right to left to wrap over the driver. The driver grasps the short tail near the knot, the right hand tensions the long limb, and the throw is seated down to tissue. The roles then switch for the counter‑throw, with both hands pulling horizontally in opposite directions to square the knot over the bite without lifting the wound edges. The sequence is smooth and repeatable, producing a stable, centered knot.

With the knot set, the workflow transitions to trimming. The dominant hand introduces gold‑handled scissors while the assisting hand controls the suture tails with forceps, keeping tension on the free end away from the knot so trimming does not disturb it. Scissors approach parallel to the wound line, and the tails are cut to length. Instruments are then withdrawn, leaving a tidy, secured interrupted stitch on the left‑lower incision with consistent spacing to adjacent sutures.

The field quiets briefly before the operator moves up to another site—now the left‑middle vertical incision. Initially, no hands are visible, and previously placed interrupted sutures are apparent. Then both gloved hands enter: the right hand carries a needle driver, and the left hand takes tissue forceps. This is a classic needle pass sequence. The needle is grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body and oriented perpendicular to the pad. The left forceps lift and steady the near wound edge for precision and eversion while the right driver advances the needle through the left edge. The forceps guide the tip to protect tissue and ensure an appropriate bite. Once through, the right hand retrieves the needle and draws the suture through in a controlled arc, keeping the strand organized and the pad undisturbed.

With the bite completed, the technique reverts to instrument ties. The green‑gloved hand uses the driver over the stitch site; the opposite hand pulls the long tail laterally to the right. The driver alternately grasps the short and long ends to build sequential throws. No forceps engage the tissue here; approximation is maintained by the placed bite and suture tension. The throws are alternated in direction to square the knot, tensioned along the wound axis, and cinched down gently so the knot sits directly over the incision between adjacent stitches.

The tying continues with deliberate, economical movements. The right hand brings the free end across the incision to create loops; the driver picks up and passes the ends through, then both hands oppose to tighten each throw. Scissors briefly appear but are set aside; cutting does not occur in this segment. The needle remains on the long limb off to the right, parked outside the immediate field while tying proceeds. Knots are seated neatly in line with the prior sutures, preserving even spacing.

In the final tying sequence, an instrument appears from the upper left, and the right hand (green glove) occupies the mid‑right field, pronated and controlling the free suture end. The instrument tips come to rest just left of the wound line over the most recent stitch, and the two tools converge on the knot. The suture is snugged precisely—this is a brief, controlled tightening to finish the set. No new passes are made, and the needle is not visible. After this last adjustment, both hands and instruments withdraw. The field clears to reveal a left‑sided incision partially closed with evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures; other incisions remain untouched. The overall flow has been methodical: prepare and organize the field, pass when needed with forceps‑assisted eversion, retrieve and manage the strand, then use instrument ties—alternating throws, squared and seated with gentle, symmetric tension—finishing with controlled trimming where shown. The rhythm is consistent and efficient, with careful strand management (needle often parked on the long limb to the right), minimal tissue handling except during needle passage, and deliberate knot placement centered over each bite to achieve clean approximation across the left incisions.
