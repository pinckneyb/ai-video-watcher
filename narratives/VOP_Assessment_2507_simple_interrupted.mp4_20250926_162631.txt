COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with preparatory movements and instrument positioning over the simulator pad, and within the first seconds the operator surveys the field and establishes a working posture. Early frames show attention briefly directed to the midline slit, with instruments approaching from the top and top‑right and a needle‑driver passed over the central incision; however, in these initial segments there are no definitive needle passes through that cut. The hands remain superior to the midline wound while the assistant’s or non‑dominant hand handles suture tags and packaging; tissue edges remain largely unguided in that area. This initial activity functions as setup and suture management rather than closure of the central slit.

Shortly after these preparatory steps the team concentrates on the right lateral column of wounds — the vertical incision on the right side of the pad becomes the working target and remains the focus for the remainder of the recording. From the moment attention shifts, the operator consistently uses a curved needle and a needle‑driver in concert with fine tissue forceps to perform interrupted, epidermal approximation bites along that right vertical line. Throughout the sequence the technique is a conventional simple interrupted closure on synthetic dermal substrate, executed as a disciplined sequence of bite, retrieval, tensioning, knotting and tail management repeated along the same incision.

Needle control and passage technique
Across the entire procedure the operator consistently uses a curved suture needle grasped in the needle‑driver rather than hand‑held. The grasp point shifts modestly with the task: when precision and control are required for a short, shallow bite the driver holds the needle nearer the tip or mid‑shaft; when the needle is being positioned or rotated through a longer arc the grasp moves slightly proximal toward the midpoint or swage. The driver is habitually rotated so that the needle arc points into the wound, and small wrist/forearm rotations carry the needle through a controlled arc from near edge to far edge. Needle entry is generally perpendicular-to-oblique to the simulator surface for short dermal bites; in several passes the driver is aligned vertically above the wound to achieve a firm, perpendicular entry that captures superficial dermal material and produces slight eversion on closure.

The non‑dominant hand provides counter‑traction and presentation using toothed pickups/Adson‑style forceps. The forceps repeatedly pick up and evert the near wound edge while stabilizing the dermis, presenting an appropriate bite for the needle to engage. When the operator uses fingertip pressure instead of forceps in a few frames, the same control is achieved but with a touch that emphasizes minimizing compression of the synthetic tissue. In many frames the operator deliberately applies only minimal traction to the foam flaps to avoid tearing the small, triangular everted edges; suture passes are therefore conservative and superficial, capturing dermal simulant rather than wide or deep bites.

Sequential stitch placement and progression
The suturing proceeds as a series of interrupted stitches placed in adjacent positions along the right vertical incision. The operator establishes the pattern early and then continues it in a linear progression: a stitch is created, the needle is pulled through so a loop forms, the suture tail is managed by the non‑dominant hand, and the knot is tensioned and secured before moving a short distance along the wound for the next bite. Where prior stitches are already present, new bites are placed immediately adjacent to them, filling gaps and creating an even column of apposed, slightly everted epidermal edges. At times the working direction is toward the cranial (superior) end of the incision — the operator frequently treats the most proximal unstitched segment, then returns to complete and secure that stitch before advancing.

Throughout the run the operator maintains a consistent spacing and bite depth — bites are short, near the wound margins, and intended to approximate the epidermis precisely with slight eversion. There are repeated cycles in which the left hand (or dominant hand depending on frame orientation) manipulates the needle driver to rotate and pass the needle, while the right hand controls tissue and the suture limbs. The coordination is tight: instrument tips converge within a few centimeters, occasionally crossing above the incision to allow the needle arc to be completed and the thread to be drawn through.

Technique refinement and intraoperative adjustments
A number of frames demonstrate technique refinement as the closure matures. Early passes show the needle grasped around the mid‑shaft and positioned to create initial anchor bites; later passes show the operator gripping closer to the swage or tip when a short, controlled bite or a turn for tying is required. The driver is repeatedly repositioned to adjust needle trajectory; these micro‑adjustments are especially apparent as the needle tip is angled medially for an impending bite or withdrawn after passage to prepare the stitch for knot tying.

Edge handling improves as the series continues — forceps more consistently evert and present the dermal margin, and the operator uses the non‑dominant hand to tension the suture tail while the driver prepares the knot throws. Where earlier frames show fingertip approximation, later frames show deliberate use of toothed pickups to stabilize the edge while forming and tightening knots. Knot fashioning evolves from simple manual tightening of loops to coordinated instrument ties in which the driver and forceps are used together to wrap and cinch the suture down securely.

Instrument and hand position evolution
Initial hand approaches often enter the field from above, top‑right, or top‑left depending on the specific camera angle. Once the right vertical incision is engaged, a stable choreography develops: a needle driver sits over or slightly medial to the wound and a pair of forceps occupies the lateral position, immediately adjacent to the bite. The hands remain close — typically within one to five centimeters of each other — to allow precise control of the needle and immediate hand‑to‑hand coordination for knot tying. The needle driver is usually held in the dominant hand and positioned vertical or oblique to the pad; the forceps in the non‑dominant hand grasp tissue, manage the suture tail, or act as a knot pusher during tying.

As stitches accumulate, tasks shift: when placing a new bite the needle driver assumes a leading role and the forceps present tissue; once the needle is removed or the loop formed, both hands work to form a secure knot and trim tails. During tying, instruments often cross above the wound as one instrument passes the suture and the other holds tension. Late in the sequence instrument exchanges occur — scissors or clamps appear intermittently to trim tails, and a ruler is introduced briefly to measure or orient the repair; a bare hand crosses the top of the frame at one point to manipulate a ruler while the sutured line remains undisturbed.

Consistency and technique reliability
Across the procedure the operator adheres to a straightforward simple interrupted technique with a consistent philosophy: small, epidermal‑focused bites that evert the edges; mid‑arc needle passages with controlled wrist rotation; steady suture management to maintain tension without overt tissue strangulation. When the needle grip changes slightly depending on the pass, it represents adaptation to the immediate need — a proximal grip for carrying the curve through the tissue and a more distal grip when precision at the tip is required. There is minimal tissue handling beyond what is necessary to present and approximate the edges; undermining and deep bites are not performed in this simulated scenario.

Where frames show apparent discrepancies — such as early sequences that center instruments over the midline incision without transfixing passes — the narrative is consistent: the operator uses these moments for instrument preparation, suture organization, and positioning before engaging the right lateral wound. Once engaged, the technique remains stable and repeatable.

Completion, knot security and final inspection
As the closure reaches its final stages the operator finishes the last adjacent bites, retrieves the needle after each pass, and performs controlled knot tying for security. Knot fashioning includes instrument throws with the needle driver and forceps working together to form compact square knots that cinch the epidermis into slight eversion. After securing a knot, the surgeon pulls suture tails with forceps and sometimes trims them with scissors or a clamp; in several frames the operator manipulates the knotted suture tails to ensure they lie flat and do not tent the skin simulant.

After the column is completed the operator inspects the line: the edges are coapted, everted consistently along the length, and the lumen between knots is minimal. Previously placed interrupted stitches create a linear row of apposed epidermal margins. The final frames show instrument withdrawal and field appraisal — a ruler is brought in briefly for alignment or measurement, one hand traverses the top of the pad, and the needle driver and forceps are lifted away. There is no evidence of gaping or gross misalignment; sutures are snug but not excessively tight, and the synthetic tissue remains intact without tearing.

Notable adjunct events and limitations
Throughout the case there are brief instances of assistance or instrument exchange: an assistant forcep appears in early frames and then withdraws; a bare hand handles a ruler at the end; scissors or clamps are used intermittently for suture tail management. A few frames suggest repositioning without new passes, indicative of instrument preparation or transfer. A limitation in visual data is that early frames show attention over the central incision with little active engagement there; despite that, the narrative demonstrates that the clinician established and completed the closure along the lateral right incision as the designated working line.

Summary of the final closure state
By the conclusion of the recording the right lateral vertical incision is closed with a tidy, continuous column of sequentially placed interrupted sutures. Each stitch approximates the epidermal margins with slight eversion, spacing is regular, and knots are secure with trimmed tails. The operative rhythm — deliberate needle placement, controlled suture management, instrument‑assisted knot tying — is maintained from the first therapeutic pass through to final inspection. Instruments are withdrawn after confirmation of approximation and knot security, leaving a uniform interrupted closure aligned along the right side of the pad ready for any subsequent dressing or assessment.
