COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents progressive closure of a single, vertical skin incision on a synthetic training pad. From the first frames through the end of the sequence the operator consistently works along that same linear defect, adding successive interrupted stitches from one end of the wound toward the other and finishing each pass before moving to the next marked site. The suture material is a black monofilament attached to a moderately curved surgical needle; the operator repeatedly uses a two‑instrument technique — a needle driver in one hand and fine toothed tissue forceps in the other — to present, pass, retrieve and tension the suture for knotting.

Initial approach and first passes (0–60 s)
At the outset the incision is a 2–3 cm vertical defect centered on the pad with the surrounding simulation markings visible. The operator approaches from a roughly superior/left needle trajectory with the needle driver while the opposing hand stabilizes and elevates the near edge with fine Adson‑style forceps. The curved needle is grasped in the driver near the shaft (not at the eye/swage), oriented so the tip will describe a short arc through skin toward the opposing edge. The free forceps everts and tents the dermal margin to expose a clear bite depth; the driver rotates the needle in a controlled, short arc and advances it through superficial full‑thickness synthetic dermis. The suture is drawn through, forming a loop across the incision, and the suture tails are managed by the forceps in preparation for tying.

Early frames show completion of the first stitch: the needle is withdrawn, the suture loop is tensioned, and the operator readies the ends for knot formation. Hand positions are close and coordinated — the driver typically approaches from above/left while the forceps take the suture and manipulate tissue from below/right. The needle is repeatedly handled midshaft for control; the curve is exploited for short rotational passes rather than long sweeping arcs. Tissue handling during these initial passes is consistently atraumatic — point contact with toothed pickups, minimal crushing, and small bites close to the epidermal margin.

Sequential interrupted placement and technique reinforcement (60–180 s)
After the primary pass the operator proceeds to place additional interrupted stitches along the same vertical incision. Parallel guide lines lateral to the wound indicate planned spacing, and the operator works the superior segment next, moving in a sequential manner along the linear defect. The pattern is systematic: the needle driver presents the needle to the far edge, the opposing forceps lifts and slightly everts the near edge to receive the tip, the needle traverses the dermis in a short controlled arc, and the operator draws the suture through, maintaining tension and preserving edge alignment.

Throughout this stage the operator alternates hand roles occasionally depending on approach angle, but the same two‑instrument coordination persists. Grasping of the needle varies slightly depending on the bite being taken — sometimes nearer the midshaft, sometimes closer to the body of the needle — but control is maintained and the convex surface of the needle is oriented to favor tissue passage. Bites are mostly superficial dermal or epidermal/dermal in depth; in some frames the passage is described as a superficial full‑thickness engagement of the synthetic skin, while in others it is more clearly shallow/subdermal. These slight variations reflect micro‑adjustments in bite depth rather than a change in overall technique.

At the apex/superior end of the wound the operator gives extra attention to edge eversion and approximation. Several frames show a cluster of pre‑placed interrupted sutures inferior to the working zone and the current work advancing just above the last completed throw. The forceps habitually everts the wound margin a little on presentation so that as the suture is tightened the skin edges come into gentle apposition with a controlled everted profile. Needle handling remains deliberate — the driver approaches nearly perpendicular for entry and is then rotated to exit on the far lip. Between passes the driver and forceps often cross over the incision as the operator hands off or repositions the needle and suture.

Mid-procedure refinement and hand choreography (180–300 s)
As the procedure progresses, the operator’s maneuvering becomes more consistent and efficient. The needle is routinely grasped close enough to the curve to allow fine rotation but far enough from the tip to maintain precise trajectory control. The non‑dominant forceps work to stabilize, splint and evert the near edge while the dominant hand controls the needle driver entry and withdrawal. There are repeated small motions: the forceps lifts the edge, the driver advances the needle with a short arc, the tip exits on the opposing side and the suture is pulled through and tensioned.

Instrument positioning varies by a few centimeters as the operator shifts between superior and central segments of the line. Sometimes the driver is superior/right and the forceps inferior/left; other times the orientation is reversed. Despite these shifts the instruments remain in a tight working envelope (typically 1–3 cm apart) so that needle handoffs and suture retrieval can be accomplished quickly. Occasional auxiliary instruments are introduced briefly (a larger hemostat/scissor‑type instrument appears in a few frames) for suture manipulation, but the core technique is always a sequence of needle presentation, tissue purchase, suture retrieval and preparation for knot tying.

Needle extraction, knot tying preparation and consistency checks (300–345 s)
Several frames mid‑to‑late in the video depict the moments after needle passage: the driver pulls the needle out through the exit point, the forceps or the other hand retrieves and steadies the suture tail, and the operator prepares to form a knot. There are repeated displays of needle removal rather than reinsertion in these stages, reflecting completion of each interrupted stitch before moving on. The operator consistently avoids wide undermining and deep bites, keeping closure at the skin/dermal plane to attain precise epidermal approximation.

Throughout this part of the case there are visible premarked reference lines lateral to the incision that guide even spacing of subsequent stitches. The suture tails from prior throws remain visible along the wound, and each new stitch is positioned adjacent to the previous ones to create a regular interrupted closure line. The tensioning of each suture is deliberate but not excessive; small eversion of the edges is maintained to optimize coaptation and minimize inversion.

Final sequence and completion (345–356 s)
In the closing frames the operator places another interrupted bite at the superior portion, rotating the needle to pass medially across the incision while the opposing forceps steadies the near edge. Suture tails are drawn and organized; knots are formed and tightened in sequence as instruments are withdrawn. The last frames show continued coordination — driver above and to the right in some frames with forceps stabilizing/aligning the wound from the upper left — until the needle is finally removed and the suture tails are dressed.

Technique continuity, variability and fidelity
Across the entire sequence the operator uses a consistent interrupted‑stitch technique: presentation of the curved needle in a controlled arc, small dermal/epidermal bites taken close to the wound margins, use of fine toothed forceps to evert and stabilize, and careful tensioning and knotting of each individual stitch before moving to the next. The workflow is sequential and linear: the incision is closed with a series of single interrupted stitches placed at planned intervals along the same wound, using the lateral guide marks as spacing references.

There are minor, expected variations — bite depth shifts subtly between shallow dermal and superficial full‑thickness among frames, grasp points on the needle vary from midshaft to nearer the body, and the relative positions of hands and instruments alternate depending on which side of the wound is being engaged. These differences reflect routine intra‑procedure adjustments to access, angle and control rather than a change in closure strategy. Tissue handling remains atraumatic, with point contact using fine pickups and avoidance of crushing.

Hand and instrument movement patterns
Hand positions evolve systematically as the work progresses along the incision. Early passes show a more superior/left driver approach and inferior/right forceps stabilization. As closure advances the driver and forceps interchange sides depending on the specific bite location, but the two‑instrument choreography is preserved: one instrument everts and stabilizes while the other presents and rotates the needle through. Instruments remain close to the skin surface, meeting over the incision within 1–3 cm, and frequently cross over each other during needle handoffs and suture retrieval. The operator’s dominant hand mostly controls the needle driver; the non‑dominant hand predominantly manipulates tissue and the suture tails, though occasional role switching occurs without disruption to the workflow.

Final state of the wound
By the end of the recorded sequence the vertical incision is populated with evenly spaced interrupted sutures running along the length that was being worked. Each stitch has been placed to approximate the epidermal rims with slight, controlled eversion to promote edge apposition as knots are tied. Multiple suture tails from previously placed interrupted stitches lie alongside the wound, and the most recently placed suture is tensioned and prepared for knotting just prior to the final frames. There is no evidence of layered closure or deep tissue undermining; the closure strategy is focused on precise skin edge approximation using the simple interrupted technique on the single planned incision line.

Overall, the procedure demonstrates methodical, sequential closure of a single vertical incision using a curved needle and black monofilament suture, with consistent two‑instrument technique, measured bite depth appropriate to a skin model, and steady hand coordination to maintain regular spacing and reliable approximation of wound edges throughout the case. Minor variability in needle grasp and bite depth is noted at times but does not alter the fundamental interrupted‑stitch approach that is applied from the first pass to the final throws.
