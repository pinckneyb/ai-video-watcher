Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
This is a competent subcuticular run with solid intradermal tracking, consistent bite size, and reliable edge eversion. Instrument handling is deliberate, with the driver following the needleâ€™s curve and the forceps presenting tissue gently. Progression from inferior to superior is orderly, with tension maintained in-line to seat each loop and preserve approximation. The active line shows no unintended surface breaches. However, the end management is a critical deficiency: cutting the strand after parking the needle without a clear terminal knot leaves the run insecure. Visible extra knot stacks in the lower/mid segment are untidy for a continuous subcuticular and suggest unnecessary conversions. On a live patient, begin with a buried dermal anchor or a lateral lock and finish with a secure, appropriate subcuticular termination (e.g., buried intradermal knot or Aberdeen/sling finish), then trim. Additionally, consider a slightly more oblique needle approach to keep the needle path more parallel to the dermis and reduce the risk of deep bites. Overall, the flow and plane integrity are good, but the finish must be corrected to meet clinical standards.
