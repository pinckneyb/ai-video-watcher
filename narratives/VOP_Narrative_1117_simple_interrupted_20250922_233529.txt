COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad that displays several practice slits, but only one is actually worked on throughout: the short incision located in the upper center of the field between the longer, unused vertical cuts. Across the entire sequence the operator stays with this same wound, building a tidy row of discrete stitches with consistent instrument handling, controlled needle arcs, careful edge eversion with forceps, and instrument ties that are alternated and squared. At a few points the view or description suggests a different orientation (short horizontal versus short vertical) or even momentarily refers to the “longest” central cut; however, the hand positions, instrument approach, and continuity of previously placed knots make it clear the work remains on the same upper‑central incision throughout, while the surrounding longer slits remain untouched.

The session begins with wound purchase and the first pass. The pad’s upper‑center incision sits slightly gaping with crisp edges. The left hand controls the needle holder; the right hand uses fine Adson forceps to present tissue. The curved needle is grasped about two‑thirds of the way from its tip, set at right angles to the skin. The right hand elevates a wound lip with a delicate pick-up that everts the margin without crushing it, and the left hand drives the needle in a smooth arc across the gap. The suture begins to trail on the entry side as the needle emerges from the far edge. The two hands oppose each other across the slit, maintaining a small working distance and a stable view of the dermal margins. The purchase is symmetric, with depth and distance from the cut edge matched on both sides to promote even approximation.

With that first passage completed, the operator transitions to tying. The needle remains attached, but the focus shifts to managing the free limbs. The driver now works just above the incision, and the opposite hand alternates between forceps and the driver to facilitate instrument ties. Loops are formed deliberately, and the long limb is drawn laterally as the driver feeds each throw. The first throw seats down over the center of the wound, and subsequent alternating throws are laid carefully in the opposite direction to square the knot and avoid a slip. The knot is centered directly over the slit, approximating the wound edges without undue tension or blanching. No new bites are taken at this point; the work is devoted to securing the stitch.

Once the knot is secure, scissors arrive from the upper-left to trim the tails neatly and close to the knot. The operator keeps the knot stack stable while cutting, avoiding any upward lift that might loosen it. With that stitch completed, the needle is reloaded for the next placement: it’s grasped near the junction of the proximal third and distal two‑thirds, oriented once again perpendicular to the pad surface. The right hand remains near and slightly inferior-right to the slit, while the left hand makes a controlled approach with scissors, then withdraws and returns with forceps to help with the next bite. The other practice slits remain undisturbed.

The work then proceeds superiorly along the same wound. The driver, now in the right hand again, and the forceps in the left, reposition around the top-center portion of the same incision. The needle is held at the proximal third so that the curve presents an ideal arc across the slit. The left-hand forceps alternately lift the near and far lips, carefully picking up the cut edge to evert but not crush the tissue. A new bite is placed just above the first knot, the needle crossing the gap perpendicularly and emerging at a symmetric distance on the far side. The suture is drawn through smoothly, and the needle is reloaded between edges to maintain an optimal right‑angle approach. The hands oppose each other across the slit throughout, preserving a direct line of sight and avoiding excessive crossing except when necessary to reload.

With the new purchase in place, knot tying resumes in close quarters above the earlier knot. The driver controls the working limb; the other hand manages the free end and brings it to the driver to form each throw. The needle itself lies parked on the long strand and is not re‑driven during the tying sequences. The operator alternates the direction of successive throws, centering each down over the wound line and cinching them with balanced traction. The edges coapt evenly with only minimal eversion and no gaping. Once secure, the scissors return from above to trim the tails, and the knot is left compact and centered. Suture tails are habitually oriented to the right side of the wound, keeping the field organized.

This rhythm—precise bite, instrument tie, careful tail trimming—continues at the same incision. The next pass is placed on the upper‑central portion of this slit. The driver now approaches from the left/superior side, with the curved needle grasped about two‑thirds from the tip and held perpendicular to the surface. The right-hand forceps pick up each margin in turn, everting and presenting the dermal edge. The needle follows a controlled rotational path through the near edge and then the far edge at matched depths, emerging cleanly and leaving a smooth track for the suture. The operator draws the suture through and begins forming loops above the incision, indicating the immediate transition to tying. Again, the needle is not driven further in this moment; it remains attached while the driver uses the suture itself to throw and seat the knot.

Once that knot is completed, the scissors enter to trim the tails. This finishes another stitch on the same line. The instruments stay aligned with the wound, operating directly above it. The driver tends to stay just left or superior to the incision while the other hand crosses from the right to manage the short end and, as needed, brings in scissors from the right/superior quadrant to cut. Throughout, the operator keeps instruments parallel to the wound and avoids dragging them across the adjacent longer slits.

As the closure advances, the operator at one point describes the wound as short and horizontal; this is consistent with a change in camera perspective rather than a change of target. The spatial relationships and the previously placed knot stacks confirm continuity on the same small upper‑center cut between the longer, untouched slits. In this view, a new bite is taken just superior to existing knots. The right hand, holding the driver, positions the needle to pass left-to-right across the incision. The left hand steadies and slightly everts each edge with fine forceps, then helps guide the needle’s arc through tissue. After the needle exits, the left hand carries the free end laterally to pull slack and orient the suture tails to the right. Tension draws the margins into apposition, and the operator prepares immediately to tie with the driver poised above the new bite.

At another juncture, during knot tightening on the upper portion of the same incision, the operator demonstrates good suture management: the driver in the dominant hand controls the working limb, drawing it laterally to the right to cinch each throw and then returning centrally to stack the knot. The non‑dominant hand briefly uses forceps to reorient the needle on the driver after the knot is seated, setting up for the next pass at the same site. This sequence underscores a consistent habit of keeping suture tails to the right of the field, maintaining a clear view, and staging the next action without losing track of where the last knot sits.

As the work approaches the superior end of the incision, the driver hovers just above that top edge. The right hand alternates between forceps and scissors as needed. The needle is grasped near the proximal third, curvature set to drive perpendicular to the surface. The forceps lift the superior wound edges, presenting the entry and exit points for another symmetrical purchase. After the pass, the right hand briefly grips the needle/suture with the forceps to help pull through and to establish a manageable tail for tying. An instrument tie follows immediately. Throws are laid and seated straight down over the wound, with deliberate alternation to achieve a secure square construct. The scissors then cut the tails flush to the knot.

Working at the very top of the line, the operator adds one more stitch, again without touching any other pad slits. The driver grasps the needle at the proximal third with the arc oriented to the operator’s left, indicating a plan to sweep through the near edge and out the far edge with a smooth rotation. During tying at this stage, the wound edges at the top are already well approximated by the underlying row of stitches; the operator maintains coaptation without additional forceps traction by applying symmetric suture tension. Multiple throws complete the knot, and scissors approach from the top-left to trim tails close to the knot while staying centered over the wound.

By the end of this superior segment, the incision presents a neat sequence of knots arrayed along its length. The knot stacks are small and centered; suture tails have been trimmed consistently. The skin edges are coapted linearly with mild, intentional eversion at the stitch points. Slight puckering is visible at each knot—typical of appropriately tightened interrupted skin stitches—and the intervening segments of the wound lie flat without gaping. The working strand and tails remain organized chiefly to the right side of the field, which has helped prevent snagging and kept the view clear during instrument exchange.

There is a brief pause afterward in which no instruments or hands engage the wound. No new needle passes are made, and no new knots are thrown. The camera shows the same short, central incision with several completed stitches and trimmed tails lying to the right. An arm or hand edge appears near the top-right margin at one point, but it does not interact with the wound. The surrounding longer slits—visible on the left, right, and lower center of the pad—remain entirely untouched, confirming that the procedure has consistently focused on the single upper‑center line from start to finish.

Across the entire session, the technique remains consistent and methodical:

- Needle handling: Each pass is executed with the needle grasped at roughly the proximal third to the mid‑distal third, and the arc is driven perpendicular to the skin surface. The operator regrips as needed to preserve a right‑angle approach to both near and far edges. The needle’s rotational path through tissue is smooth and controlled, preventing tearing and ensuring matched depth on both sides of the incision.

- Tissue handling: Adson forceps are used sparingly and precisely. The operator picks up each dermal edge at the cut margin to evert the lip and present the dermal layer. Grips are delicate, avoiding crush injury. The edges are approximated by the suture tension itself during tying; additional traction is only used to present edges for entry/exit.

- Knot tying: Instrument ties are the constant method. Throws are alternated to square each knot, seated deliberately over the wound center. The driver often captures the free end to form loops, while the opposite hand controls slack and positions the short limb. Tension is applied in opposite directions along the incision axis to seat each throw without generating undue eversion or strangulation.

- Spatial control: The driver typically works from a superior or lateral position relative to the stitch being placed. The opposite hand approaches from the counter side to manage tissue or the free limb. The hands remain close and symmetric around the wound. Instruments seldom cross except when forming loops during tying or when briefly reloading the needle. Scissors enter from predictable angles—often from upper-left or right/superior—to trim tails cleanly without disturbing the knot.

- Field organization: Suture tails are consistently directed to the right of the wound, and the working strand is kept short enough to allow precise throws without snagging. The needle is parked safely on the long limb during tying to avoid inadvertent sticks or entanglement.

- Progression along the line: The closure grows from the initial midline placement upward along the same incision, with each subsequent stitch sited just superior to the previous knot. While a midsequence description briefly mentions the “central longest cut” and, later, a “horizontal” orientation, the visual continuity of the knot line, instrument positions, and the persistent lack of activity on other slits demonstrate that the same short upper‑central wound is continually addressed. Any apparent change in orientation reflects camera position rather than a change of target.

By the final moments, the upper‑center incision is fully addressed with a tidy row of discrete knots. The margins are coapted, the eversion is slight and uniform, and there is no sign of gaping between stitches. Knot stacks are compact and centered over the wound line, and the tails are cut to a conservative length. The field is calm, with no instruments crossing the area, and the adjacent practice slits are still undisturbed. The result is a clean, stable closure of the same short central incision using a consistent, stepwise application of the selected suturing technique from first pass to final trim.
