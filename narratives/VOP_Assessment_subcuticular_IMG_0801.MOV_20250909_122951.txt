Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
You demonstrated disciplined hand control, consistent bite spacing, and careful tensioning while advancing from the inferior to the superior end of the rightmost incision. Edge handling was gentle and precise, and overall approximation was reliable, culminating in approximately six discrete secured segments along the line. This reflects good fundamentals of needle loading, perpendicular entry, and symmetric purchase. However, for a true subcuticular closure, the plane integrity must be preserved throughout, and here it was repeatedly compromised by visible mid‑line epidermal punctures and externalized knots. The trajectory was too perpendicular, creating discrete trans‑epidermal stitches rather than a low‑angle, intradermal running path. Improve by keeping the needle shallow and nearly parallel to the skin (10–15°), taking uniform subcuticular bites 1–2 mm from the edge with 4–7 mm travel, advancing in a continuous intradermal track, and finishing with a buried or lateralized end knot (e.g., Aberdeen or buried dermal) with no midline external knots.
