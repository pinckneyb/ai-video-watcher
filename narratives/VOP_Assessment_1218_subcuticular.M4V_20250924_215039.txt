COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure centers on the transverse midline incision located in the upper central portion of the practice pad. From the first to the last segment of the recording the operator returns to and refines closure along that single horizontal wound: placing bites, seating knots, adjusting tension, and trimming tails. Over the course of the video the work on that incision progresses from initial needle passages and suture pull‑throughs to sequential knot tying and final trimming, with repeated, tightly choreographed hand exchanges and instrument repositioning to achieve precise epidermal apposition and slight margin eversion.

Initial approach and first passes
At the outset the operator establishes a compact, bimanual working posture directly over the upper transverse incision. The dominant right hand controls a needle driver and a curved suture needle, frequently grasped about the mid‑shaft to proximal two‑thirds of the curvature to allow controlled rotation through the synthetic dermis. The nondominant left hand holds fine tissue forceps (Adson‑style or toothed pickup) and approaches from the lateral/inferior quadrant to stabilize and tent the adjacent edge. Early needle entries are shallow-to-mid dermal bites oriented perpendicular or slightly oblique to the incision, using the curve of the needle to create predictable arcs from near edge to far edge. The forceps retract and evert the margin lightly to ensure the epidermal rims meet with slight eversion when the stitch is seated.

Throughout these opening frames the hands work in close proximity — usually only a few centimeters apart — with the instruments frequently crossing above the wound in order to permit the short arc rotations required of the curved needle. The needle driver holds the needle so the tip is directed toward the skin surface on the intended entry point while small wrist rotations feed the needle through the tissue. The left hand gives counter‑traction, tenting the lateral flap to guide entry and receiving or controlling the suture tail as it is pulled through.

Sequential bite placement and stitch seating
Once initial passes have been made, the operator advances along the incision in a methodical fashion. Each pass follows a consistent choreography: the left forceps grasp and slightly evert the near edge, the right needle driver rotates the curved needle through the opposite rim, the suture is pulled until the needle exits, and the hands coordinate to seat the loop for knot tying. Occasional frames show the operator adjusting the needle grip — sometimes nearer the swage or at the mid‑shaft depending on the remaining curvature and the bite location — to optimize control as the needle completes its arc.

As the procedure continues, several separate interrupted stitches are placed across the length of the incision. The operator deliberately spaces passes so that the wound edges are approximated with minimal gaping and a slight outward evert of the margins, which is appropriate for epidermal edge apposition. The forceps hold the tissue atraumatically and the needle passes are superficial‑to‑mid dermal on the silicone model; the operator avoids excessive traction, preserving the tissue architecture.

Knot tying, tightening, and tail management
Following each needle pass the sequence shifts to securing the suture: the operator brings the needle driver and forceps into close, coordinated motion to place throws and tighten the knot. Hand positions converge directly over the wound, with the right hand typically on the right or center superior field and the left hand crossing from the left to control tails and tissue. Knot tightening is performed with short, deliberate wrist motions, and the operator palpably monitors tension to maintain edge apposition without strangulation.

After securing a knot the assistant instrument — occasionally a pair of small scissors, a Kelly clamp, or a second needle driver — is brought in from the lateral lower quadrant to trim the suture tail. The operator alternates between stabilizing the knot with forceps and snipping tails with scissors, again keeping motions compact and focused within the small working zone. These finishing maneuvers repeat for each interrupted stitch along the incision: seat the knot, confirm approximation and eversion, and trim tails to tidy the field.

Progression toward the cephalad end and refinement
Midway through the recording the operator consistently finishes bites toward the cephalad end of the same upper incision. The sequence of grips and passes remains stable: the needle is frequently grasped near the body for rotational control, and the left hand consistently provides counter‑traction and stabilization. At times the operator pauses with the needle driver holding suture tails while the forceps manipulate tissue, ensuring each knot maintains the desired apposition before the tail is trimmed.

The work pattern shows a steady progression from central portions of the incision toward its cephalad-most extent. As each new bite is made and secured, the operator reorients hand position subtly — sometimes the right hand moves slightly more medial or lateral to optimize needle arc, and the left hand may shift inferiorly or laterally to achieve the correct angle for instrument exchange and knot control. These micro‑adjustments preserve the narrow working envelope over the same horizontal wound without wandering to other defects on the pad.

Periods of instrument interchange and trimming focus
Interspersed with needle passes are periods where the operator focuses on knot management, tail trimming, and minor adjustments. During those intervals both hands remain adjacent to the incision; the needle holder may be used to tension or hold the suture while the scissors come in from below to cut tails. The left forceps are sometimes exchanged for a blunt scissor or a second needle holder when a more stable grip is needed for trimming. Throughout, the operator maintains close visual and manual control of the wound margins to ensure the everted approximation is preserved as knots are tightened and tails removed.

Consistency of technique and occasional deviations
Across the timeline the core technique is consistent: small, perpendicular-to-oblique bites taken with a curved needle, tissue held and everted by forceps, and individual stitches secured and trimmed. The operator’s needle grips are conservative — generally mid‑shaft or about two‑thirds from the swage — enabling precise rotation and minimizing needle tip wobble. Hand positions remain compact, with instruments crossing above the wound to facilitate precise arcs.

There are brief sequences where needle motion and the length of suture visible suggest longer continuous passages; in those moments the footage shows the suture strand being drawn through successive bites and a longer loop of material present across the lower incision. However, in practice these intervals are followed by knot tying and individual tail trimming on the upper incision. Those scenes are interpreted as transient and do not alter the prevailing pattern of placing discrete stitches and tying them individually along the same horizontal wound; the operator returns to the interrupted‑style handling and finishes each stitch before long pauses or tail trimming.

Evolving hand dynamics as work nears completion
As the closure nears completion the operator’s hands become even more coordinated and compact. The right hand frequently assumes a vertical or slightly oblique orientation above the incision to withdraw a needle or hold suture tails; the left hand comes in from the lateral‑inferior quadrant to receive the needle, hold the knot, or cut tails. Instruments are brought in from predictable approaches — scissors from the lower‑left, forceps from the left‑lower quadrant — minimizing the need for broad repositioning and maintaining a steady visual field.

When completing the most cephalad stitches, the operator uses short, controlled wrist motions to tighten knots, watching for over‑eversion or puckering and making small adjustments to tension as needed. Each knot is seated deliberately, and tails are trimmed close enough to be secure but long enough to avoid untying during handling. The synthetic pad tissue remains well approximated throughout these maneuvers, with the operator favoring minimal trauma and consistent margin alignment.

Final appraisal and finished closure
By the end of the sequence the entire length of the upper transverse wound is uniformly approximated with slight outward eversion of the epidermal margins. The row of previously placed stitches along this horizontal incision appears continuous and cohesive: each bite is seated within superficial-to-mid dermal tissue, knots are snug without excessive tension, and suture tails have been trimmed in a controlled fashion. Hands withdraw in a coordinated manner after the last trimming and knot tightening, leaving a neat linear closure across the top‑center of the pad.

Spatially, the final state reflects the repeated hand dynamics established throughout the procedure: the dominant hand used the needle driver to control needle trajectory and hold tails, while the nondominant hand employed forceps to evert and stabilize tissue as knots were formed. Movements remained tightly constrained to the small working zone above the wound, with instruments crossing as needed to facilitate needle arcs and tight knot security.

Overall, the operator demonstrates a disciplined, reproducible approach to closing this horizontal incision: deliberate needle grips, precise paired hand movements to evert and stabilize tissue, methodical knot tying and trimming, and incremental progression from one end of the wound to the other until clean, well‑approximated skin edges are achieved. Any brief visual suggestions of continuous running material are transient and are followed by the same pattern of discrete knot formation and tail management, resulting in a consistent, tidy epidermal closure along the upper transverse incision.
