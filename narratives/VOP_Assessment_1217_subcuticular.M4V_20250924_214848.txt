COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video follows the closure of a single vertical skin incision near the top center of a synthetic practice pad. From the first frames through the final moments, the operator works along this single linear defect, repeatedly placing and securing simple interrupted skin sutures to approximate the epidermal and dermal edges. Movements are deliberate and repetitive, reflecting a standard interrupted-suture technique carried out in a stepwise, consistent fashion with small superficial bites that aim to evert the wound margins and achieve precise edge apposition.

At the outset (0–14 s) the procedure begins with classic bimanual control: the left hand holds fine tissue forceps to lift and present the near wound edge, while the right hand brings a curved, swaged needle in a needle driver toward the far edge. The needle is grasped just proximal to the driver’s jaws and oriented so its point will enter the lateral wound margin and sweep across the defect to exit on the medial side. The forceps provide countertraction and elevation of the epidermal/dermal junction, allowing a shallow, controlled bite through the simulated tissue. The first needle pass is made perpendicular to the incision plane; the suture begins to traverse the skin and a loop is formed as the driver withdraws.

Through the early 15–29 s and 30–44 s segments the operator repeats this pattern on the same incision. The left forceps remain adjacent to the incision, consistently used to evert and stabilize tissue; the right-handed needle driver controls the curved needle’s arc. The needle is typically grasped a short distance from the swage or near the distal shaft depending on the frame, and rotated through full or shallow-thickness dermal bites. Instrument spacing stays tight, usually within 1–3 cm across the wound, so the tips meet directly over the planned bite site. The suture filament trails behind the needle and is managed close to the field as each pass is completed.

In the 45–59 s and 60–74 s intervals the work continues on the same top-center vertical incision. Needle placement remains superficial—aimed to capture dermal and subepidermal tissue without deep fascial purchase on the synthetic model. The forceps consistently evert the edges, producing slight ridge or eversion as the suture is tightened. The needle driver approaches from slightly variable angles (often superior-lateral or medial depending on the exact bite), but the driver and forceps remain opposing to allow perpendicular or slightly oblique needle entry. By the end of these frames the operator has a series of interrupted bites along the length of the incision, with fresh loops and tails being handled in preparation for tying.

The sequence between 75–104 s shows continued sequential placement of interrupted stitches adjacent to previously placed ones. The hand alignment is steady: forceps medially/left and needle driver laterally/right in many frames, though occasionally the orientation is reversed depending on approach and bite location. Needles are held variably — sometimes near the tip, sometimes mid-shaft — reflecting moment-to-moment adjustment to control needle curvature and arc. The operator consistently uses small rotational wrist movements to bring the needle through the skin, withdrawing the suture loop and pulling the thread to lay the loop flush against the epidermis in preparation for tying. At times a blunt instrument or an assistant-like hand appears briefly to control the free suture tail while the driver completes a pass.

Between 105–149 s the same pattern is evident on the same incision, though the focus shifts toward finishing bites closer to the superior end. The operator occasionally holds the needle slightly different in the driver for more control (shorter grip nearer the body of the needle), enabling shallow arc passes at the superior-most margin. Left-hand forceps continue to provide fine adjustment of tissue edges and maintain eversion. During this mid-procedure stage the operator is consistent in taking shallow dermal bites at the epidermal margin, pulling the suture through to form a loop, and preparing the ends for knot-tying. Movements are economical and localized within a narrow working zone immediately adjacent to the wound.

Frames from 150–179 s and 180–209 s document additional passes and completion of stitches progressively moving along the incision line from its mid-portion toward the superior end. The operator’s hands remain tightly coordinated—often within 1–2 cm of each other—with the forceps holding and everting the near edge while the needle driver brings the curved needle from the opposing side. Needle rotation through the tissue is controlled and follows the curvature of the instrument rather than forcing straight passes; this preserves tissue integrity in the model and produces consistent superficial purchase. Suture loops are drawn through and laid along the pad surface for subsequent tightening. No deep tissue manipulation or undermining is attempted; the strategy remains epidermal/dermal approximation.

From 210–239 s the narrative shows additional, nearly identical cycles of needle placement and suture pulling. In these frames the operator is working slightly superior within the same incision line and is observed to rotate the needle driver more deliberately, often grasping the needle a little closer to the swage to control the exit angle. The left forceps continue to evert and stabilize the skin; the right-hand driver completes the arc to bring the needle tip through the opposing margin. As each loop is completed it is tensioned and prepared for knotting. Prior interrupted stitches are visible inferior to the working field, providing a visual map of progress along the single incision.

Between 240–269 s and continuing through 270–299 s the operator begins to finish and secure bites at the superior-most portion of the same central vertical incision. The workflow incorporates not only needle passage but also subsequent knot manipulation and suture tail management. In several consecutive frames the needle has already been passed and the operator uses a combination of the forceps and needle driver — and at times fingertip control — to tighten and seat knots. A small amount of puckering or ridge-like eversion is apparent at sites where sutures have been tightened, consistent with correct everting bites intended to bring epidermal edges into apposition.

The 300–329 s interval shows a notable transition in handling: in some frames the operator shifts from exclusively using the needle driver to occasional finger or fingertip manipulation of the suture near the superior nail or pad edge. The needle itself is not always visible in these frames, suggesting that certain passes have been completed and the tensioning/knotting phase is underway. The left hand is sometimes used to hold the suture loop and manipulate tension while the right hand arranges the free tail and readies the instrument for trimming or securing the knot. Throughout, the working field remains the same vertical incision; previously placed sutures run inferiorly and inform spacing and placement of further bites.

From 330–344 s and into 345–359 s the operator continues augmenting the closure at the proximal end of the incision. The left index fingertip is occasionally used to stabilize the skin immediately adjacent to the stitch site, allowing the driver to pass the needle with greater precision for the final superficial bites. The needle driver approaches from upper-left to upper-right in different frames, reflecting small positional adjustments, but both hands stay within a narrow window over the wound. The needle is repeatedly grasped near mid-shaft for controlled rotation and smooth traversal of the dermis; the forceps maintain tension on the opposing edge to guide each bite and to prevent inversion.

In the final seconds (360–361 s) the operator is concentrated at the superior-most end of the same vertical incision, tending to a small knot or tissue puck adjacent to previously placed interrupted sutures. Only one instrument-bearing hand is clearly visible in the very last frames, with a needle driver or fine forceps approaching from the upper-left and appearing to manipulate suture material or a knot at the wound margin. The needle shaft itself is not visible in these closing frames, a limitation of the view, but the instrument tip is positioned adjacent to the wound margin as if securing or tightening the proximal stitch. This final manipulation aligns with the overall pattern observed throughout the video: sequential placement of interrupted superficial dermal bites, followed by suture tensioning and knot management concentrated at the superior edge of the same incision.

Throughout the procedure the suturing pattern is consistent: simple interrupted stitches placed sequentially along the length of the single vertical defect. Bites are shallow and located close to the epidermal margin to provide dermal purchase and slight eversion of the edges, while avoiding deep fascial engagement — an approach appropriate for superficial skin closure in a simulated model. Needle handling is uniformly controlled: the curved needle is gripped variably near the mid-shaft or nearer the tip depending on the bite and angle required; small wrist rotations and controlled arcs are used to pull the needle through tissue in a smooth motion. The left hand predominantly stabilizes and everts the near edge with fine-point forceps, and the right hand controls needle passage with a needle driver. Occasionally, the operator uses a fingertip to steady tissue or to manage suture tails during knot tying. Instrument crossing occurs regularly over the incision, with tips meeting at the planned bite site to ensure perpendicular entry and secure purchase.

Spatially, the hands and instruments remain tightly localized over the wound, moving only a few centimeters as work progresses from the midportion of the incision toward the proximal/superior end. Approaches vary between superior-lateral and medial-lateral depending on which bite is being taken, but the operator consistently maintains opposing hand positions to allow precise countertraction and needle control. Knot management and tail trimming are integrated into the closing sequence, with the operator alternating between needle passage and suture securing in an efficient, stepwise manner.

By the end of the recording the incision is approximated along its length with evenly spaced, superficial interrupted stitches. The edges display slight eversion where sutures have been tightened, and prior stitches lie inferior to the final knot manipulations at the superior margin. The final frames show the operator attending to a small knot or puck adjacent to the upper end of the incision, adjusting and securing remaining suture material to complete closure. Visibility limitations in a few late frames obscure the needle itself, but the sequence of events and instrument positions indicate that the suturing cycle — bite, draw-through, tension, tie — has been consistently and systematically applied from the start to the finish of the procedure.
