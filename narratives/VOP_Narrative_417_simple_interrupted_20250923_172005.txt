COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The closure unfolds on a single, left‑sided laceration that steps and changes direction as it climbs the pad—beginning as a short vertical limb in the lower-left quadrant, turning through a small horizontal corner near the bottom-left anchor, then bending into an oblique segment that continues up toward the upper-left region, and finally meeting a slightly longer, left‑of‑center vertical segment that is completed toward its superior end. Across these changing orientations, the operator maintains a consistent interrupted technique, placing precise, perpendicular dermal bites with careful edge eversion and then securing each pass with instrument ties. The sequence shows a disciplined cadence: bite, regrip, guide exit, pull through, cinch, and square down a knot, punctuated by brief checks of approximation and eversion before moving to the next segment of the same line.

The closure begins at the inferior end of the left‑of‑center vertical portion of this stepped laceration. With the curved needle held at the junction of the proximal and middle third, the driver stands just to the patient’s left of the split, oriented perpendicular to the skin. Opposite, a green‑gloved right hand uses fine pickups to gently lift and evert the right wound edge near the incision’s lower apex. The bite is prepared from left to right in a true orthogonal arc, opposing instruments meeting over the gap to present the dermis and control exit. The tissue is handled delicately—no crush or excessive traction—and the thread trails freely behind the needle as the very first pass on this vertical segment is initiated and drawn across at the inferior third. Throughout this first entry, the hands oppose one another cleanly across the defect, maintaining a few millimeters of working distance and a squared, perpendicular trajectory that sets the tone for the rest of the case.

With that first bite seated, attention pivots to the corner where this stepped laceration turns horizontally near the lower‑left anchor point. This is a small horizontal limb that meets a vertical edge—a location prone to tension and dog‑ear formation—so it is secured early. The right hand alternates between needle driver and scissors; the left hand briefly parks a driver at the pad’s left margin to manage the short tail. No new needle passes are made here; rather, the previously placed stitch at the corner is converted into a secure knot using instrument ties. The long limb is drawn across the field to the right to set the throw, the driver catches the loop and advances it squarely down over the incision, and final frames show scissors approaching to trim the tail once the knot is snugged flush to the corner. Edge control is achieved entirely through suture tension; no forceps are used here, consistent with a delicate, atraumatic strategy for thin corner tissue.

The operator then returns to the vertical limb at the lower‑left quadrant—proximal to the corner—to place and secure another interrupted stitch. The right hand holds the needle driver above this small slit, aligns the needle perpendicular to the skin, and drives the arc across both edges. No forceps are used in this brief series; the left hand steadies the pad and manages the free suture end. After a clean passage, the driver transitions to tying: loops are formed, the knot is guided down just lateral to the slit, and the stitch is seated with the knot lying slightly off to the side to avoid strangling the wound edge. The hands cross smoothly while tying—the driver guiding loops from superior-left of the slit while the off hand maintains gentle tail tension inferiorly—delivering a compact, square knot centered over the repair.

Several contiguous frames then focus on securing that same stitch. The curved needle remains on the long end but is deliberately kept out of the field while the right hand uses the driver to form and seat consecutive throws. The left hand alternates between grasping the short end and briefly introducing an auxiliary instrument from the left to help control strand orientation. The strands are kept separated and oriented roughly perpendicular to the repair while each throw is advanced down in a controlled, incremental manner. Final pulls are made laterally across the wound—one hand drawing right, the other left—so the cinch approximates the edges without rolling them inward. The needle is occasionally regripped to reposition it safely out of the working area, but no reinsertion occurs. By the end of these tying sequences, the small vertical limb in the lower-left quadrant sits neatly apposed, the knot centered and stable.

Back at the horizontal corner where the horizontal limb meets the vertical step, the operator performs final knot seating and verification. The right hand (green glove) holds the driver over the corner while the left hand introduces forceps briefly to steady the near edge, then switches to control the suture tail. No new bites are taken at this location; the aim is to confirm the corner stitch is solid and the edges are precisely aligned. Several throws are snugged in succession, the direction of tension alternating to keep the knot square and low, and the wound at the corner lies flush with the adjacent vertical segment, without gapping or inversion at the step.

Having secured the lower segments, the surgeon progresses to the oblique portion of this same laceration as it angles up toward the mid‑left of the pad. This segment has a small triangular notch/apex. The right hand holds the needle driver while the left hand uses picks to present the dermis, gently everting each margin prior to passage. The needle is grasped at the proximal third and enters perpendicular to the surface; the driver then re‑grips to complete the bite through the far side. The pass crosses the gap cleanly, the suture is drawn through, and tension is applied away from the wound to avoid lifting the edges. The result is precise, symmetric purchase of dermal tissue on each side of the oblique cut, with the edges approximated and slightly everted—ideal for dermal healing and minimizing step‑off across the angled portion.

The oblique work continues a short distance superior to that apex. Two prior stitches are visible in this zone, and the goal is to advance the closure up the same angled line. Here, no forceps are used; instead, the right hand manages the free suture end to stabilize the right edge while the left hand, with the driver, orients the needle to pass from right to left, again with a perpendicular arc relative to the skin. As the needle exits the left edge, the pull of the strand assists in drawing the edges together, creating gentle eversion through the curvature and the controlled tension of the pass. The operator alternates the positions of the hands—crossing inferior to pull slack, then moving lateral to maintain even tension—so that the suture seats evenly without twisting the edges. This maintains a consistent interrupted rhythm along the oblique trajectory.

From there, the surgeon returns toward the left‑of‑center vertical portion of the same laceration, where several bites have already been placed. At midline, the focus is on tying down the most recent stitch. The left hand often holds the driver superior‑left of the wound, functioning as the post, while the right hand alternates between a second driver and briefly deployed tissue forceps to ensure the edges stay aligned as the knot is formed. The curved needle remains attached to the long limb but is not driven; it is simply kept safe and out of the way while instrument ties are performed. The long limb is drawn laterally and inferiorly during throws so the knot advances directly over the newly approximated portion and cinches without rolling the edge. When the knot is seated, the instruments are withdrawn and the line at this vertical segment shows smooth approximation where the knot now lies.

With that area secured, a fresh bite is taken at the superior end of this same left‑central vertical segment. The left hand with the driver stands just to the wound’s left and slightly above the superior apex; the right hand uses forceps to lift and evert the right edge. The needle—held at the proximal third—enters on the left, follows a left‑to‑right arc in a plane perpendicular to the wound edges, and the right‑hand forceps assist in guiding the exit, protecting and lifting the far side dermis. As the suture is drawn through, a long working strand remains; previous throws are evident below, confirming a steady upward progression along this vertical limb. The instruments oppose each other squarely across the gap, and the driver sits slightly superior while the forceps hold just inferior/medial to the exit point, controlling the bite until the segment sits neatly apposed.

The operator then revisits the oblique portion a bit higher up to place and secure another interrupted stitch. The right hand holds the needle driver for passage; the left hand alternates between pickups for edge eversion and managing the free tail during tying. The needle is grasped a little proximal to the tip, presented perpendicular to the surface, and a fine, symmetric bite is taken near the epidermal edge on each side. After withdrawal, the driver regrips near the knot to facilitate instrument ties. Several throws are placed, alternately tensioning the loop and the free end to snug the knot without rotating it off axis. The tying is done immediately adjacent to the wound margin to maintain control; cutting is not shown here, but the knot is seated and checked for security. Throughout, the two hands remain close together and centered over the same oblique segment, crossing over the wound as needed while keeping the suture tail organized and clear of the next working area.

Moving back up to the superior end of the left‑central vertical limb, the just‑placed bite is tied. The left hand/driver holds the short, post limb near the wound; the right hand wraps the long strand around the driver, alternating throws to deliver a compact, square knot. The curved needle remains attached to the long end but is parked off to the right during this tying sequence. No additional tissue bites are taken here; the purpose is to finalize this interrupted stitch at the top of the vertical component. Throws are advanced down with care, the knot is seated directly over the superior apex of the wound, and the strands are oriented opposite each other across the incision so final tension draws left and right evenly rather than dragging the edges in one direction.

At the very top of the oblique limb—now in the upper‑left quadrant—the operator performs a tightening and set of previously placed passes. The left hand holds the driver just superior and slightly medial to the line while the right hand guides the free strand across, tensioning to snug the existing bites and bring the edges into final, consistent contact. The edges show modest eversion and a small residual gap centrally that narrows as tension is applied. In these frames no new bite is created; instead, the sequence shows the familiar step of consolidating approximation before the next pass or just after tying. The suture line here can momentarily appear as a series of loops running along one side with crossings on the other; however, the actions depicted—no new needle passage, just controlled tensioning and set—are fully consistent with the interrupted technique used throughout and reflect routine strand management rather than a change in pattern.

Across the entire repair, the hand positions exhibit a methodical rhythm that adapts to the wound’s bends while preserving a consistent relationship to the edges. During entry, the driver sits on the patient’s left of the wound with the needle perpendicular to the surface; the assisting hand stands across the gap to evert the far edge and guide the exit. During tying, roles invert: the driver holds the post limb near the wound and becomes the tying instrument while the opposite hand manages the long end, pulls laterally to shape the knot path, and alternates tension across throws to keep the knot square. Where forceps are omitted (notably during several oblique passes and lower‑left vertical tying sequences), edge control is achieved by precise needle angle and suture tension rather than direct tissue grasping—consistent with good tissue stewardship on a training pad’s thin cutaneous “dermis.”

Spatially, the instruments never lose the wound; even when a limb or a corner is secured, the next move advances along the same line. Work concentrates first on the inferior third of the left‑of‑center vertical portion, then secures the adjacent corner at the horizontal step, then stabilizes and ties a stitch on the lower‑left vertical limb just above the corner. With the inferior closure foundation set, the surgeon moves into the oblique segment: first at the small notch/apex, then just superior to it, gradually climbing the angled line with well‑spaced, symmetric bites. Next, the surgeon revisits the main vertical pillar of the same laceration in the left‑central pad—tying a midline stitch, placing another at the superior end, and then tying that superior pass. Finally, at the most superior oblique segment, a tightening sequence consolidates edge apposition, confirming uniform eversion and strand lay before proceeding or concluding.

Technically, the approach is consistent throughout. Bites are perpendicular to the skin surface, passes are balanced left‑to‑right with the needle held at its proximal third for optimal control, and eversion is achieved by a combination of fine pickup assistance (where used) and the natural curvature of the needle supported by careful, bidirectional tension on the suture. Knots are formed with instrument ties using alternating throws, seated with measured downward pressure so they lie flush without strangulating the edges. During tying, the needle itself is conscientiously parked off to the side to protect the field and the operator’s hands. Where the corner is involved, the surgeon prefers to secure that angle early and confirm it remains anatomically aligned as adjacent segments are closed—an approach that minimizes distortion at the step and helps distribute tension evenly along the stepped geometry.

By the end of the sequence, the stepped, left‑sided laceration—from its lower‑left vertical limb through the horizontal corner, up the oblique midsection, and into the left‑central vertical extension—shows a series of neatly placed, well‑spaced interrupted stitches. Knots sit just off the incision line, the edges are uniformly approximated with mild eversion, and there is no visible gapping along any segment. The superior portions have been tightened and set after tying, and inferior stitches at the corner and lower vertical limb have been fully secured and, where shown, trimmed. The overall impression is of a continuous, coherent closure along one complex laceration: carefully planned, methodically executed, and internally consistent in technique despite the wound’s changes in orientation.
