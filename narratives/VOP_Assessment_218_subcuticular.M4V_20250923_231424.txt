COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a focused, methodical closure of the long horizontal skin incision that runs across the lower third of the silicone pad, just above the inferior edge. From the outset the operator establishes a consistent rhythm and working geometry: the dominant hand controls the needle driver while the non-dominant hand provides precise tissue control with Adson-style forceps or an assisting clamp. Over the course of the recording the team repeatedly returns to the same left–right linear cut and advances closure along its length, alternating between needle passage, suture management, knot formation, and occasional trimming — all while preserving direct opposition between driver and forceps and maintaining perpendicular needle entry and slight eversion at each bite.

0:00–0:14 — The procedure begins at the right end of the lowermost horizontal slit. The right hand holds the needle driver and presents a curved, taper-point needle that is loaded roughly two-thirds from the tip so that the natural arc can be traversed with a wrist-driven motion from right to left. The left hand lifts and everts the near wound margin with forceps to present the dermal edge for an orthogonal entry. The needle tip is presented square to the skin, advanced through the dermis along a controlled arc, and then passed across to the opposite edge; the suture strand becomes visible across the gap as the needle is retrieved and the thread is drawn through. Hands remain close and symmetrical around the incision with instruments crossing to create a tight triangular working field on the right corner of the slit.

0:15–0:44 — Attention remains at the same right-sided portion of the lower horizontal line. The operator consistently grasps the needle at the proximal third-to-half in some passes and at roughly two-thirds in others, re-choking the driver as needed to maintain a perpendicular approach. The left hand continues to lift and evert the dermal margin and intermittently stabilizes the pad or manages the free tail. After a symmetric bite across the slit, the needle is pulled through and repositioned for the next pass. At times the left hand briefly holds the suture while the right hand re-loads the needle; later frames show instrument-tie technique employed, with the right-hand needle holder forming instrument throws while the left controls the standing end. The geometry stays consistent — opposing instruments a few millimeters from the wound edge and suture loops cast centrally over the incision for knot formation.

0:45–1:04 — The pattern repeats as the team progresses slightly leftward along the same lower horizontal incision. A new bite is taken with the needle grasped at the proximal/mid third and oriented perpendicular to the surface. The non-dominant forceps evert the far edge while the driver follows the curvature to exit in the wound. The passes remain dermal and symmetric, with minimal crush injury to the simulated tissue. The surgeon occasionally manages suture slack with a clamp or hemostat while reloading the needle; the hands remain opposed across the incision with clear visual access.

1:05–1:29 — Stitch placement continues, and in several sequences the right-hand driver is seen completing the pass and then converting the instrument into the knot‑tying implement. The left hand alternates between forceps for edge presentation and scissors to trim tails after knotting. There is an emphasis on precisely approximated bites with slight eversion — a consistent effort to achieve edge-to-edge alignment and good apposition within the dermal plane. Throughout these frames the working field remains focused on the same lower horizontal slit; other markings on the pad are left untouched.

1:30–1:49 — The operator shifts to a short transverse incision located more centrally on the lower pad in these frames, but instrument posture, needle orientation, and the handling mechanics are the same. These moments appear transient and preparatory: the team checks needle orientation, re-grips the needle for optimal leverage, and rehearses the wrist rotation required for subsequent passes. After each pass the suture is pulled through to working length and the instrument geometry is restored to the familiar opposing driver/forceps configuration.

1:50–2:04 — Shortly after, the hands return to the lower horizontal line, and attention focuses again on advancing closure. In these frames the right-hand driver holds the needle at the proximal third, but rather than immediately driving another bite the surgeon uses the driver to create instrument throws and tie down a previously placed stitch. The left hand manages the short tail beneath the knot while the right-hand driver casts loops above the incision and slides each throw down to secure a square knot. This alternation between placing a stitch and securing it with multiple instrument throws repeats intermittently as the closure progresses toward the midline.

2:05–2:19 — The team places additional bites along the right-to-left axis of the lower horizontal slit. During these passes, the left hand frequently stabilizes the near edge and sometimes brings scissors in to cut tails after knot formation. Needle positions vary from mid-body to two-thirds from the tip depending on the bite orientation, but the needle always re-orients to maintain a perpendicular approach and consistent arc through dermal tissue. Hands cross the wound in a small, controlled space with suture loops lying across the incision while tension is applied to approximate the edges.

2:20–2:34 — Work continues with additional interrupted passes placed sequentially along the same line. After a stitch is tied, the operator often uses scissors to trim the tails close to the knot; the trimmed ends are cleared from the field and the driver is reloaded to resume the next bite slightly further along the slit. The non-dominant hand typically positions just inferior to the incision or slightly lateral depending on the bite, preserving opposition and enabling symmetric bites on either side of the line.

2:35–2:49 — As closure progresses into the left half of the lowermost incision, the pattern of controlled perpendicular needle entry and slight eversion is maintained. The needle is reloaded at different grip points (proximal third, mid‑body, two-thirds) to follow the curvature and maintain optimal arc across each bite. The left hand continues to present the dermal margins and manage standing ends during tying. In several frames a suture tail from a prior pass lies over the wound and is managed by the assisting forceps while the driver passes the needle for the next stitch.

2:50–3:04 — The surgeon places a bite near the left segment of the same lowest incision, with the right hand advancing the needle from a superior approach and the left stabilizing the inferior lip. Once the needle is through, the thread is drawn through and held to set appropriate tension. No knot is tied in some of these passes immediately — rather the surgeon draws the suture through and either prepares to tie or to continue with the next pass, depending on local approximation and tension.

3:05–3:19 — After a sequence of interrupted bites and occasional instrument ties, there are frames showing a continuous, trailing suture visible extending from a previous pass near the right half of the lower horizontal cut. That strand indicates an area where either a previous stitch had been left long for subsequent knotting or where the operator is transitioning between placing interrupted stitches and running sequential passes. Regardless, the technique applied at each bite remains the same: perpendicular entry, dermal-level depth, slight eversion, and symmetric exits to ensure the wound edges approximate without inversion.

3:20–3:34 — The work shifts momentarily with instruments off the line in order to prepare the needle or re-position materials, and one brief sequence shows no active needle handling over the pad — a short setup or pause. This pause is followed by a return to the horizontal slit where the surgeon re-loads the needle and resumes advancing closure along the next available gap between previous bites. Hands remain lateral to the wound during these intervals, preserving the sterile field and maintaining proximity for immediate resumption.

3:35–3:49 — In the final active segments, the team continues alternating passes and knots along the lower horizontal incision. The right-hand driver repeatedly re-grips and reorients the needle to maintain perpendicular bite angles. The left hand alternates between presenting the dermal margin, holding the standing end for instrument throws, and trimming the tails after knots are snug. There is evidence of completed stitches spaced evenly along the length of the slit; each knot is seated centrally and trimmed as needed.

3:50–4:34 (final frames through the brief pause at 270–274 s) — The sequence concludes with the team preparing for the next bite: the needle and needle driver are staged to re-enter the field while the non-dominant hand holds the suture tail taught. A short pause shows instruments lateral to the wound and scissors rested nearby. Overall, the wound along the lower edge of the pad is now substantially approximated: multiple stitches have been placed from right to left, a mixture of interrupted passes and instrument-tied throws have been used to secure the repair, and trimmed knots lie along the incision at regular intervals. Slight eversion is preserved at each bite, and the dermal alignment is consistently maintained. The final working posture shows the needle holder prepared to place one additional bite but with the majority of the linear closure already achieved.

Throughout the case the team demonstrates a disciplined set of movements: the needle is consistently presented perpendicular to the skin, forceps provide controlled eversion at each entry point, and the needle driver is re-choked and repositioned as required to follow the needle curve and maintain symmetric bite depths. Hands work in opposition across the line with the driver typically superior/right of the incision and forceps inferior/left (or vice versa depending on the specific bite), crossing minimally across the wound when necessary for knot formation. Instrument ties are performed in several sequences to secure stitches already passed; scissors are used intermittently to trim tails close to snug knots.

A few frames show activity over other incisions or brief periods without a needle in hand; these moments are transient and appear to be preparation, assessment, or instrument exchange rather than a change of focus. Taken as a continuous narrative, the entire video tracks systematic closure of the same long horizontal lower-third incision: incremental bites placed in sequence, deliberate suture management with alternating passes and secure instrument-tied throws, and final trimming to leave a neat line of approximating knots with slight eversion and consistent dermal-level purchase. The incision is largely closed with well-approximated edges and placed knots; the field is clean and the operator is poised to place any remaining final throws.
