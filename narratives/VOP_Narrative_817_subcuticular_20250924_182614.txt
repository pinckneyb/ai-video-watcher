COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator selecting a single, straight horizontal laceration on the silicone skin pad near the lower-left quadrant and committing to close it from its left end toward the right with standard interrupted skin sutures and instrument ties. From the outset, the workshows disciplined fundamentals: the needle is grasped consistently on the body about two‑thirds from the tip or at the proximal third depending on angle, oriented near‑perpendicular to the skin surface for orthogonal penetration through the dermis. The non‑driving hand uses Adson forceps to present and evert the wound edges. Throughout, the suture is managed to avoid crossing other unused slits on the pad, with loops laid out away from the line of closure.

Initial access and first stitch at the left end
At the left end of the wound, the left hand brings in the needle driver while the right hand positions the forceps to gently lift and evert the left wound lip. The driver follows the curve of the needle in a controlled wrist‑driven arc to make the first purchase on the near edge, the tip perpendicular to and just a few millimeters from the cut edge. The forceps provide light counter‑traction without crushing the dermis, exposing the intended entry point. The needle is then advanced through the dermal layer and prepared to cross toward the far edge. The suture trail is kept clear, draped laterally across the pad so the working field is not fouled as the first bite is placed.

As this first pass is completed and the suture is drawn through, the non‑driving hand takes over suture management—pulling slack free while maintaining edge approximation—so the driver can be freed for tying. The needle is parked safely and the driver is repurposed as a tying instrument. An instrument tie is then executed directly over the left corner of the wound: the driver opens to accept wraps around the standing limb, the forceps (or the non‑dominant fingers) present the short tail as a target, and the tail is briefly grasped with the driver to bring it through the loop. The first throw is snugged down with gentle downward pressure and slight lateral tension to seat the knot squarely and to begin approximating the left apex.

Consolidating the left‑end knot
With the first throw in place, additional throws are applied to secure the stitch at the left terminus. The driver and forceps maintain a small, controlled working triangle over the left corner. The forceps stabilize the tissue or the short suture end, while the driver alternates the direction of loops to square the knot and prevent slipping. The operator maintains careful control of the short tail, keeping it short and close to the knot to avoid entanglement. The throws are advanced one by one, the knot is settled flush against the epidermal surface, and the initial approximation at the left apex is achieved without crushing the skin. During this tying sequence, the needle remains parked under control near the needle–suture junction to prevent accidental motion, and there is no over‑rotation or palm grip; the thumb–ring‑finger driver grip remains consistent and ergonomic.

Reinforcing the foundation and preparing to proceed
After the leftmost knot is well seated, tying continues briefly to ensure security: in several short episodes, the driver is used as a post, and the operator uses either the forceps or fingertips to form and deliver additional throws. These sequences show proficiency with instrument ties from both sides of the incision: at times the left hand holds the driver and the right hand manages the tail; in other moments, the right hand takes the driver and ties while the left hand steadies tissue or the tail. Despite this alternation, the approach is consistent—square, layered throws, each slid down the post and centered at the left edge. The loop arcs are managed superiorly or laterally to keep the field open. Knot seating is deliberate, with the edges slightly everted around the knot site.

Anchoring and aligning for subsequent bites
At one point early in the process, a securing knot is placed at the pad’s left lower corner, away from the wound. This functions as a simple anchor point to organize suture length and to maintain consistent tension as the operator advances to the incision. Following this, the needle is reloaded in the driver—again at approximately two‑thirds from the tip—and oriented perpendicular to the skin at the left margin of the selected slit. The tip is positioned precisely at the intended entry site, ready for the next pass moving rightward along the same line.

Continuation of interrupted placements along the left third
Moving just rightward from the left apex, the operator resumes a repeatable cadence: present the near edge with forceps, enter perpendicularly at a consistent depth and width from the cut edge, follow the curvature to traverse the dermis, re‑grasp the needle as needed to complete the arc, then take a symmetric bite on the far edge with the forceps briefly lifting the far lip to receive the tip. The suture is drawn through smoothly, slack is removed, and the wound edges are gently coapted without overriding. The driver is then used to tie—instrument throws are formed around the driver, the short tail is grasped and drawn through, and throws are alternated to square and lock the knot centrally over the pass. In some sequences, the tying is done with instrument ties; in others, a two‑handed tie is used, with the strands controlled directly by the fingers. Where scissors are introduced, they approach from the upper‑left to trim suture tails to appropriate length, though several ties are documented without immediate cutting.

Throughout these left‑third passes, the spatial choreography is consistent: the driver and forceps oppose each other across the wound, tips just millimeters from the edge, maintaining a small working triangle centered on the bite site. The suture loop is kept out of the way—either trailed to the operator’s left or looped away superiorly—to prevent tangling. When tying, the driver operates just above the wound line while the forceps are just lateral to the margin, crossing only as needed to deliver a throw.

Progressing across the mid‑portion
As closure advances toward the center, the same pattern repeats. A newly placed stitch is shown just to the right of an earlier knot; the needle driver remains left/superior to the wound axis while the forceps operate right/inferior, lifting each edge to present it to the needle. Bite width and depth are matched across sides, and each pass is perpendicular to the skin to capture robust dermal tissue. After the needle exits, the driver re‑grasps the needle to extract and park it; then the driver is used for instrument ties. Each knot is seated with even tension directed down onto the incision line, and the edges exhibit slight eversion as the knot cinches—just enough to oppose epidermal surfaces without blanching.

In several central sequences, the operator ties directly with both hands, without instruments, indicating comfort with two‑handed knotting. The right hand frequently keeps the standing end taut on the patient’s right side while the left hand manipulates the tail, alternating directions with each throw to square the knot. In other moments, instrument ties are performed with the driver as the post, the left hand or forceps controlling the short end. In every case, the suture line remains clean: loops are slid down carefully, and knot stacks are centered over their respective bites.

Reloading and preparation are efficient throughout the midline work. After each tie, the driver quickly reorients the needle along the same perpendicular axis for the next rightward bite. When a tie is fully completed, the scissors pass through to cut tails, with lengths trimmed neatly; where trimming is not captured in a given sequence, the tails are nonetheless maintained short and controlled to avoid clutter.

Rightward advance and preparation for terminal closure
The right half of the wound is approached with the same orthogonal technique. The driver presents the needle tip to the right wound edge; the forceps grasp the near dermal margin to evert and present a crisp entry point. The needle passes through the near edge at a steady depth, then across to the far side, where the forceps again assist by lifting the far lip for a controlled exit. The suture is drawn through and laid to the operator’s right; slack is removed with steady, coaxial traction to avoid shearing. Edge approximation is assessed visually, ensuring the dermal planes meet evenly.

Knot tying continues to alternate between instrument ties and two‑handed ties, depending on access and preference at that location. When using the instrument tie, the driver and forceps cross above the incision, with the driver superior and the pickups inferior. The short end is posted; the driver rotates to capture the tail through the loop, and the throw is snugged down. As the operator moves further right, the driver sometimes comes from the superior‑right, preparing for a right‑to‑left bite; the left hand with the forceps stays just lateral to the wound, controlling and presenting the tissue. At all times, the driver grip is standard thumb–ring‑finger; there is no palm grip or over‑rotation. When bites are deep enough to require re‑grasping, it is done close to the needle–suture junction for safe extraction.

At a later stage, a new stitch is placed on the right portion of the incision, the edges are approximated with slight eversion at the bite sites, and the stitch is tied. Scissors then cross in from the upper‑left to trim the tails. By this point, several interrupted stitches are visible along the line, each seated flush against the epidermal surface, collectively improving approximation. The suture tails already trimmed lie neatly to either side of each knot.

Hand positioning and spatial relationships across the entire sequence
While instrument roles occasionally switch hands to optimize access, the relative geometry remains consistent:

- During needle passage, the driver is almost always positioned just superior to and slightly lateral to the bite site, oriented perpendicular to the wound. The needle is held on its body no closer than mid‑curve to avoid deforming the needle, and the wrist follows the curvature through the dermis.

- The forceps work opposite the driver, just beyond the edge to be penetrated, exerting minimal force to evert and stabilize the margin. They lift the tissue only enough to present dermis, avoiding any crush injury and avoiding grabbing too much epidermis.

- During tying, a small working triangle is maintained over the bite site. When instrument tying, the driver is the post; the other hand controls and presents the short end, often using pickups for precise control when the tail is very short. Loops are thrown cleanly around the driver, and each throw is seated deliberately to square and lock the knot.

- During two‑handed knotting mid‑line, the right hand often serves as the anchor on the standing end to the patient’s right, with the left hand manipulating the tail on the left. The operator alternates over‑under sequences to ensure a flat, square knot that seats centrally. Tension is applied down and slightly across the incision axis to prevent lateral displacement of the knot.

- Suture management is meticulous: loops arc superiorly away from the field, tails are kept short and controlled near their knots, and the standing limb is maintained as the post during throws. The suture is never allowed to snag adjacent unused slits on the pad.

Technique consistency and evolution
From the first frames to the final moments, the technique remains a series of interrupted skin sutures with careful attention to edge eversion and symmetric bite placement. Early on, more time is spent establishing the foundational left‑end knot with multiple instrument throws, demonstrating the importance placed on a secure anchor at the corner. As the operator progresses, movements become more rhythmic: bite, draw through, tie, and reload—each step executed with consistent ergonomics. At the midline, there is a brief switch to two‑handed knotting, highlighting comfort with alternative tying methods while maintaining knot quality. Later, instrument ties resume and scissors appear to trim tails as closure advances across the right half. The needle is parked safely when tying, and reloaded efficiently when preparing for the next pass. At no point is there undue force or crushing of the tissue; the edges are handled with respect, and eversion is subtle and appropriate.

Occasional shifts in camera angle and pad orientation produce minor variations in how the wound’s location is described (e.g., “lower‑left,” “mid‑lower,” “upper half”), and at one moment an anchor knot is laid at the pad’s corner. Despite these perspective changes, the narrative of work remains continuous on the same straight horizontal slit: previously placed knots are seen adjacent to each new bite, the same suture strand trails into the field from consistent directions, and the progression steadily moves from the left end toward the right.

Final state
By the end of the recorded sequence, several well‑seated interrupted stitches span the wound from the left end through the center, with edges neatly approximated and slightly everted at each knot. At least one right‑side stitch is placed, tied, and trimmed, and the tissue apposition across that segment improves. In the final frames, no hands are visible; the needle and suture are seen near the right portion of the same incision, positioned to engage the remaining open segment. This leaves the line ready for continued closure to the far right, with prior stitches already securing the left and central segments. The field is orderly: knots are centered and flush against the epidermis, tails are trimmed where ties have been completed, and the running supply of suture is controlled and positioned for the next bite. Overall, the closure demonstrates consistent, orthodox interrupted technique with thoughtful instrument handling, secure knot construction, and careful, symmetric edge approximation from left to right along a single incision.
