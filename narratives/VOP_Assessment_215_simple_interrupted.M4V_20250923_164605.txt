COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone training pad with several parallel vertical slits. From the outset the operator commits to a single linear wound and works on it from start to finish, progressively closing it from its lower portion toward the superior end while leaving the adjacent cuts untouched. Across the sequence the handling is deliberate: one hand controls a needle driver and the other handles tissue forceps, the needle is consistently reloaded to preserve a perpendicular entry angle, and each bite is balanced on the two sides of the same wound to maintain eversion and symmetric depth. Tying and trimming punctuate the placement of individual stitches as the closure advances up the line.

The first moments show the initial entry on the chosen slit. With the driver approaching from the operator’s left, its jaws align perpendicular to the incision. The curved needle is gripped on the body about two‑thirds back from the tip—close enough to guide the tip precisely yet far enough to generate torque for a smooth arc. The right hand’s forceps pick up the opposing wound edge lightly, just at the dermal margin, to evert and present a clear bite point. The needle tip is aimed orthogonally across the gap and advanced in a controlled rotation that follows the curvature, establishing a square bite that mirrors on both sides of the cut. The instrument and pickups triangulate across the wound, a few millimeters apart, with the suture trailing freely and managed out of the operative corridor.

Building on that entry, the operator continues with additional passes along the lower-to-mid portion of the same slit. The hands maintain an opposing posture across the wound: driver above or slightly left of the line, forceps stabilizing the far edge. The needle is regripped after each pass to keep its body perpendicular to the skin surface and to ensure the arc remains smooth. The suture is drawn through after each bite and laid to the side to prevent tangling. During this segment the focus is on precise placement and progression rather than knot security; the thread forms loops that are managed purposefully off to the right/lower side.

Shortly after, the first stitch is completed and secured. The forceps present the edge while the driver orchestrates instrument throws over the incision midline. The knot is seated down directly over the wound, approximating the edges without strangulation. Scissors are introduced briefly from the left to trim the tails, which are left short and tidy. Instruments are set aside and then reloaded for the next placement along the same line, with the driver returning to a perpendicular alignment and the forceps resuming their role at the bite site.

The next sequence returns to setup for a subsequent stitch on the same wound. The driver hovers just left of the incision’s centerline while the forceps hold the right wound margin, tips aligned inside the wound to evert the dermis. A new bite is initiated, advancing the needle from one edge toward the other in a consistent depth and distance from the cut edge. The trailing strand is again kept clear of the field, sweeping inferior-left as the bite begins.

A new stitch is then fully placed and tied on the same slit. After the needle traverses both sides, the strand is drawn through and instrument throws are formed in the center of the field. The knot is cinched down to bring the edges together, and scissors are used to trim the tails. The driver remains just superior/left of the incision during tying, while the forceps switch roles as needed to manage the free end or control the tissue. With this stitch secured, the sequence moves up the wound in an orderly fashion.

Midway through, a stitch is being completed on the central portion of the slit. The needle is parked while the free strand is tensioned, then the final throws are set, and scissors appear to cut the tails. Throughout, the adjacent slits visible on the pad remain untouched; all tissue manipulation and knot setting occur on the same line. The forceps continue to approximate and evert the margins as the knot is secured, maintaining edge alignment and preventing inversion.

Advancing superiorly, the next stitch is placed above the prior knots. The left hand retains the driver while the right hand uses pickups to stabilize the right edge. The needle is held near the proximal third of its body, maintaining a perpendicular entry, and the driver repositions to keep the arc stable. The forceps gently lift the dermis on the right, the needle follows through across the gap, and the exit point on the left matches the entry in depth and distance. The suture is drawn through to prepare for tying, keeping tension even and avoiding excessive traction on the tissue.

As the closure progresses, the operator occasionally adjusts hand dominance to optimize angles. In one stretch the right hand holds the needle driver while the left manipulates forceps and the suture tail; this is a pragmatic change in approach angle rather than a change in technique. The needle remains gripped at the proximal third, always presented perpendicular to the skin. The driver advances in a smooth forehand rotation, and the free strand is pulled clear to maintain an unobstructed view of the bite site. The wound edges, already approximated by the inferior stitches, are stabilized without crush as the next pass is set up.

A complete interrupted stitch follows. The driver passes the needle through one side, then the other, at symmetric distances from the cut edge. The thread is pulled through, and multiple instrument throws are tied over the incision to cinch the edges together in line with the existing stitches. The tying sequence is crisp, with each throw seated neatly, and the tails are trimmed short. The driver then returns to the wound with the needle reloaded in preparation for another placement above.

The next segment shows preparation for the following stitch and then a knot being tied on the same midline. The right hand draws the long strand across the incision while the driver forms the throws. Although no new bite is completed within this specific window, the focus is on securing the previously placed pass and setting its knot squarely over the wound. The spacing remains consistent with the earlier closures, and the thread is managed so it lays neatly off to one side between steps.

Continuing upward, the operator initiates a new pass, taking the left-side bite and preparing for the contralateral placement. The driver pronates to advance the needle in a controlled arc, and the forceps gently evert the right edge to align the tissue for a mirror bite. The suture is kept clear of the field, forming a broad arc that does not obstruct visualization. This measured, two‑sided progression maintains even bite sizes and preserves a balanced edge-to-edge approximation.

A set of frames then captures the work just superior to the newly placed knots. The needle is grasped between the proximal third and mid‑shaft to optimize control. Entry is perpendicular, and the operator emphasizes smooth rotation through the tissue on both sides, using the forceps to present and stabilize the dermal margins. Each side is addressed in sequence: the driver places the bite, the needle is retrieved, the driver reloads to maintain a right‑angle approach, and the pass is completed across the wound. The suture is drawn through in preparation for tying the next interrupted stitch.

With several stitches now in place, a previously tied knot is trimmed. Scissors enter from the left, tails are cut to a short length, and the area is cleared. The needle is then reloaded in the driver for the next pass toward the superior end of the same slit. No other incision is engaged, and instrument handling remains tight and deliberate within the small working corridor centered on this wound.

The subsequent frames show another setup for a bite. The driver, positioned slightly left of center, is opposed by the right‑hand forceps, which elevate the right edge to present the dermis and promote eversion. The needle tip is positioned just back from the epidermal margin to achieve full‑thickness purchase without skiving. The pass is made across to a symmetric point on the left. The suture thread is managed above the field, and the orientation of the driver and pickups prevents instrument crowding or crossing.

The technique remains steady as the operator continues placing additional stitches near the upper portion of the wound. After each pass, the suture is drawn through and tensioned just enough to approximate the edges in line with the pattern already established. The needle is repeatedly regripped to maintain a perpendicular approach, and the forceps keep the edges everted and protected during each entry and exit. Hands consistently oppose across the wound, with the driver slightly superior and left, the forceps just right of the margin, and both meeting over the midline for the pass.

At one point the free strand lies along the wound, creating the appearance of a single line tracking up the incision. Despite that appearance, the handling and subsequent behavior remain consistent with individually placed, tied, and cut stitches: the operator lays the strand to one side under light tension to keep it out of the field, then ties and trims as each stitch is completed. Scissors and hemostats rest off to the side and are brought in only when needed.

Near the superior third of the slit, another new pass is placed. The driver holds the needle about two‑thirds from the tip, the curve oriented to traverse the gap cleanly. The right‑hand forceps lift and evert the near edge, then stabilize the opposite edge as the needle exits. The pass is completed, the long strand pulled through toward the operator’s right, and the field is organized for tying. A brief tool change introduces scissors or a clipper with a blue handle, indicating readiness to trim tails once the knot is set.

In the final stretch the driver sets up one more bite near the top of the wound. The same opposing hand positions are maintained: driver just superior and slightly left, forceps just to the right of the margin. The bite is placed and the strand tensioned, bringing the edges together with the same measured approximation seen throughout. Instruments withdraw, leaving the newest stitch aligned with the earlier series, its knot seated over the midline and its tails trimmed appropriately.

Across the entire closure the technique is notably consistent. The needle is always presented perpendicular to the skin surface and advanced by rotating through the tissue on its curve rather than by pushing straight, protecting the needle tip and minimizing tissue trauma. The grasp point on the needle body—typically around the proximal third to two‑thirds from the tip—provides both fine control and sufficient leverage. The driver regrips frequently to preserve optimal orientation for each pass. The forceps are used judiciously on the dermal edge, grasping lightly to evert without crushing, and frequently switching from one side to the other to present the tissue as the needle enters or exits. When tying, the driver forms instrument throws over the wound and seats knots directly atop the incision, maintaining even tension so the edges approximate without ischemia. Tails are trimmed short and consistently.

The spatial relationships remain deliberate and reproducible. The operator works on opposite sides of the slit, with instruments meeting over the incision for each bite and then separating to manage suture and reload the needle. At times the approach is from left‑to‑right, at times from right‑to‑left, determined by the ergonomics of the next bite and camera perspective. The suture is managed so that it arcs away from the active bite site and is laid to one side between steps, avoiding entanglement with instruments or previously placed knots. Scissors enter only when trimming, and when not in use, ancillary tools are placed off to the left, away from the wound.

By the end, the chosen slit is neatly approximated from its lower portion upward toward the superior end. Along its length sit a series of evenly spaced stitches with symmetric entry and exit points and consistent bite depth from the wound edge. The margins are gently everted, and the knots are centered over the midline with short, tidy tails. Neighboring parallel cuts on the pad remain unmanipulated. The final appearance reflects a methodical, stepwise closure executed with careful attention to needle control, edge eversion, and spacing—all carried out on the same incision line from start to finish. Any transient impression of a continuous strand running along the wound is attributable to strand management between ties; the operative flow and repeated tie‑and‑trim sequences confirm a steady progression of individual stitches that bring the wound together in an orderly, aesthetically consistent fashion.
