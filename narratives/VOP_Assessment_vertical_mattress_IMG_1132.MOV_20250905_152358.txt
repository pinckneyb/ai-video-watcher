Pattern: Vertical Mattress

1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes 1/5 inadequate
What I observed were perpendicular, simple interrupted passes rather than the vertical mattress’s far-far followed by near-near sequence and layered geometry. Omission of the two-level pass pattern is a major deficiency for this technique. Score: 1

2. Gentle tissue handling 4/5 proficient
Edges are presented with light, single-purpose grasps of the Adsons, the needle follows its curve with 90-degree entries, and tissue is lifted rather than crushed. Consistently atraumatic handling places this above standard. Score: 4

3. Square, secure knots 4/5 proficient
Instrument ties are executed with alternating throws, reverse wraps to square, occasional double first throws, and precise, midline seating under opposed traction with safe tail trimming. Reproducibly square, well-seated knots merit a high score. Score: 4

4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial 1/5 inadequate
While knots are seated without blanching, there is no demonstrated far-far/near-near layering to show differential tension between deep support and gentle superficial approximation. The vertical mattress–specific balance is not achieved. Score: 1

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm) 2/5 developing
Work centers on individual slits without establishing uniform intervals along a continuous closure or demonstrating standardized spacing. Lack of a consistent interval pattern drops this below standard. Score: 2

6. Proper eversion 3/5 competent
Perpendicular entries and gentle edge presentation create acceptable edge eversion with no inversion, though the eversion ridge is modest. This meets standard but lacks the robust eversion expected from a true vertical mattress. Score: 3

7. Economy of time and motion 4/5 proficient
There is a clean pass–pull-through–reload cadence, purposeful needle parking, tidy suture management with clear long/short limb orientation, and minimal off-field time. Overall flow is efficient and well-organized with only minor, intentional departures. Score: 4

Summative Assessment
Your instrument choreography is disciplined: the right-hand driver maintains perpendicular entries following the arc, the left hand presents and protects edges, and knot sequences are crisp, squared, and centered. Suture management is deliberate, with controlled tails, safe needle parking, and a steady pass–pull–reload rhythm that keeps the field clear and reflects confident, efficient movement.

As a vertical mattress demonstration, it misses the core mechanics: no far-far/near-near sequence, no differential bite depth/width, and no layer-based tensioning to generate durable eversion. To meet standard for this technique, show symmetric far bites at proper distance/depth, then near bites close to the epidermis; set tension with the deep layer and finish with a light superficial approximation; and standardize spacing along a continuous incision. Preserve your atraumatic handling and knot discipline, but explicitly execute and display the vertical mattress geometry and its purpose.
