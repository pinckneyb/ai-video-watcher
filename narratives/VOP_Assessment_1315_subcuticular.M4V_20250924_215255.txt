COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single, continuous repair performed on the long central linear incision of the practice skin pad. From the opening frames through the closing frames the operator repeatedly returns to and advances closure along that central midline wound, adding sequential simple interrupted stitches to close the defect. Throughout the recording the technique and workflow remain focused on precise needle control, edge eversion, and tension management; occasional frames show other short practice slits or a small circular defect on the pad being inspected or manipulated, but these appear as secondary areas or brief instrument adjustments rather than a separate, sustained closure. Where individual frames suggest work on lateral or isolated slits, the dominant, consistent sequence of needle passes, tissue handling, and suture management continues along the central incision.

0.0–14.0 s: The case opens with a horizontal midline incision on the pink synthetic pad already bearing several previously placed interrupted stitches. The operator establishes a familiar two‑instrument rhythm: a long needle driver (held in the left hand for this sequence) approaches from the operator’s left, while right‑handed Adson tissue forceps lift and evert the wound margin. A curved, swaged needle is grasped in the needle holder near the shaft and driven through dermal analog lateral to the wound margin at a shallow entry angle. The non‑dominant forceps provides light traction to evert and stabilize the edge so the needle can take a controlled dermal bite; care is visible to avoid excessive tissue compression. The needle passes in a short arc, the suture is drawn through, and the operator prepares to form a knot—establishing the working pattern that will be repeated along the central line.

15.0–29.0 s: Attention shifts slightly down the pad where another short longitudinal slit is being closed, yet the same technique is used as at the central incision: the needle driver (now held in the left hand) grasps a curved needle mid‑shaft and advances it perpendicular-to-oblique through the tissue while the right Adson forceps elevates and approximates the opposing edge. The operator continues to favor mid‑shaft grips on the needle for torque control, taking short, precise passes through the simulated dermis with slight eversion. Although this shorter slit is addressed here, the approach, instrument choreography, and stitch geometry mirror what will be applied repeatedly along the central incision.

30.0–44.0 s: The camera returns to the midline wound. The left‑hand instrument remains the needle driver while the right hand stabilizes tissue with forceps. The needle is again grasped near the swage‑to‑shaft junction and driven across the wound in a perpendicular arc. Instruments converge over the wound plane and briefly cross, a hallmark of controlled needle transfer and bite depth control. The operator continues to take interrupted, full‑thickness (model‑appropriate) bites with eversion of the edges to promote proper apposition when tied.

45.0–59.0 s: A brief excursion to the left lateral incision appears in these frames, where the operator adopts a similar two‑handed technique but with the right hand performing the needle work and the left hand providing a stabilizing probe. The needle driver grips the curved needle toward mid‑shaft; the tip is oriented toward the near edge and advanced in a curved trajectory consistent with the interrupted stitch. The forceps approximates and everts the edge while the probe gives additional stabilization—again reflecting the same core skill set the surgeon applies to the central closure.

60.0–74.0 s: Back on the central longitudinal incision, a long suture tail is visible and the operator performs careful needle handling and tissue presentation. The right hand holds the needle driver in a near‑perpendicular orientation, the left hand supplies retraction with a long forceps. The driver grasps the needle away from the swage and advances controlled passes through the superficial layers, as existing stitches maintain the deeper approximation. This interval emphasizes refinement: short arcs, precise entry points between prior interrupted stitches, and careful suture management rather than wide or deep bites.

75.0–89.0 s: In the central region the operator shifts hand dominance in some frames—the right hand now frequently holds the needle driver, approaching the wound from above while the left hand holds forceps near the wound edge. The needle is gripped near the shaft, the arc is directed from one margin toward the opposite, and the non‑dominant forceps elevates the edge to create slight eversion. Instrument tips remain only a few centimeters apart, crossing at times above the incision to exchange control and maintain precise alignment between needle passes. The pattern remains simple interrupted sutures placed adjacent to existing ones to close incremental gaps.

90.0–104.0 s and 105.0–119.0 s: These frames show a fresh vertical incision on the left‑central quadrant and a small diagonal/curvilinear defect in the upper left area, but the technique is constant: the operator’s needle driver comes down from above while tissue forceps present the opposite edge from below or lateral. The needle is often grasped approximately two‑thirds toward the tip in these sequences, varying slightly by the bite geometry required at corners and curves. The forceps create a slight eversion and the driver advances the needle in a short controlled rotation to exit the opposite margin. The suture material is pulled through and prepared for knotting—again, the same sequential interrupted approach is used whether the stitch is straight or around a corner.

120.0–134.0 s and 135.0–149.0 s: Working at the lateral end of the main incision and at an oblique left‑sided slit, the operator maintains the same choreography: opposing hands work within a small workspace with tight instrument tip spacing. The left needle driver pivots the curved needle through tissue while the right hand’s forceps holds and lifts the edge to permit full‑thickness but controlled bites. In these frames the grip on the needle alternates between mid‑shaft and nearer the tip depending on the required torque to negotiate curvature and tight angles—demonstrating adaptive needle control while preserving the interrupted stitch geometry.

150.0–164.0 s and 165.0–179.0 s: The operator continues along the long midline defect, attending to the superior lateral aspects where gaps remain between prior stitches. The right hand often holds the needle driver and the left hand the forceps in these passes, emphasizing the flexibility of hand use; regardless, the non‑dominant instrument’s role remains tissue presentation and suture control. Bite depth is controlled, with slight eversion and superficial alignment prioritized. The operator occasionally introduces a small clamp or hemostat to secure a suture tail while continuing placement—an efficient workflow choice that allows continuous progression without losing suture control.

180.0–194.0 s and 195.0–209.0 s: A semicircular defect at the upper‑left quadrant is briefly addressed, and then attention returns to the central line. In the semicircular work the operator’s right driver rotates the needle in a controlled arc while the left instrument provides counter‑traction and governs the free tail. The same pattern of tissue eversion and mid‑shaft control on the needle persists. When back at the central wound, the right hand once again positions the driver vertically to rotate the needle through tissue with the left hand stabilizing—this repetition solidifies the stitch spacing and maintains consistent edge apposition along the evolving line of closure.

210.0–224.0 s and 225.0–239.0 s: Work continues along the central longitudinal wound, focusing on superior–left margins and lateral portions adjacent to the central closure where additional stitches are required. The operator often grasps the needle one‑third to one‑half from the tip in these passes, which allows a forehand pass that seats the needle precisely through both edges. The non‑dominant hand alternates between forceps for direct tissue handling and a hemostat-type clamp to hold suture tails. Instrument trajectories vary from perpendicular entries to more oblique shallow arcs when nearness to prior stitches or triangular tagged areas demands angle adjustment, but the end goal remains the same: interrupted bites with eversion and even spacing.

240.0–254.0 s and 255.0–269.0 s: At times the operator works around a circular/elliptical defect at the pad’s top‑left, using the same interrupted stitch technique tailored to curved margins. The right‑hand needle driver passes the curved needle shallowly and tangentially where appropriate, while the left hand retrieves and controls suture length. Returning to the central midline, the operator adds another stitch at the superior end, again grasping the needle mid‑shaft for controlled torque and applying counter‑traction with the forceps. Throughout these intervals, instrument crossing remains minimal and purposeful—aimed at controlling bite depth and preventing over‑inversion.

270.0–284.0 s and 285.0–299.0 s: As the sequence progresses, suture management becomes more visible: hemostats are occasionally applied to secure tails, and the hands manage tension and suture routing between passes. The left hand frequently holds the needle driver while the right manipulates suture tails and adjusts the pad; sometimes no active needle penetration is visible as the operator prepares for knot tying or trims suture ends. When needle passes do occur, they consistently follow the simple interrupted pattern—short controlled arcs, edge presentation with forceps, and suture seating through superficial-to-full‑thickness model layers.

300.0–314.0 s: The central section of the incision receives further attention. The right hand primarily holds the needle and the left handles the forceps; suture loops are pulled through and routed for knot formation. The operator’s motions show an economy of movement: precise passes, prompt transfer of the free tail to a clamp when continuing to the next stitch, and repeated eversion to ensure the epidermal edges will come together correctly once knots are completed.

315.0–328.0 s (final segment): The sequence closes with the superior‑central portion being finalized. Hands remain close—typically 2–4 cm apart—operating in a coordinated cross‑pattern as the needle is withdrawn, suture tails are tensioned, and the final passes are seated. The right‑hand forceps stabilizes the epidermal margin while the left‑hand hemostat manages the free strand; the operator draws the last loops through and arranges the suture material for knotting or trimming. Across these last frames the central linear wound presents an orderly row of simple interrupted sutures: evenly spaced, producing slight eversion of the edges, and consistently approximating dermal layers without undue inversion or gapping.

Technique consistency and development
From start to finish the operator maintains a consistent interrupted suturing technique adapted to local geometry. Needle grips vary subtly—mid‑shaft for standard arcs, slightly nearer the tip when passage around corners or through tight curvature is required—but the motion pattern remains the same: present the near edge with forceps to achieve slight eversion, take a controlled curved bite through the opposite side with the needle driver, draw the suture through, secure the tail (often temporarily with a hemostat), and move to the adjacent gap. Hand dominance shifts depending on the angle and access, but the roles are preserved: the needle‑controlling hand drives the needle and the other hand presents and stabilizes tissue and managing suture material. As the procedure progresses the operator demonstrates improved economy and cadence—rapid but deliberate needle passes, immediate management of suture tails, and efficient transitions between bites—indicating an evolving fluency in instrument exchange and suture management.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Early frames show the needle driver approaching from a lateral aspect with the forceps over the wound; mid‑procedure there is more frequent crossing of instruments above the incision as the operator refines bite depth and angle. Proximity is consistently tight: tips are routinely within 1–4 cm of each other, enabling controlled needle transfer and precise edge alignment. The operator uses vertical/overhead approaches when a perpendicular bite is desired and lateral/oblique approaches when the wound geometry or prior stitches constrain the angle. Hemostats and clamps are intermittently introduced to secure tails and free hands to place additional stitches without losing control of previously placed suture material.

Final state
By the end of the recording the central incision is uniformly approximated with an orderly line of simple interrupted sutures. Edges are slightly everted—an intended outcome to promote epidermal edge apposition—and suture loops and tails are managed in a systematic way, with some tails clamped or gathered as the operator prepares for final knotting and trimming. Throughout the sequence there is clear attention to atraumatic handling, consistent bite depth relative to the model’s layers, and even spacing between stitches. The closure appears functionally complete in that sequential bites have been placed to close the entire length of the central defect; if any final knot‑tying or trimming remains unseen in the frames, it is only because the video emphasizes stitch placement and suture control rather than prolonged knot demonstration. Overall, the procedure exhibits disciplined, repeated application of the simple interrupted technique: precise needle control, deliberate edge eversion, careful suture management, and a steady progression of interrupted stitches producing a neat, well‑approximated linear closure.
