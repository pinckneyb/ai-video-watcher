COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone practice pad bearing three parallel vertical incisions. From early on it becomes clear the operator selects the right-side wound as the line to close and then remains dedicated to that same wound throughout, progressing from its inferior end upward. The other two slits to the left are only ever seen in the periphery and remain untouched.

Initial setup and orientation take place before any tissue is engaged. At the outset, a right hand occasionally hovers over the field with a driver-like instrument while the left hand passes above the pad; no needle is yet loaded and there is no contact with skin edges. Instruments are positioned and the suture is prepared, including brief handling through an eyelet at the pad’s corner as part of setup. Once ready, the operator brings full attention to the rightmost vertical incision near the lower-right corner, and the rest of the sequence centers on this single wound.

The closure begins at the inferior end of the right incision. The left hand takes the needle driver while the right hand takes fine tissue forceps. The needle is consistently seated in the driver at roughly the proximal third to mid-body, and it is presented perpendicular to the pad with the curvature aligned to allow a controlled arcing pass across the gap. The right-hand forceps provide traction and edge control on the right side of the slit, gently everting the epidermal-dermal margin to present an ideal entry point and to protect tissue from unnecessary crush. The needle advances in a smooth wrist-driven arc through the near edge and across toward the far edge. The driver regrips the needle after partial passage as needed to complete the retrieval, and the strand is drawn through leaving an appropriate tag.

With that first passage completed at the very bottom of the wound, the operator establishes the anchor. Over the first minute of work at this end, the right hand alternates between controlling the suture and using forceps, while the left hand uses the driver as a post to form instrument loops. Throws are formed and seated down to the entry site, securing the starting point. The free end at the tail is trimmed to a concise tag to prevent entanglement, and the driver is briefly used to pull the needle and strand through to prepare for subsequent advancement. The movements remain confined to the inferior few millimeters of the right-side wound, with the instruments straddling the incision and remaining parallel to its axis to maintain a tidy working corridor.

Once anchored, the technique transitions to rhythmic advancement along the same slit. The needle is reloaded at two-thirds from the tip for reliable control with each bite, and the right-hand forceps re-engage the wound margin. Each bite is planned with an emphasis on perpendicular approach to the skin surface and symmetric purchase on both sides. The forceps lift and evert the presented edge—first the near edge for entry, then the opposite edge to guide exit—while the driver delivers the needle across the gap. After passage, the driver or forceps regrasp the needle to pull it through, keeping the suture under gentle, controlled tension. At the inferior end, the early passes are also accompanied by careful instrument-loop maneuvers to secure the line and manage tension, ensuring the anchor holds and the early segment remains snug. When slack accumulates, the operator pauses to draw the strand through and keeps it clear of the field, preventing loops from catching on adjacent knots or the pad.

As bites continue just above the initial knot cluster, the hands maintain a predictable choreography. The left hand with the driver approaches from the left/superior side, hovering centrally over the incision; the right hand with forceps remains just lateral to the wound. For each next pass, the driver positions the needle tip perpendicular to the skin, advances across in a controlled arc, and regrips for smooth retrieval. The forceps alternate sides to lift the everted margin and to receive the needle tip as needed. After each pass, the suture is drawn through and tensioned with just enough traction to approximate the edges and maintain mild eversion.

Intermittent moments of housekeeping occur as the line lengthens. When segments of the strand or small tags sit too close to the surface, the left hand briefly sets down the driver and picks up scissors. The scissor tips approach from above-left and trim immediately adjacent to knots or locking points, with the driver or forceps stabilizing the strand to prevent inadvertent tugging on the closure. The needle is occasionally “parked” in the driver while trimming is performed, always kept clear of the tissue. These brief interludes focus on tidiness and tension balance in the segment already completed at the lower-to-mid portion of the wound, and they happen without engaging the other incisions.

Progress marches steadily upward along the right slit. Through the middle third, the operator keeps bites shallow to moderate and symmetric, reloading the needle after each arc to preserve the perpendicular orientation. Forceps handling is meticulous—lifting the epidermal-dermal edge without crushing, then switching sides to receive and guide the exit of the needle. The line of stitches begins to span the lower and mid segments with consistent spacing and even tension. When a completed section shows long tails from earlier securing steps, scissors are introduced from the upper-left and tails are trimmed flush, again with the needle driver holding or moving strands aside to protect the suture line. The needle is not driven while trimming is ongoing; it is consciously kept out of tissue and often oriented obliquely or perpendicular to the pad while “parked.”

As the closure nears the upper half of the slit, the technique remains consistent: precise perpendicular entries, symmetric exit, and immediate pull-through to seat each pass. The right hand maintains fine control of the near and far margins to everting effect, and the left hand advances the needle in controlled arcs. The suture management is deliberate—free strands are lifted clear of the field when the driver is in use, and tension is adjusted to avoid strangulation or step-offs. Occasionally, the operator pauses to regrasp the needle closer to the tip for a precise exit, particularly when working close to previously placed passes or knots.

There are brief periods where the wound appears at a slight oblique angle rather than perfectly vertical—a perspective change likely due to pad or camera orientation—but despite the apparent change in angle, the operator continues seamlessly along the same right-side incision. The pattern and location remain constant: the same wound on the right edge of the pad, its edges increasingly approximated with a contiguous line of passes running from the lower end toward the upper end. At times, the right hand uses an auxiliary instrument to manage the free suture while the needle is drawn through, keeping loops from tangling; at other times, the left hand uses scissors to tidy up any excess tag at the recently secured portion before moving on.

Near the top of the mid segment, hands and instruments periodically trade roles for brief tasks. The right hand may momentarily hold the driver while the left uses scissors or takes the forceps to regrip the needle, but the general pattern remains: the driver leads the pass, and the forceps present and protect tissue. The operator also uses the driver as a post for controlled tightening in certain steps, seating the strand gently down to the surface and maintaining neat approximation along the line. Even when scissors are introduced, the priority remains edge control and tension balance; trims occur a few millimeters from the knots or locking turns, always with the driver or forceps stabilizing the area.

As the stitch line approaches the superior third, multiple passes are added in close sequence. Each time, the driver is held just lateral to the wound, then crosses over the slit in a smooth arc to the far side, with the right-hand forceps on the opposing edge guiding the exit. The strand is then pulled through and tensioned. Between bites, the needle is reloaded at about two-thirds from its tip, ensuring the curvature is oriented for another perpendicular entry. The operator is careful to keep the strand clear of all prior passes, repeatedly regrasping either the needle or the suture to avoid snags and to preserve a straight, neat line.

Throughout this phase, the central and left incisions remain untouched; all activity is localized to the right-side slit. The wound edges show mild, consistent eversion along the completed segment, and the approximation remains uniform with no gapping. When necessary, scissors reappear to snip any residual tails from earlier securing maneuvers, with the needle held idle in the driver until trimming is complete. Regripping resumes, and the line advances another few millimeters toward the top.

At the superior end of the wound, the last small gap is closed with one more carefully planned bite. The left hand holds the driver over the apex; the right-hand forceps evert the near edge and then the far as the driver guides the needle across with a final controlled arc. The strand is pulled through, and the edges at the very top are gently snugged to match the coaptation below. With the body of the wound fully approximated, attention shifts to securing and finishing the line. The forceps briefly take the suture to maintain tension while the driver manages the needle and positions the strand for final locking and tie-off.

Finishing is executed just above the last pass at the superior corner. The driver or forceps alternately hold tension on the standing end while the other hand forms the locking steps and final securing throws. The needle is disengaged from the field and parked while the final knot is seated flush to the wound surface. The movements here mimic the earlier anchor work—controlled loops formed around a post, deliberate seating of each throw, and careful protection of the freshly approximated edges—only this time at the superior apex rather than the inferior end. With the terminal knot secured, scissors are introduced from the left/superior side to trim the tail. Cuts are made close to the knot without nicking adjacent strands, and any remaining slack is gently drawn out to leave a clean finish.

A brief pause confirms completion. In the final view, no instruments are engaged at the wound. The right-most vertical incision is now spanned by a continuous line of closely spaced, symmetric cutaneous bites from the inferior corner up to the superior apex, with mild eversion and uniform tension throughout. The lower anchor at the start and the upper tie-off are neatly trimmed, leaving short tags that do not interfere with the closure. The entire trajectory of work has been confined to this single wound: repeated, controlled needle passages in a consistent orientation; precise forceps eversion for entry and exit; intermittent strand management to maintain a clear field; and brief, purposeful scissor use to trim tags at the start, along the line where needed, and at the final tie-off. The other two incisions—the central and left slits—remain unaddressed and unchanged from the beginning.

Of note, there are isolated moments where tool actions might be mistaken for cutting of intermediate “stitches” midline or where the wound’s axis appears diagonal rather than vertical. In context, those sequences represent routine housekeeping of the same continuous closure—trimming tags or managing the strand during progression—and perspective shifts from camera or pad orientation. The technique remains consistent from start to finish: beginning with a secured anchor at the inferior end, advancing with a series of controlled, perpendicular passes that approximate the skin edges along one uninterrupted path, and concluding with a deliberate terminal tie and trim at the superior end.

Hand position and role remain largely consistent and deliberate across the procedure. The left hand predominantly operates the needle driver, keeping the needle grasped at roughly two-thirds from the tip to preserve a stable arc and perpendicular entry. The right hand manages the tissue with toothed forceps, everting margins to present targets for entry and exit, then briefly exchanging tools to handle scissors or to stabilize the suture during tensioning and tying. When trimming is required, the left hand introduces scissors from above-left, while the right hand stabilizes strands or tissue; when passing the needle, the left hand leads the arc and the right hand protects and presents tissue. Instruments approach the wound in parallel, straddling the slit with short working distances to preserve control and precision.

By the end, the right-sided wound is neatly closed from bottom to top with evenly spaced passes and a tidy finish at the apex. The line exhibits gentle eversion, no obvious gapping, and cleanly cut tails at both the initial anchor and the terminal tie. The needle is withdrawn from the field, and activity ceases, leaving the completed closure intact. The central and left incisions remain untouched throughout, underscoring that only one incision line was selected and closed in this session.
