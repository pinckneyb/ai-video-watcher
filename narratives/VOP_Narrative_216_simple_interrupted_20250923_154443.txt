COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel vertical practice cuts, but the work consistently progresses on the central vertical incision. The neighboring left and right slits remain present in the field as references and occasional resting points for instruments, yet they are not developed into closures. Early in the recording the view is briefly suboptimal while a paper label partly obscures a horizontal line on the pad; no active needle handling occurs during this opening pause. From that point onward the operator concentrates on the short midline vertical incision, beginning low on the wound and advancing upward, ultimately converting early anchoring into a continuous closure and finishing with a secure terminal knot at the superior end. A few short interludes show tying technique demonstrated over other small cuts, but these do not advance those wounds; the closure that is actually built and completed is the midline vertical line.

Initial anchoring and first passes on the midline begin with classic two‑handed technique. The left hand controls a needle driver; the right hand uses Adson forceps to present the edges. The needle is consistently grasped on its body about one-third to two-thirds from the tip and oriented roughly perpendicular to the skin, allowing it to follow its curvature cleanly. The first visible pass is a forehand motion from the left edge of the central slit across to the right. The forceps alternate between lifting the near lip and then receiving the needle at the far lip, producing symmetric entry and exit a few millimeters from the edge with even depth. Once the suture is drawn through, the driver transitions into tying mode while the right hand manages the free limb, forming and cinching throws directly over the wound. These early throws are laid with instrument ties: the driver passes through the loop, grasps the tail, and the right hand tensions the long limb laterally to square and seat the knot without twisting the edges. The wound approximates with slight eversion as the throws are snugged down.

This establish‑and‑tie rhythm repeats across the midline wound’s lower segment. The driver remains central or slightly left of center; the right hand alternates between forceps and free-hand control of the suture tail. The needle is often parked while tying—kept safely away from the tissue on the right side—then reloaded with the tip perpendicular to the incision in preparation for the next bite. Across these early sequences the edges are brought together methodically. Throws are seated flat; tension is balanced across both limbs to avoid strangulation of the synthetic dermis, and the knot stacks sit directly over the incision line.

There are brief moments where the camera captures knot‑tying demonstrations over other cuts—a small transverse puncture and the left vertical slit show isolated throws being seated without further passage. These detours do not progress those wounds into closures; they function more like practice of instrument ties and tension control. Forceps sometimes lift a wound edge during these interludes, but no continuous sequence is carried forward there. Throughout, the instruments consistently return to and remain centered over the short midline vertical incision for the actual closure.

Back on the midline wound, the operator alternates between placing a new bite and tying it down. Forceps are used sparingly early on, then more purposefully as the work advances superiorly to ensure eversion and to standardize bite depth. The needle is always reloaded with attention to geometry—held at the proximal to middle third, wrist-driven to arc through the near dermis, and then across to the far edge at a matching level—maintaining good alignment and spacing. After each pass, the right hand tensions the standing portion to draw the loop snugly, the knot is cinched with instrument ties, and the needle is again parked to avoid accidental injury during tying. At one point scissors enter to trim a tail once a knot is secured; this keeps the field tidy as the closure marches upward.

As the closure enters the mid-to-upper segment of the midline incision, the technique consolidates into a smooth, continuous sequence. The right hand increasingly manages the suture as a running line to maintain tension and edge approximation while the left hand, with the driver, places the next pass. Bites continue to be symmetric, a few millimeters from the wound edge with consistent depth, eversion aided by gentle pickup of the dermal edge with forceps on the opposing side. After each pass, the operator draws the suture through and seats the loop against the preceding one, sometimes employing a locking movement that lays the loop down snugly to the previous throw. When locking maneuvers are used, the loops lie along the incision, and the right hand applies counter‑traction on the standing end to hold the prior segment while the next bite is taken, preserving uniform spacing.

Hand positioning evolves with the line’s progression. Early, the left hand often hovers just left/superior to the stitch site while the right hand crosses the wound to deliver and tension throws. Later, as bites are placed one after another, the driver is centered directly over the top of the prior stitch and advances from left to right or right to left depending on the angle that best presents the next purchase. The forceps, when used, oppose the driver just lateral to the opposite edge, lightly grasping the margin to evert the dermis at the intended entry/exit point. The needle orientation remains consistent—nearly perpendicular to the skin—permitting controlled arcs with minimal drag. The suture is managed to avoid fouling: the tail and excess are kept laterally and cephalad, and loops are drawn down in a straight path along the incision axis.

In the superior half of the wound, the continuous cadence is clear. The operator takes a bite, draws the suture through while the right hand maintains traction on the standing limb, and then secures the segment—either by locking the loop against the prior throw or by promptly placing the next pass under maintained tension. The wound edges remain well approximated without gapping, with a subtle, uniform eversion. The driver occasionally pauses after a pass to act as a post for a tensioning maneuver; then the needle is regrasped correctly on its body to continue. When regrasping, the jaws are placed at the proximal-to-middle third of the curve to preserve the needle’s structural integrity and to maintain control for the subsequent entry.

Approaching the apex of the incision, the field tightens and the operator’s movements are small and precise. The needle driver and forceps work within a few millimeters of one another at the topmost stitches. The free strand emerges near the superior end of the line, where the final passes are placed and the terminal configuration is created. The driver sometimes holds the needle parked while the right hand alternates traction on the standing and free ends to cinch down the line, then the driver reengages to pass through loops for finishing throws. At this stage there are no new penetrations through tissue in several sequences; the work is entirely devoted to securing and locking the end of the continuous suture. The forceps briefly steady the delicate apex as needed, but most of the termination relies on precise instrument ties with the driver and careful strand management by the right hand.

There is a brief moment at the superior end when a strand is trimmed after securing a segment; immediately after, additional finishing motions are undertaken to add another pass at the very top to optimize edge alignment. This reflects an attentive finish rather than a second, separate closure: the instruments remain centered at the apex, the needle is reloaded with perpendicular orientation, and a final symmetric bite is taken to complete the coaptation exactly at the top. With the apex flush and everted, the operator transitions into the true terminal knot. The left hand with the needle driver and the right hand with the free suture limb work in opposition; loops are formed over the driver tips, the tail is grasped, and sequential throws are seated with alternating direction to lock the termination. Throughout these throws the needle is held out of the tissue path, parked safely yet ready if a minor adjustment is desired. The vector of tension remains across the wound axis, preventing the knot from dragging to either side. The terminal knot sits immediately over the final stitch, flat and secure.

Over the last several frames, additional locking throws are laid to ensure security of the terminal knot. The right hand alternates traction between the standing and free ends to square the knot stack without twisting it, while the driver passes through and retrieves the tail for each throw. The suture line remains continuous and intact; no new bites are placed during these finishing maneuvers. Once satisfied with the integrity of the termination, the instruments withdraw. A brief pause follows with hands off the field, confirming cessation of active manipulation.

Throughout the case, spatial relationships and instrument handling remain consistent and disciplined:

- The needle is always grasped at the correct point on the body—never at the tip—protecting its curvature and facilitating precise, wrist-driven arcs perpendicular to the skin.
- The driver and forceps oppose one another across the incision for each pass, with the driver on the side of entry and the forceps presenting or receiving the edge on the far side. When not actively taking a bite, the driver is used deftly as a tying instrument.
- The suture is managed thoughtfully: the standing limb is kept aligned with the incision, loops are controlled to avoid crossing or strangling the tissue, and excess strand is swept laterally/cephalad to maintain an uncluttered field.
- Forceps use is gentle and targeted, just enough to evert and stabilize the dermal edge without crushing; at times the operator forgoes forceps during tying, relying solely on strand tension to maintain approximation.
- Scissors enter only to trim a secured tail; they otherwise remain off to the right, avoiding unnecessary presence in the field.

A few minor deficiencies are noted but do not detract from the overall progression: the very first moments are partially obscured by a label, limiting visualization of the wound; and at scattered times there are brief demonstrations of tie‑downs over other cuts (including the left vertical and a short transverse incision) that neither develop into closures nor disrupt the continuous advance of the main midline repair. These off-axis moments are short and return promptly to the central wound, which remains the sole incision that is systematically closed from bottom to top.

By the end, the central vertical incision is fully coapted along its length with a continuous series of evenly spaced, symmetric bites showing slight, consistent eversion. The superior apex is neatly finished with a compact terminal knot secured by multiple alternating throws. The suture line lies straight along the wound axis without dog-ears or gaps; tension appears uniform with no excessive blanching of the synthetic skin. Lateral practice cuts remain untouched, and the field is tidy with trimmed tails and instruments withdrawn. The closure demonstrates a coherent evolution from initial anchoring and early tie control into a confident, efficient continuous technique, applied with stable hand positioning and careful respect for tissue mechanics, and completed with a secure, deliberate termination at the wound’s apex.
