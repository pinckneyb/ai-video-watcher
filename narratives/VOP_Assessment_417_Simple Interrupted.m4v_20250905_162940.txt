Pattern: Simple Interrupted

1. Perpendicular needle passes: The needle was oriented orthogonally and driven along its curve through both edges with clean entry and exit, minimizing shear. This meets standard for perpendicular passage without clear evidence of multiple, symmetric repetitions along a full line. 3/5 competent

2. Gentle tissue handling: Edges were stabilized with light, single grasps and much of the approximation was achieved by balanced horizontal tension rather than repeated forceps manipulation. This reflects delicate handling with minimal crush risk, exceeding standard. 4/5 proficient

3. Square, secure knots: Throws alternated direction, were advanced down a post, and seated flat and centered with consistent horizontal tension; tails were trimmed only after securing. The knots are square and secure throughout, reflecting strong fundamentals. 4/5 proficient

4. Appropriate approximation/tension: Edges were brought together with balanced lateral tension so they just met without visible blanching, puckering, or gaps. Tension control appears appropriate and reproducible in the stitches shown. 3/5 competent

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm): The short run appears neat but spacing was not deliberately standardized to a consistent 0.5–1.0 cm interval. Lack of a clear, repeatable pattern keeps this below standard. 2/5 developing

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable): The near edge was gently everted during placement and horizontal tension during tying maintained a flat-to-slightly everted profile with no inversion. Eversion control is consistent and exceeds basic adequacy. 4/5 proficient

7. Economy of time and motion: Hands worked in small, efficient arcs near the field with safe needle parking, purposeful instrument changes, and minimal instrument crossing. Motion was economical with little wasted movement, reflecting efficient flow. 4/5 proficient

Summative assessment:
Your flow is deliberate and efficient: wrap, grasp, slide, set—repeated with consistent control and horizontal tensioning that avoids edge distortion. Instrument management is disciplined with safe needle parking, a reliable post to guide throws, and compact hand movements that stay close to the work, conveying confidence and control.

To raise this to a teaching-grade performance, standardize the mechanics of bite planning and spacing—commit to consistent bite width, depth, and inter-suture intervals across the line, and intentionally demonstrate symmetric, perpendicular bites repeatedly. Avoid clamping suture with a hemostat as a post to prevent material damage; use the driver or a controlled opposing limb instead, and consider keeping the needle secured in the driver or a needle pad rather than free on the field. Finish each knot with a defined throw sequence appropriate to the material and maintain the same efficient cadence through full closure to demonstrate reproducibility.
