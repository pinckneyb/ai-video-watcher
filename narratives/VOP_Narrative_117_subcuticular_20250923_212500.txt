COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on a single, straight vertical laceration located just to the right of center on the skin pad. From first entry to final inspection, all instrument work, needle handling, and suture management remain dedicated to this one wound. Other slits on the pad are never engaged; the surgeon’s focus and instrument traffic stay centered on this right‑of‑midline cut, building a contiguous line of closure along its length in the selected technique.

The opening moments show the first pass being established. With forceps lifting the right wound edge to evert the dermis, a needle driver held in the opposite hand seats the curved needle at a perpendicular angle. The needle is grasped about a third of the way from the swage and advanced in a controlled, wrist‑driven arc through the tissue. The entry point sits a few millimeters off the epidermal–dermal junction, and the trajectory crosses toward the opposite edge, respecting the needle’s curvature. Handling is gentle and precise: the far edge is stabilized, the near edge is not crushed, and the suture follows the curve smoothly through the dermal layer. The strand is drawn across the gap, leaving an appropriate length on the far side for tying.

Immediately after that first pass, attention turns to securing the stitch. The right hand alternates between a needle driver and forceps while the left hand controls the long free strand. The movements are those of instrument tying: loops are formed over the incision, the driver reaches through and grasps the free end, and the throw is laid down squarely over the center of the wound. Tension is applied in a straight line along the axis of the slit, drawing the edges together without shearing or twisting. In these early ties, the operator maintains clear working space on either side of the wound; the driver and assisting instrument approach from opposite sides, crossing just over the incision to capture the loop. With the stitch secured, the line has its foundational anchor, and the needle is reloaded for continuation.

With the initial stitch in place, the surgeon begins advancing the closure. The needle holder, now predominantly in the right hand, returns to a perpendicular posture over the same slit, while the left hand picks up Adson forceps to elevate the far dermal edge. A new bite is taken, again at an even distance from the wound edge, following the needle’s curve through the tissue. The forceps lightly grasp just the dermal margin to encourage eversion; they may briefly assist in retrieving the needle tip as it emerges. The suture is pulled through in a smooth motion, and the needle is regripped on its proximal third to complete the arc and prepare for the next pass. The surgeon maintains a small working triangle: the driver on one side, forceps on the other, and the wound at the apex. Suture tails are organized to the patient’s right and slightly superior, kept out of the operative plane to prevent tangles.

Securing continues in cadence with placement. The driver, held low and close to the skin, forms loops while the assisting hand reaches across to seize and deliver the free end. Throws are seated with measured tension so that the approximated edges lie flat with gentle eversion. During these tying sequences, tissue is not re‑grasped; instead, the surgeon relies on the previously placed pass to maintain opposition while the knot is laid down. The driver and assistant hands alternate crossing above the incision, ensuring that each throw is faithful to the plane of the wound and that knot stacks sit neatly over the midline rather than slipping laterally.

A similar pattern repeats as the closure progresses superiorly. After a knot is set, the needle is reloaded with careful attention to orientation—grasped two‑thirds from the tip for reliable control and held perpendicular to the skin surface. The next bite begins with the far edge tented upward by the forceps to present the dermis. The needle follows a tight, rotational path through the tissue, emerging on the near side at a matched depth and offset, creating symmetric entry and exit points. The suture is drawn through deliberately, and the free end is managed superiorly or laterally to keep the field clear. At times, the left hand takes over the driver for a series of throws, while the right hand manages the short end with forceps; at other times, the right hand retains the driver and the left hand becomes the assistant. These shifts in hand dominance do not change the wound being addressed, the direction of progress, or the technique itself; they represent ergonomic adjustments that still respect the same closure plan.

As the work moves toward the upper half of the incision, the frames show the surgeon alternating seamlessly between placement and tying. An instrument tie secures a recent pass; the knot stacks neatly and the suture line lies in register with prior stitches. The surgeon then reloads the needle for the next bite, commonly orienting the arc across the gap from left to right or right to left depending on instrument setup and access. Each pass is placed only a few millimeters apart, maintaining consistent spacing and depth so that no segment gaps or bunches. Forceps contact is light, aimed at dermal purchase and eversion rather than crushing or broad grasping.

In one sequence near the upper third, the left hand operates the needle driver while the right hand, holding fine tissue forceps, lifts the right wound lip. The needle is driven through that right edge with the correct perpendicular approach and regrasped to complete its path. The suture is pulled through and the instruments briefly withdraw superiorly to manage the loop before the next throw is laid down. In another sequence just above this, the right hand resumes control of the driver, and the left hand’s forceps stabilize the opposite edge while a new bite is taken in line with the previous stitch. The arc of the needle is preserved, digs only as deeply as necessary for dermal purchase, and exits with a predictable trajectory that brings the needle tip up in the surgeon’s visual field for regrasping. The continuity of movement and the spatial consistency are notable: instruments always straddle the laceration, with the driver crossing the incision when driving the needle and the forceps remaining just adjacent to the entry or exit site to guide, retrieve, or control the tissue.

Knotting sequences intersperse these placements regularly. In these moments, needle passes pause, and the driver stays just off the surface to form and deliver loops. The assistant hand manages the free limb, alternately tightening and relaxing to seat each throw. The loops are drawn down directly over the wound line, and the edges are visually assessed as the knot cinches. The surgeon avoids pulling the knot off to one side; instead, it is central, snug, and stacked. At times, especially while tying at the superior end, the needle remains clamped in the driver during loop handling, a common efficiency when moving quickly between placement and tie. After the knot is secured, the needle is repositioned just superior to the last stitch, indicating readiness for the next pass without crossing into other incisions.

As the line extends further cranially, successive frames show continued attention to symmetry and tension. Fresh bites are taken immediately superior to prior stitches, and the strand is drawn through in a fluid motion. The surgeon’s hands oppose each other—forceps on one side, driver on the other—maintaining parallelism with the wound edges to avoid skewing. The sequence emphasizes small, even intervals matching the earlier spacing, with each stitch approximating the wound edges while preserving slight eversion. The suture is managed superiorly so that it does not obscure the bite site, and the free tail from recent knots is often directed rightward or cranially to prevent snagging on the needle.

The technique remains consistent, even as the surgeon changes which hand holds which tool. At times, the driver is in the left hand, approaching from the left toward the right; in other moments, it is carried in the right hand and crosses from right to left. Regardless, the needle is nearly always grasped at its proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the skin; wrist rotation follows the curvature for tissue passage; and regrasping occurs at predictable points to complete the arc cleanly. Forceps support toggles between the far and near edges depending on the direction of travel, but the purpose remains the same: evert and stabilize, then retrieve the needle tip with minimal trauma.

Midway through the upper half of the incision, several short sequences highlight loop and knot management without new tissue penetration. The driver forms a loop, the assistant instrument or hand captures the short limb, and the throw is advanced down onto the previous stitch. These non‑penetrating sequences underscore the methodical cadence of the closure: bite, draw through, tie; then repeat, marching up the wound in orderly fashion. The surgeon’s working triangle narrows toward the top as space gets tighter, but spacing and alignment remain disciplined.

Higher up, the needle is again loaded and driven through one edge, regrasped, and then steered across the gap into the opposite edge, maintaining the same bite width and depth as previous stitches. The suture is drawn through smoothly with controlled tension to eliminate slack without strangling tissue. A new knot is then formed over the top of the newest stitch. The right hand often assumes tensioning duties while the left hand’s driver lays the throws, and then roles reverse as necessary for subsequent steps. Throughout, the suture tail is placed superiorly and to the right to keep the operative path clear for the next pass.

Approaching the superior end of the wound, the surgeon continues the pattern. Another bite is taken, slightly superior to the last, guided by forceps that gently tent the edge for eversion. The needle is reloaded each time to maintain perpendicular entry, with minute adjustments of the driver angle ensuring that entry and exit on both sides match. Even as the field becomes crowded with previously placed knots and short tails, the surgeon maintains a habit of lifting loops up and then seating them straight down, preventing any inadvertent crossing or entrapment of tissue.

In the final tying sequences at the upper third and near the apex of the slit, the driver manipulates the suture loop while the assistant hand controls the short limb to set tension. One sequence shows the surgeon cinching down the most recent stitch over the superior portion of the line, then repositioning the needle just beyond, as if preparing for another pass; nevertheless, within the observed frames, no additional penetration is made. The emphasis here is on securing the existing work and preparing the closure’s top end to a finished state. The loop is tightened to lie flush against the prior stitches, and the suture holds the edges in crisp apposition.

The final moments are devoted to inspection and refinement rather than placement. With the needle attached to the standing end and kept out of the tissue, scissors approach from the top-left toward the superior end of the line. The operator checks the integrity of the last knot stack and trims a tail or tag as appropriate. No driver engages the needle, and no new passes are made. Instead, the clinician’s fingertips gently run along the right‑side wound, pressing and smoothing the skin edges to judge approximation, tension, and evenness. There is no additional eversion with forceps; rather, the assessment relies on visual alignment and tactile feedback. The scissors then withdraw, leaving the superior end tidy. Throughout this inspection, all action remains confined to the same vertical wound; there is no excursion to adjacent incisions.

Across the entire sequence, the selected technique is maintained consistently. Bites are small and symmetric, the needle remains perpendicular to the skin surface with rotation matching its curvature, and forceps are used lightly to evert rather than crush. Knotting occurs in a regular cadence between placements, with throws laid down directly over the incision and tension corrected to avoid strangulation or gapping. When a frame sequence focuses purely on loop handling or knot seating without forceps‑assisted eversion, this reflects normal intra‑tie ergonomics rather than a departure from the technique. Hand dominance alternates at times—left hand on the driver for a series of throws or passes, then right hand reassuming driver control—but these shifts serve access and visibility while still advancing the same wound in a single, uninterrupted line.

By the end, the right‑of‑center vertical laceration is approximated along its upper and middle segments with a continuous series of evenly spaced stitches placed and tied in sequence. The knots are stacked neatly, the edges are coapted with slight, desirable eversion, and the line shows no obvious gaps or excessive compression. The suture tails near the superior end have been trimmed, and the needle remains out of the tissue. A final smoothing pass with the fingertips confirms that the closure sits flat with uniform tension. No other incisions were handled, no additional techniques were attempted, and the closure adheres throughout to the same method used from the very first pass to the final tidy cut at the top.
