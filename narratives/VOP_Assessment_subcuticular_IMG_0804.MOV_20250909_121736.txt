Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your instrument control, bite symmetry, and knot security are sound. You maintained perpendicular needle orientation, used the Adsons gently to present tissue, and executed consistent, square instrument ties that reliably approximated the wound as you advanced from inferior to superior. Flow and economy were acceptable, with steady hand exchanges and minimal wandering off the field. However, this diverged substantially from subcuticular principles. The passage repeatedly traversed the epidermis with externalized knots, and there was no continuous intradermal track. For a true subcuticular closure, keep the needle strictly within the dermis just deep to the epidermis, advance with equal, shallow intradermal bites that mirror across the incision, and bury the start and finish (e.g., buried dermal start and Aberdeen or buried finish) or place interrupted intradermal bites with buried/off-line knots. Aim for a flat epidermal surface without eversion or track marks, using just enough tension to coapt the skin edges. Before performing this on a patient, demonstrate a full-length intradermal closure without any epidermal penetrations and with properly buried ends.
