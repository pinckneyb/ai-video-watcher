COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with several parallel horizontal practice slits, but all activity concentrates on one long, lower-third horizontal laceration. From the outset through the final frames, the surgeon returns to this same line, building up a series of discrete, well-spaced stitches that progressively approximate the wound. Variations in viewpoint and subtle camera framing sometimes make the laceration appear as the “lowest” or “second from the bottom,” but the work repeatedly localizes to the same lower horizontal slit, and the same suture line is developed from an initial pass, through repeated needle placements, instrument ties, tail trimming, and preparation for subsequent bites.

The sequence begins with deliberate setup and an initial needle pass. With the incision lying close to the bottom edge of the pad, the left hand holds a needle driver just to the left of the wound while the right hand uses fine tissue forceps at the right wound edge. The curved needle is loaded in the driver near the junction of its proximal and middle third, oriented perpendicular to the pad. The forceps gently lift and evert the right wound edge, presenting dermis for a precise near-to-far bite. The left hand advances the needle in a controlled arc across the gap. Hands straddle the slit, driver on the left and pickups on the right, converging over the line. The entry is clean and perpendicular, with depth and bite width consistent with skin closure. Suture begins to be drawn through the tissue, and a tail is left to facilitate later tying.

In the subsequent moments, attention remains on this same lower slit while the first stitch is carried to completion. The right hand continues to stabilize the near edge with the forceps as needed, while the left hand adjusts the driver grip to optimize needle angle, reloading the needle to keep its curvature aligned to the arc of tissue. The needle completes the pass, the strand is fully delivered, and the two ends are organized to prevent tangling. Tension is applied judiciously to bring the edges together with gentle eversion and without strangulating the tissue. The overall handling is measured: the driver retracts slightly when necessary to regrip the needle or to hand control over to the right hand for extraction and repositioning. Throughout, the field remains centered on the same wound, with other slits untouched.

The first definitive closure event along this line is then secured with instrument ties. Working still over the same lower horizontal laceration, the surgeon transitions from needle handling to knot tying. The left hand maintains instrument control with the needle driver, but now it is used to form loops over the standing end while the right hand alternates between controlling the free end and assisting in strand exchange. A square, layered knot is seated directly over the line, cinched down to approximate the edges. Once stabilized, scissors are brought in to trim the tails, leaving a short, neat knot near the central-right portion of the slit. Instruments remain parallel to the incision to avoid crowding. The wound edges, now joined at that point, show modest eversion and no evidence of excessive compression.

With one stitch secured, the team immediately reloads the needle to continue closure along the same line. The driver, usually in the left hand, is again oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. The right hand uses pickups to prepare the entry edge and, as needed, to guide the needle tip during passage. A new bite is initiated adjacent to the first knot along the same lower incision. The suture is drawn through, and the edges are gently brought together in preparation for tying. At times, the driver rests across the slit while the right hand manages the suture ends to maintain orientation and avoid tangling. The angle of approach to the wound remains consistent: the driver often comes in from the operator’s left at approximately 30–60 degrees to the incision line, while the pickups approach from the right to evert the edge.

In the mid-course of the repair, the surgeon builds out a sequence of interrupted stitches along the same laceration, working through a cadence of passes, tensioning, tying, and trimming. Where a stitch has just been placed, there is a tendency to momentarily pause, lay down instrument throws, seat the knot, and then bring in scissors to shorten the tails. The hands are steady and deliberate: the left hand almost always remains the driver hand, while the right hand alternates between pickups for tissue handling and direct management of the suture tail. This symmetry keeps the field organized and the bite sites visible. The driver and pickups occasionally cross over the incision as the needle is recovered or exchanged between hands, but the crossing is controlled and brief, retracting immediately to each side of the wound to re-establish a clear operating view.

Progress moves from a central portion of the slit toward adjacent segments along that same line. After one knot is trimmed, the needle is reloaded in the left-hand driver and the right hand comes in with pickups to ready the next bite. New passes are executed with the needle grasped roughly two-thirds from the tip—an optimal purchase point for controlled rotation. The tip enters perpendicular to the skin, and the needle is driven in an arc that respects the curvature, minimizing drag and trauma. The right hand stabilizes the exit side, then sometimes takes the needle with the pickups to pull it free and pass it back to the driver for reloading. Each time, the suture is drawn through smoothly and laid across the field in a way that avoids crossing over the active entry or exit points. Gauze is brought in briefly at one point to clear the strand and maintain a tidy working space.

Instrument ties recur throughout the sequence, building a series of secure knots along the same slit. With each pass completed, the left hand uses the driver to form loops around the standing end. The right hand, which has maintained the tail on the patient’s right side, alternates hands or positions as needed to switch which limb is under tension to stack the knot neatly and prevent slippage. Tension is directed inline with the incision to optimize edge approximation. The wound edges come together with each stitch, the apposition consistent and the eversion modest, indicating thoughtful placement and tie-down. Scissors enter intermittently to trim the tails after tying, and when they are not in use they are parked to the left of the field, just like the needle driver when not actively engaged.

Midway through the procedure, a new stitch is placed adjacent to previously completed knots along the same line without any diversion to other slits. The pattern is thoroughly consistent: the pickups lift the near edge, the needle holder presents the needle perpendicular to the pad surface, the bite traverses the wound in an arcing motion, then the needle is recovered and the suture is drawn through. Occasionally, the right hand grasps the needle to aid extraction and passes it back to the left hand for reloading. Wraps are formed, cinched, and seated with care to avoid excessive compression. At one interval, the left hand momentarily holds a scalpel handle above the wound, but no cutting through tissue occurs; the focus remains purely on suture management and preparation to trim, not on widening or altering the wound edges.

As the closure advances, there are frames showing preparation for the next pass without actual penetration of the tissue. In those moments, the needle lies reloaded in the driver with correct orientation—curvature ready for a perpendicular approach—and the right hand hovers with pickups near the right wound edge, prepared to evert. These brief interludes are about setup and alignment, ensuring the next bite continues the established cadence and spacing along the same wound. The surgeon pays attention to loop orientation and suture management, keeping strands away from the immediate entry site and positioning tails so they won’t interfere with the next needle path.

There is also a sequence that highlights the completion of another newly placed stitch along the line. The right wound edge is elevated with pickups to facilitate a controlled exit. The needle is pulled through to deliver the suture, and the two ends are separated into a standing end and a tail. The driver then transitions smoothly into knot-tying, laying down multiple instrument throws to secure the stitch, with the right hand toggling which limb is held under tension so the knot seats squarely. The use of gauze to manage the suture slack and keep the field uncluttered recurs when needed.

Toward the later stages, the work continues to focus on the same lower horizontal laceration, now showing several evenly spaced, approximating stitches along its length. In one sequence, the surgeon brings the needle into position at a rightward segment of the same slit, starting a new bite by entering the right half of the incision in a controlled, perpendicular manner, just as before. Even when the phrasing suggests “central” or “second from the bottom,” the operative technique and instrument choreography reveal it’s the same continuity of closure along that lower-line wound: the driver working above and left of the target point, the pickups on the right, the curvature of the needle followed faithfully through the tissue, and the suture delivered under smooth, steady traction.

Knot tying and trimming reprise at the right end of the wound, where the surgeon tightens the newest stitch to bring the edges together and then snips the tails to finish it. During tying, both hands oppose each other directly over the slit—left hand with the driver creating loops and controlling the standing end, right hand maintaining and exchanging the tail. The line of pull remains aligned with the incision, ensuring each knot seats flat, holds tension well, and does not invert the wound edges. When trimming, the left hand uses scissors brought in at a slight angle, and then both scissors and driver are set to rest on the left side of the field.

In the final moments, there is a pause in active manipulation. The same lower horizontal laceration now shows several finished stitches, the wound edges approximated with consistent spacing. Hands are out of view for much of these closing frames, and the instruments are parked to the left of the pad, parallel to the incision lines, suggesting that the sequence of passes, ties, and tail trimming has largely achieved the intended closure. A length of free suture can be seen trailing off to the right side of the pad, implying that a needle and suture were recently set down or that the operator is between bites; however, no further needle driving or knot setting occurs before the sequence concludes.

Throughout, hand positioning is consistent and precise. The left hand is the primary driver hand, maintaining control of the needle holder and performing the instrument ties. It approaches at a slight angle to the incision to optimize visibility and leverage, typically about 30–60 degrees relative to the line of the wound when positioning and nearly perpendicular when taking the actual bite. The right hand supports—initially with pickups to evert and present the wound edge, later to control the suture ends for tensioning and to aid in needle recovery. When tying, the right hand alternates limb control to help square and stack knots properly. Scissors are brought in by the left hand to cut tails close to the knots once they are snugly seated. When instruments are not actively in use, both the needle driver and scissors are placed to the left of the field for predictable re-acquisition, while the forceps and suture management happen to the right, keeping the working area centered over the same incision.

The technique remains steady and reproducible from start to finish. Each discrete stitch is placed with the needle grasped around two-thirds from its tip, presented perpendicular to the skin pad, following the needle’s curvature through the dermal layer, and exiting where the right-hand forceps stabilize the opposite edge. The bites are symmetric and consistently spaced. Knot tying employs standard instrument throws, with attention to loop orientation and tension, ensuring each knot lies flat over the incision and approximates the edges without crushing them. Eversion is modest but present, and there is no evident gapping between stitches once they are tied. When the tails are trimmed, they are cut short and clean, contributing to a tidy, organized repair.

By the end of the sequence, the lower horizontal laceration is spanned by several well-placed interrupted stitches that collectively bring the wound edges into close apposition. Any remaining free suture indicates preparation for an additional pass, but no further advancement occurs within the observed frames. The instruments rest neatly to the side, the field is clear, and the repaired line shows orderly spacing, appropriate tension, and good edges—an outcome consistent with careful, methodical technique carried out along one continuous suture line from the first pass to the final tie and trim.
