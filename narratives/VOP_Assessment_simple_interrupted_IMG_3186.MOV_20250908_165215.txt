Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
This was a cautious, organized setup with good instrument control and deliberate tissue presentation, but the lack of an executed pass and tie stalled progress. The final state remained at four interrupted sutures with an inferior gap, indicating incomplete closure despite appropriate planning and tidy line maintenance. Hand coordination was adequate and orientations were consistently perpendicular, but execution did not match preparation.
