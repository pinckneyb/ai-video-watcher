COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens at the rightmost vertical incision. With the forceps in the left hand lifting the left wound edge near its lower third, the right hand advances a curved needle held perpendicular in the needle driver, grasped about two‑thirds from the tip. A matched, symmetric pass is taken across the gap so the suture bridges the inferior portion of the slit, and the first throw begins to form, though the knot is not yet completed.

The focus then shifts to the leftmost vertical slit. The right hand, still with the needle driver, completes a near‑edge pass first while the left hand alternates between Adson forceps for precise eversion and fingertips to manage the needle and thread. The stitch’s lower bite is set, the needle is regrasped for angle, and instrument ties are performed. The knot is laid flat and squared, completing one simple‑interrupted stitch at the inferior end of the left incision.

Attention moves to the central, short vertical wound. A solitary stitch has already been placed at its very bottom. The right hand tensions this basal knot and scissors trim the tails. A fresh needle–suture is loaded in the driver for the next pass.

Working just above that bottom knot, the left hand’s forceps evert the dermal margin, and the right hand takes a right‑to‑left bite about 3–4 mm from the edge, exiting into the wound. The needle is regrasped near its tip to maintain a perpendicular arc and a mirrored bite is taken on the opposite side. The suture is pulled through, a loop forms, and instrument ties follow. The forceps are briefly used to fine‑tune edge eversion, then the left hand switches to manage the free end while the right hand lays sequential throws. The knot cinches down horizontally, leaving two closely spaced simple‑interrupted sutures in the lower half of the central incision after the tails are cut.

There’s a brief return to the right‑side long incision. With the left hand presenting the near (left) edge and the right hand approaching from the patient’s right/lower‑right, a new stitch is initiated at this line with a perpendicular entry; closure there is started but not completed within the observed moments.

Work resumes on the central wound at its superior portion. The forceps on the left elevate the near margin while the needle driver approaches from the right. A balanced, perpendicular pass is taken across the top of the slit, then the suture is drawn through and secured with instrument ties. This adds a third stitch above the two already seated, creating a neat vertical row from the lower to mid segments.

Staying on the same midline wound, the operator advances to the very top and places another stitch. The needle is held at the proximal third, driven from right to left with controlled wrist rotation while the forceps maintain eversion. The strand is pulled through in preparation for tying, and then multiple instrument throws are seated and squared. This yields a fourth stitch at the superior end.

The sequence continues with one more placement at the topmost end of the central incision. A mirrored pair of bites is taken, the suture is tensioned, and the knot is secured. With this, five simple‑interrupted stitches now span the central line from inferior to superior, keeping the edges approximated with slight eversion.

The final moments are devoted to housekeeping on this central closure. The left hand tensions the tails of the most inferior stitch while the instrument hand advances the knot to ensure it lies flat, then scissors trim the tails. Throughout these steps, the driver typically approaches from the patient’s right/superior‑right and crosses the wound, while the forceps oppose from the left/inferior side to present tissue; during tying, the driver serves as the post over the wound and the left hand manages the free end to create even, horizontal tension.

Across the video, the pattern is consistent: for each stitch, the needle is loaded near the proximal third to midpoint with its tip perpendicular to the skin; the pass is driven with smooth supination/pronation, the needle is regrasped near the tip to complete the arc, and instrument ties are used to seat squared knots. The operator alternates among the three incisions—starting a stitch on the right line, completing one on the left, and then concentrating the bulk of the work on the central incision—where four additional stitches are placed above an existing basal stitch to complete a tidy, evenly spaced row. Hands and instruments remain parallel to each active wound line, with deliberate cross‑wound movements for needle passage and controlled, opposing vectors during knot tying to maintain precise edge approximation.
