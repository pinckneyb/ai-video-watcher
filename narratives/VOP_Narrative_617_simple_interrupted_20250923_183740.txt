COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session unfolds on a synthetic skin pad laid out with several small incisions of varying orientation. Despite the multiple cuts visible at different moments, the work coheres around closing the short vertical wound on the left-center of the pad using simple interrupted skin sutures with instrument ties. Across the recording, the operator methodically advances down this vertical line, alternating between needle passage, knot tying, and trimming, while maintaining consistent control of needle angle, tissue eversion, and suture management. Periodically the camera captures brief forays onto adjacent slits for demonstration or staging, but these interludes do not alter the ongoing closure being built along the vertical cut; whenever this occurs, the surgeon returns to the vertical wound and picks up the sequence uninterrupted.

The early minutes establish instrument ergonomics and tissue handling. The operator begins by working in the upper-left quadrant, calibrating needle orientation and forceps control on a nearby small slit. The left hand holds a needle driver and the right hand uses tissue forceps to evert the dermal edge. The needle is held about the proximal third to the junction of the proximal and middle thirds, aligned nearly perpendicular to the pad surface, and driven in a smooth arc across a short superficial wound. The suture is retrieved and positioned for tying, although this particular move is completed as a setup rather than a finished stitch. Functionally, it demonstrates the same principles that will be used on the main closure: orthogonal needle entry, gentle edge elevation to expose dermis, symmetric bites on either side of the gap, and controlled rotation following the curve of the needle so the point exits perpendicular to the far edge.

Very soon the focus consolidates on the vertical wound just left of center. The operator steps in with the driver over the left side of this short slit while the contralateral hand brings in Adson forceps from the right. The forceps lift and evert the near edge without crushing, exposing a few millimeters of dermis to receive the needle. The driver delivers the needle perpendicular to the skin surface, with the curve guided in a continuous rotation so the point travels through the near dermis and emerges cleanly through the far edge at an equivalent distance from the margin. The suture is drawn through; the driver briefly regrips to improve purchase and clears any slack. With both ends presented, instrument ties are performed: the driver grasps the short tail, loops are formed with alternating throws, and the knot is snugged down centrically over the wound. The operator keeps the suture line flat as tension is applied, avoiding torsion that could invert the edges, and the knot settles with slight eversion maintained. Scissors approach to trim the tails to a reasonable length, and the result is a clean, symmetric stitch bridging the tiny vertical slit.

Around this time there are moments where the camera captures passes across a central horizontal wound and a small transverse slit, showing similar technique—orthogonal entries, minimal tissue trauma, and knot security. During these interludes the same instruments oppose each other across those wounds, bites are taken a few millimeters from the margin with the driver on one side and forceps on the other, and a stitch is tied and, in one instance, its tails cut. However, the surgeon returns to the left-central vertical wound to continue its closure. On that vertical line, the operator completes another stitch by instrument ties alone, with no new needle passage in that brief sequence—forceps lift lightly to improve coaptation as the knot is seated directly over the slit, converting a slight gape into apposed edges. The needle remains parked on the standing end during tying and is kept out of the immediate wound to avoid accidental pricks or tearing. The driver holds the standing limb, the assistant hand manages the tail, and the throws tighten in alternating directions to square the knot.

The work then proceeds through a rhythm that repeats throughout the procedure: an interrupted stitch is initiated on the vertical wound, passed with careful needle alignment and entry-exit symmetry, then secured with multiple instrument ties and trimmed. The operator makes small adjustments in hand dominance and approach angles as needed to gain optimal access to the next segment. At times the left hand brings in the needle driver from the left side of the field, at other times the right hand controls the driver approaching from the right when a different vector improves the path of the needle’s arc. Forceps remain the principal tool for tissue control, lifting only the dermal edge and avoiding any crush or torque on the epidermis. When the edges are already coapted by prior sutures, the operator sometimes forgoes the forceps and uses gentle needle pressure against the near edge or slight suture counter-tension to stabilize tissue during a pass. This is particularly evident during knot setting sequences where no new tissue penetration occurs; the driver steadies the standing limb and the assistant hand tensions the free end superiorly, allowing knots to slide down smoothly and seat flush.

Midway through the closure, the surgeon begins another interrupted stitch on the same vertical wound by entering just distal to the last knot, using the driver to hold the needle two-thirds from the tip and keeping the point perpendicular to the surface. The right hand everts and secures the target edge with pickups as the needle penetrates the near lip. The suture is advanced in a smooth arc and the needle is regripped to complete the exit through the opposing edge, keeping entry and exit points equidistant from the wound margin. Once both bites are taken and the strand is drawn across, the ends are brought together and an instrument tie cinches the knot into place. The operator alternates forward and reverse throws to build a secure square knot stack, then trims the tails with scissors introduced from the side opposite the driver to avoid crowding over the wound. Each knot lies directly over the interspace it closes, maintaining even spacing with the previously placed stitches and preserving the natural contour of the skin surface.

Throughout these steps, the operator is careful with spatial relations. The driver and forceps consistently triangulate around the bite site: one instrument stabilizes the tissue or the suture line, the other delivers the needle, and the suture strand typically arcs superiorly or laterally out of the way. When loops are formed for instrument ties, the assisting hand elevates the long limb to create space over the wound, the loop is laid over the driver’s jaws, and the driver then captures the short tail to complete the throw. Each throw is advanced down the line with deliberate, incremental tension so the knot seats snugly without crushing tissue or causing inversion.

As more stitches are added along the vertical cut, several short sequences show finalizing and trimming on that same line. The driver hovers directly above the just-tied knot, the opposite hand brings in scissors from the side, and small, even tails are cut while the driver stabilizes the knot. In a few moments the surgeon reloads a fresh needle onto the driver after trimming a knot, positioning it in the driver jaws at the proximal third with the curve once again perpendicular to the surface, signaling the next pass on the adjacent segment of the vertical wound.

In the midst of this progression, the recording intermittently captures activity on other incisions: a small horizontal line in the upper third receives a single interrupted stitch and trimming; a long horizontal wound across the mid-pad is briefly entered with a new pass; and at one point a continuous strand lies slack along an upper horizontal incision with the needle parked at the far right end while the operator rearranges tension with fingers alone. These interludes are visible but are not integrated into the building sequence on the vertical wound; there is no continuation of their line within this recording, and no knots on those horizontal lines are advanced as part of the main progression. When the operator returns to the left-central vertical wound, the technique resumes exactly where it left off: edges are everted, bites are placed symmetrically, and knots are secured and trimmed on that same vertical line.

Further along the case, the driver—now a gold-handled instrument in the right hand—approaches perpendicular to the skin to begin the next stitch immediately adjacent to the last knot on the vertical wound. Forceps from the left elevate the dermal edge and present it to the needle. The pass proceeds with a smooth wrist rotation following the curve of the needle, maintaining the needle tip’s perpendicular path to minimize tissue trauma and keep the bite depth consistent. The suture is drawn through, slack is cleared, and an instrument tie is performed to lock down the stitch. During tying the driver and opposing hand orient parallel to the wound axis, then cross as the loop is slid down to center the knot squarely over the gap. The knot is firmed with alternating throws, and the tails are cut short.

Throughout, the operator shows a consistent respect for the supple synthetic skin edges: the forceps grasp at the dermal border, not the epidermis; no undermining is needed for these shallow skin bites; and the tension applied during knot cinching is enough to coapt edges without blanching. Sequentially, stitches progress down the vertical incision, each placed within a few millimeters of its neighbor to create an evenly spaced line with slight edge eversion. Where forceps are not used, the needle itself occasionally acts as a stabilizer against the near lip, and the non-dominant hand maintains suture counter-tension to modulate the needle’s path through the tissue. In several knot-setting sequences, the needle is explicitly parked on the standing limb, kept superior-right of the wound to keep the tip safely away from the tissue and from the assistant’s fingers during throws.

Near the end of the procedure, one sequence shows completion of a stitch over the right-most end of the vertical line. The needle driver maintains control of the long strand, instrument ties are snugged to secure the stitch, and scissors arrive from the opposite side to trim tails flush to the knot. Once cut, the driver withdraws, leaving a neat knot stack among a row of similar knots. The wound edges remain well aligned, with a modest, uniform eversion and no visible gapping between stitches. The suture tails are short and consistent in length, and previous knots are evenly spaced from superior to inferior along the length of the vertical incision.

A final brief shot shows a parked needle and suture lying near the right end of a separate upper-right horizontal incision, with no active instrument contact. This appears to be a staged pause or setup unrelated to the completed closure; hands subsequently grasp the pad edges as if to reposition or remove it. By this point, the vertical wound that has been the focus throughout is fully addressed: the series of simple interrupted stitches closes the cut with good apposition.

Taken together, the technique across the case is consistent. Needle handling is orthodox: the driver grasps the needle on the proximal third to mid-shaft for control, the needle tip is kept perpendicular at entry, and the pass follows the curve to exit the far edge perpendicularly. Tissue handling is gentle and precise: forceps are used sparingly and always on the dermal edge, and when not used, the surgeon maintains edge control with needle pressure and suture tension alone. Knot tying is performed by instrument ties over the wound, alternating directions to square the knot and prevent slippage; knots are seated directly over each interspace rather than off to one side, preserving alignment. Scissors are introduced only when the knot is secure, and tails are trimmed promptly to keep the field clear. The suture strand is consistently managed superiorly or laterally to avoid entanglement with adjacent knots or instruments, and when the needle is not in use, it is parked safely away from the bite site.

Despite occasional glimpses of work on nearby horizontal and oblique slits—moments that likely reflect parallel demonstrations or staging—the closure of the left-central vertical wound proceeds in a coherent, uninterrupted sequence: place a bite with symmetrical entry and exit, draw the suture through, tie with instrument throws, and trim. The operator advances segment by segment down the line until all visible gaps are coapted. The final state is a neatly closed vertical incision, edges coapted and everted, with a tidy row of simple interrupted knots and short tails, and no remaining gaping along the line. The instruments withdraw with the field clean and the closure stabilized.
