COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a focused sequence of simple interrupted skin closures performed on a single short vertical incision located in the upper‑left quadrant of a silicone practice pad. From the first frame through the end of the recording the same left‑side wound is the target of repeated needle passes, tissue control, knot seating and eventual trimming. The operator consistently uses a two‑instrument technique—dominant hand with a needle driver and non‑dominant hand with tissue forceps or thumb forceps—to place a series of interrupted sutures along the length of that left slit. The following narrative follows the work in strict chronological order, integrating instrument handling, tissue interaction and the evolving suturing technique while noting occasional brief deviations in which the field, instruments or camera show other sutures or idle instruments.

0:00–0:14 — initial approach and first bite
The sequence opens with the operator poised above the short left vertical incision. The right hand takes a needle driver and secures a curved needle close to the tip/swage. The left hand uses fingers or forceps to grasp and slightly evert the near wound edge. The needle driver approaches from above and medially, tip angled downward, and the needle is driven through the epidermal layer of the near edge in a controlled arc. Bites are deliberately shallow‑to‑superficial, capturing dermal material without wide undermining; the non‑dominant hand steadies and aligns the edge to produce slight eversion as the needle transits. A suture strand trails from the needle, indicating a fresh pass is underway. Instrument tips converge over the wound within a small working triangle to maximize control of needle trajectory and tissue approximation.

0:15–0:29 — transfer and partial tying at the superior central region (brief field ambiguity)
Shortly after the first passes on the left incision, frames briefly show attention to a central midline incision where several interrupted sutures are already present. Although instruments and hands appear over the central wound in this interval, the left‑side slit remains the procedural focus overall; the brief central field activity appears to be either adjusting previously placed sutures or an experimental transition in the camera field. The dominant working pattern—needle driver in one hand, forceps on the tissue in the other—remains consistent with interrupted closure technique. After the transient central view, control returns fully to the left slit.

0:30–0:44 — lateral end of the same incision, adding another interrupted stitch
The operator resumes active closure at the lateral/superior end of the left slit. A rectangular midline incision is visible elsewhere on the pad, but the hands converge on the left slit. The needle driver is held vertically, grasping the curved needle near the body; the tip is pointed down as the driver rotates the needle through a tight arc to exit the far edge. The tissue forceps lift and slightly evert the near edge to expose dermal layers, and the bite is taken close to the wound margin (a small lateral bite) to approximate epidermal edges precisely. Thread is advanced through the tissue and pulled to form the loop for subsequent throws.

0:45–0:59 — continued methodical passes with consistent hand spacing
Work progresses along the left lateral wound with the dominant hand maintaining a vertical approach and the non‑dominant hand providing countertraction. The needle is held mid‑shaft, giving good leverage for a controlled puncture and withdrawal through the opposing edge. The left hand’s forceps remain adjacent to the incision, maintaining approximation and eversion. Bites are shallow to moderate depth—appropriate for epidermal/dermal closure on the simulator. After each pass the operator withdraws the driver and readies the suture tails for tying.

0:60–0:74 — another stitch placed more laterally; full‑thickness simulator bite and loop formation
The operator shifts slightly along the same leftmost vertical wound to place an additional interrupted stitch. The needle driver comes from above while forceps pinch the near edge, eversion is intentional, and the driver advances the needle across to the far edge in a controlled arc. The grasp on the needle remains relatively close to its body (not at the tip), which allows for firm rotation and predictable curvature through the synthetic dermis. The suture is partially drawn through to form a loop, and the team prepares to complete the knot sequence.

0:75–0:89 — tight coordination and instrument assistance
The instrument choreography tightens in this interval: a second instrument periodically arrives to assist with receiving the needle or managing suture tails. The right hand pinches the near edge with toothed forceps to evert the epidermis while the left needle driver repositions the curved needle for insertion through the opposite edge. Hands are within a couple of centimeters of each other; the working triangle is small, reflecting precise, controlled bites consistent with simple interrupted technique.

0:90–1:04 — suture management and knot preparation while maintaining closure line continuity
The operator continues to manage suture tails while placing additional interrupted throws lateral to earlier stitches. The left hand again controls the needle driver and the right hand manages the free suture and tissue stabilization. The needle is gripped toward its mid‑distal shaft, and the driver is brought over the incision to complete another pass. There are repeated movements consistent with preparing and seating knots: pulling the suture loop, tensioning, and readying for successive throws to secure the closure.

1:05–1:19 — lateral-most bites near wound end; coordinated instrument placement
Attention returns to the more lateral open segment of the left slit. The needle driver approaches from above while the stabilizing hand holds the tissue and suture tail just adjacent to the wound. The needle penetrates close to the margin and exits the opposite edge; a loop and trailing tail are visible as the operator begins to withdraw the driver for knot formation. Throughout these motions the hands remain closely spaced (<5 cm) to maintain precise control during transfer and tie‑downs.

1:20–1:34 — incremental placement adjacent to earlier stitches; fine instrument approach
Additional passes are placed adjacent to previously completed sutures moving from lateral toward the central portion of the left slit. The left‑hand driver approaches from the upper‑left quadrant and the right hand with forceps approximates the opposite edge from below/right, achieving eversion and exact edge alignment prior to each pass. The needle is grasped near the hub for leverage and rotated through the tissue; threads trail neatly and are prepared for knotting.

1:35–1:49 — sustained series of similar passes; consistency of technique
The operator’s technique in this segment is consistent with previous actions: needle driver in one hand, forceps in the other; bites are perpendicular to the skin plane with firm mid‑shaft grasp of the curved needle; near‑edge bites are small, giving precise edge coaptation. Each pass is followed by drawing the suture through the tissue to form a loop and prepare for a secure throw or two. Hands continue to work in close proximity to each bite for immediate suture control.

1:50–2:04 — corner/triangular incision handling (adjacent complexity but continuity maintained)
At times the operator addresses a small triangular/cross‑shaped defect near the same left third of the pad. Instruments and hands briefly move to accommodate corner bites, and the needle is passed through the corner using the same core technique (needle driver near the tip, forceps everting the edges). Despite the geometric change the operator preserves the interrupted closure approach: capturing dermal tissue close to the margins, everting appropriately, and preparing suture loops for knotting. These frames suggest controlled adaptation to slightly different wound shapes while maintaining continuity of the closure line being reconstructed along the left region.

2:05–2:19 — steady work on left slit; occasional tool switching
The operator returns fully to the left vertical incision, placing further passes in the same manner. When required, scissors or a suture‑trimming instrument are brought into play to shorten tails after knots are secured. In a few clips scissors are observed positioned over the right side of the pad, trimming previously seated knots; these moments coincide with finalization of individual stitches and do not change the pattern of repeated interrupted closures on the left slit.

2:20–2:34 — precise mid‑shaft needle grip and perpendicular entry
The left hand frequently repositions the needle driver to grasp the needle mid‑shaft, enabling a perpendicular, controlled entry into the dermis. The non‑dominant forceps persistently everts and stabilizes the near edge prior to each bite, and the operator’s hands remain in a compact working zone to guide the curvature of the needle through tissue and to catch the tip as it exits.

2:35–2:49 — sustained pattern with minor pauses for suture management
The sequence shows rhythmic repetition: bite placement, suture pull‑through, knot formation, tail trimming or management, and then repositioning to the next bite. The operator occasionally pauses with the left hand holding instruments idle at the peripheral table while the non‑dominant hand adjusts tissue orientation or inspects approximation. One short interval reveals instruments lying unused on the tray, and a single gloved hand hovers over the pad without actively passing a needle; these are brief and appear to be procedural pauses rather than a change in the operative plan.

2:50–3:04 — further passes near the lateral slit; hands & tools converge over the wound
As the sequence continues, instrument tips meet directly over the incision for needle transfer or retrieval. The non‑dominant forceps remains slightly inferior/lateral to the bite, providing countertraction as the driver approaches. The operator consistently draws the needle through until a loop forms and then prepares for knot securing. The tactile control is evident—gentle pressure, minimal excessive tension, and repeated edge eversion for optimal epidermal apposition.

3:05–3:14 — trimming and finish steps; occasional central wound activity observed
Toward the final frames the operator performs finishing tasks. Scissors are used in several clips to trim suture tails. The central region of the pad and a longer midline incision appear in the field at times where knots elsewhere are being snipped; on those occasions instruments and hands cross between wounds. These moments are logistical—they document knot trimming and final checks rather than reclassification of the main operative line. Ultimately the focus returns to final inspection and minor adjustments of the left slit’s sutures.

Throughout the entire recording the technical approach remains consistent: a classic simple interrupted pattern executed using a needle driver to control a curved needle in the dominant hand and tissue forceps in the non‑dominant hand to lift and evert wound edges. Needle grips vary between mid‑shaft and near‑tip depending on the necessary leverage and bite geometry; entries are generally perpendicular or slightly tip‑down to follow the needle curvature. Bites are placed near wound margins with small, accurate dermal captures promoting edge eversion and precise epidermal alignment. Hands maintain a compact working zone—instrument tips typically within a few centimeters—for predictable needle control and immediate suture management. Between passes the operator methodically draws suture loops through, forms secure throws, seats knots and trims tails with scissors when indicated. Occasional frames show the operator pausing or briefly attending to adjacent incisions or trimming existing knots; these are intermittent and do not interrupt the continuity of the work on the left vertical slit.

Final state
By the end of the recording the left‑side slit is uniformly approximated by a series of neatly seated interrupted sutures. Wound edges are closely opposed with slight eversion where appropriate; knots are seated and tails trimmed to short lengths. The pattern of closure is uniform along the length of the slit and demonstrates predictable, consistent technique: controlled needle arcs, close instrument coordination, and deliberate tissue handling focused on eversion and epidermal edge alignment. The closure appears secure, with no visible gross gapping or tissue puckering, and the operator concludes with routine trimming and inspection to ensure all knots are appropriately tensioned and the reparative line is cosmetically and functionally acceptable on the silicone simulator.

Notes on inconsistencies
A few brief intervals show activity centered on adjacent central or midline incisions, idle instruments on the tray, or temporary absence of needle handling; these moments appear to reflect either camera framing shifts, finishing steps on other practice wounds, or pauses for instrument exchange. They do not change the procedural fact that the left short vertical slit in the upper‑left quadrant receives continuous, systematic interrupted closure during the recording, executed with a stable two‑handed needle‑driver/forceps technique throughout.
