COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a single, short, superficial laceration along the upper row of the pad. From the first moments through the final frames, all work remains focused on this same wound. Its orientation in the camera field varies slightly over time—as the operator or pad shifts, the same cut sometimes appears more transverse, sometimes nearly vertical—but the activity never departs from this one line. The closure is executed as a series of simple interrupted stitches, with a consistent rhythm of placement, tying, and trimming, progressing stepwise along the length of the wound.

At the outset, the surgeon begins at the upper‑central portion of the line. The left hand holds a gold‑handled needle driver, the right hand uses Adson/tissue forceps to present the right wound edge. The curved needle is loaded about two‑thirds from the tip (proximal third from the swage), oriented nearly perpendicular to the pad. With a controlled wrist arc, the tip is introduced through the right dermal margin and brought into the wound, then directed toward the opposite edge. The forceps grasp a few millimeters from the margin, everting it gently to prevent inversion and to guide a symmetric bite. The driver follows the needle’s curve smoothly, with occasional regrasp to maintain a proper angle and to complete the pass.

As soon as the first pass is completed, attention turns to securing it. The needle is “parked” safely in the driver or placed down just off the field while the suture is managed for an instrument tie. The right hand controls the long limb, often drawing it laterally to the patient’s right, while the left‑hand driver captures and advances the free end. Throws are formed with clean, deliberate motions, keeping the knot directly over the slit. The edges show mild, intentional eversion as the knot is slid home; there is no excess tension that would blanch or cut the synthetic dermis. Successive throws alternate directions to lock the knot securely. With each knot set, the surgeon confirms approximation and adjusts the knot’s seat with tiny millimeter‑scale corrections. In these early phases, tying sequences recur several times over the same central segment: the needle remains attached to the long limb but is not driven during the throws, and the instruments cross above the incision predictably as each throw is advanced and snugged.

Once the first stitch is locked, the operator prepares and places the next bite immediately adjacent, still in the upper‑center of the same incision. The right hand again uses the forceps to lift and evert the right edge just next to the earlier knot, and the left‑hand driver angles the needle perpendicular to the skin to take a right‑to‑left pass. The entry and exit points are a consistent set‑back from the edge, tracking parallel to the wound. The pass is smooth: the needle is retrieved as it emerges, then regrasped near the swage to pull the suture through without tearing or torquing the tissue. The suture is drawn through with controlled tension so the loop does not saw the edge. The sequence transitions immediately back to knotting—an instrument tie with the driver capturing the free end, the opposite hand managing the standing limb. The knot is seated squarely over the new bite, again producing slight eversion and eliminating gapping.

This rhythm—precise passes alternating with careful knotting—continues as the surgeon advances along the same line. After a series of stitches around the midline, the work begins to extend toward the patient’s right end of the wound. The needle driver and forceps roles sometimes swap hands to maintain optimal ergonomics as the working focus moves: at times the right hand holds the driver over the superior/right side while the left hand controls tissue with forceps from the opposite side; at other times, particularly during ties, both hands wield drivers to improve control of the limbs. Regardless of hand dominance, the technique remains consistent. The needle is invariably held on its proximal third, perpendicular to the skin surface, and advanced with a wrist rotation that respects the needle’s curvature. The forceps—Adsons/pickups—touch tissue lightly, grasping a few millimeters from the margin to evert without crushing.

At each new site, the surgeon uses existing stitches as landmarks, keeping spacing even and entries aligned. Several sequences show the operator staging a pass: approaching from the left to take a right‑edge bite, reorienting as needed, and retrieving the needle on the far side. The suture is then drawn through, slack managed out toward the right side of the field to keep it clear, and the knot tied. In some intervals, the needle is deliberately “parked” in the driver during knot tying to prevent it from wandering into the working space, and the tying proceeds with the driver grasping a suture limb rather than the needle. When scissors are needed, they appear from the superior‑right or lateral side at a shallow angle. Tails are cut cleanly just lateral to the knot, leaving short, tidy ends. The scissors never contact tissue; they are used only to trim suture, with the needle and strand safely controlled away from the blades.

As closure proceeds along the right half of the incision, the operator continues to build a neat run of simple interrupted stitches. Bites are symmetric, entries a consistent distance from the edge, and exit points mirror the entries on the contralateral side. The forceps present the entry point by everting the near edge; then, as the driver follows through, the forceps rotate to stabilize the far edge and guide the needle tip’s exit. After each pass, the suture is drawn through with measured tension, avoiding any cheese‑wiring of the synthetic dermis.

Between placement sequences, the team frequently pauses to finish and tidy the work already done. Several segments show only knot tying and tail trimming over the same wound without additional passes; these “housekeeping” segments lock in the preceding stitches before the next bite is started. In some mid‑procedure frames, a complete pass is not captured in the images, but the movements—driver approaching perpendicular to the epidermis, forceps elevating the right edge, needle regrasping near the swage, suture being drawn through—clearly indicate preparation or completion of another adjacent stitch along the same line. At one point, the operator trims earlier tails from the superior‑right, using the driver to stabilize the knot while scissors shorten the ends; the needle rests safely off to the side. This trimming maintains a clear field and prevents the newly placed loops from tangling with long, residual strands.

As the right end of the wound comes into focus, the driver often sits just superior to the incision and the forceps just inferior or medial to the bite site, forming a small working triangle around the target entry point. The surgeon remains meticulous about orientation: the arc of the needle follows its curve through the tissue, and the driver regrasp is efficient, minimizing unnecessary hand crossing. Even where camera angles make the line appear rotated—at one point nearly vertical—the technique and activity remain exactly the same: a new stitch is placed at the extreme end of the same wound, the knot is tied and snugged, and the tails are trimmed. The pad’s rotation is the only reason for the apparent orientation change; throughout, the wound is the same upper row incision that has been progressively closed from its center toward its right terminus.

Near the far right end, the surgeon alternates rapidly between passage and tying. There is a sequence where the pass is initiated and the suture drawn through but tying is not shown; the subsequent frames pick up with the knot being formed and seated over that same bite. Another brief segment shows the operator advancing and tensioning the suture in preparation for a subsequent pass that isn’t fully visible, consistent with the regular cadence of “place, pull through, tie, trim.” Toward the end of this phase, additional knots are tied and their tails trimmed, confirming that the rightmost gaps have been addressed and secured.

After thoroughly consolidating the right half, the operator momentarily shifts to place another stitch just left of the most recent knots, filling a small remaining gap along the same top incision. The left hand steadies and everts the edge; the right hand arcs the needle through with a perpendicular approach; the suture is pulled through and the knot tied. This placement maintains uniform spacing and alignment with the earlier stitches.

Before concluding, the surgeon performs a final pass of tail management along the now‑repaired line. Scissors, sometimes held in a single hand entering from the upper side of the field, traverse from right to left trimming any long ends. The needle and free strand, when not in active use, lie safely to the side of the repaired incision. This last grooming pass leaves consistently short tails at each knot and clears the operative field of extraneous suture.

Across the entire case, several technique hallmarks remain constant:
- Needle control: The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to midpoint of its curve, with the tip oriented perpendicular to the skin. Passes follow the needle’s curvature, reducing tissue trauma and preserving the integrity of the synthetic dermis. Regrasping near the swage after breakthrough allows smooth pull‑through without levering or tearing.
- Tissue handling: The forceps handle only dermis a few millimeters from the edge, providing gentle eversion and stable presentation. There is no undue compression or crush. During tightening, edge apposition is maintained, with slight eversion and no gapping between stitches.
- Suture management: During ties, the needle is parked or kept clear of the wound; the long limb is directed laterally, often toward the patient’s right, to avoid entanglement. Instrument ties are executed with alternating throws, seated precisely over each bite. Tail trimming is deliberate and tidy, performed after knots are confirmed secure.
- Spatial ergonomics: The driver and forceps generally oppose each other across the incision, creating a narrow working corridor parallel to the wound. As the closure advances, hand dominance and instrument approach adapt to the current end of the line—sometimes the right hand drives while the left controls tissue, and vice versa—to preserve perpendicular entry and a smooth needle arc. Instruments cross at the wound only as needed to retrieve the needle or to form loops during knot tying.

By the end of the procedure, the single laceration in the upper row is fully closed with a contiguous series of simple interrupted stitches. The knots sit centered over the incision line, with tails trimmed uniformly short. The wound edges are evenly approximated with slight, consistent eversion and without undue puckering; spacing between bites is regular, and entry/exit symmetry is maintained across the line. No other incisions are manipulated at any point. Any temporary variations in apparent wound orientation are attributable to pad rotation or camera angle and do not reflect a change in the operative target. The final appearance is that of a well‑executed, methodical interrupted closure: precise passes, secure instrument ties, and clean tail management from the central portion of the wound to its far right end, with one last stitch placed just left of the terminal knots to complete a uniform, reliable closure.
