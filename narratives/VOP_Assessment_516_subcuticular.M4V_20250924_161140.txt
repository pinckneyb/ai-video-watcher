COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
This recording follows a single linear skin incision on the right side of the silicone pad and documents a continuous closure performed with a curved needle and suture material. From the outset the operator establishes an organized, two‑instrument technique—one instrument to control the needle and perform passes and the other to present and evert the tissue—then proceeds with a series of sequential passes and intermittent knotting and trimming maneuvers to secure the line as closure proceeds from the lower segment toward the superior margin.

Initial setup and first passes (0.0–44.0 s)
The procedure begins at the lower portion of the right-hand incision. The surgeon positions a needle driver in one hand and fine tissue forceps in the other, opposing each other across the wound so the driver can rotate the curved needle in an arcuate motion and the forceps can elevate and evert the near wound margin. The needle is consistently grasped away from the tip—typically about two‑thirds of the way back on the curve or at the proximal third—so that its arc can be controlled predictably. Each bite is taken approximately perpendicular to the skin surface, with deliberate wrist rotation to follow the needle curvature through dermis and subcutaneous material and exit at a symmetric distance on the far edge. After each passage the suture is drawn through, slack cleared, and the instruments are re‑positioned for the return pass. During this phase hands remain close to the incision and cross over the wound in a characteristic triangulation that maintains visualization and control.

Midline and mid-portion continuity (45.0–119.0 s)
As the surgeon moves to the mid-portion of the incision the pattern of work remains consistent: the needle driver commonly approaches from the operator’s left side and drives the needle from the near (right) edge across to the far (left) edge, while the forceps on the near/right side lift and evert tissue to present a clear bite. Regrasping the needle at different points along its curvature (proximal-mid, proximal-third, or mid body depending on the moment) allows subtle changes in arc and depth so each pass reliably captures symmetric, dermal bites without tearing the synthetic tissue. The operator continuously controls suture slack by managing the free strand to avoid tangles; the non‑driving hand intermittently pulls and tensions the strand as the needle is reloaded for the next pass. Spatially, instruments frequently cross just above the incision, working within a narrow band centered on the right vertical line. This repetitive sequence produces closely spaced, uniform passes that progressively approximate the edges.

Progression toward the distal and central segments (120.0–179.0 s)
Work advances proximally along the same right‑hand incision. The same two-handed choreography persists: a needle driver (often in the left hand) drives the curved needle with wrist pronation/supination while the right hand’s forceps evert and stabilize the wound margin. Entries are placed at consistent distances from the edge, and full‑thickness dermal bites of symmetric depth are taken to ensure coaptation. After each pass the suture is drawn through and held under light tension to approximate the edges with slight eversion—an intentional technique to promote edge apposition while preventing inversion. At several points the driver is regripped or the needle is reloaded between throws to maintain optimal orientation for the next bite; this deliberate reloading is a hallmark of the steady, controlled approach used throughout the case.

Establishing a continuous line and occasional instrument role switches (150.0–224.0 s)
Throughout the mid- and upper segments, the operator continues placing sequential sutures along the same linear track. The pattern of advancing the needle, retrieving it across the gap with forceps, and drawing suture to tension is repeated with little deviation. Instrument roles remain stable for long stretches—left hand driving the needle, right hand presenting tissue—but there are intermittent switches: occasionally the right hand assumes the needle driver or needle holder (notably later in the case during knot formation and reloading), while the left hand manipulates the suture tail or controls tension. These switches are pragmatic and short-lived; overall coordination between both hands remains tight and centered over the right incision. The needle is consistently oriented perpendicular to the skin surface at entrance and exit, ensuring consistent depth and bite geometry.

Knot tying, tightening, and suture management (225.0–284.0 s)
After placing multiple sequential passes the team begins to secure segments with instrument ties and throws. At times the operator performs successive instrument‑based throws, grabbing alternate long and short suture ends with the driver and forceps to create square, snug knots. Knot formation happens directly on top of the wound at upper segments and is performed with the same instruments that were used for needle driving—the driver captures and advances loops while the other hand maintains tension on the opposite tail. As knots are set, the wound margins draw together and any residual gaping is corrected by cinching the throws down until the edges meet with gentle eversion. In several frames the knot is specifically visualized being slid down to the wound surface and seated near the superior portion of the incision. After securing throws, the operator re‑loads the needle and prepares for the next continuous pass along the same line; at least once the scissors are brought in and used to trim an excess tail after a knot has been completed, indicating staged securement of segments rather than leaving one long tail throughout.

Refinement, additional passes, and final passages (285.0–313.0 s)
The final phase shows a series of additional passes along the upper portion of the right incision and the finishing maneuvers to complete closure. The needle is regrasped and directed across remaining open segments; the suture is tensioned to approximate the wound, and instrument ties are placed as needed to secure segments already approximated. There is a visible running strand that is periodically tensioned and repositioned, demonstrating that the closure is functioning as a continuous method rather than isolated, spaced interrupted stitches. The left and right hands continue to operate in close opposition: the driver hovers just lateral and superior to the right incision while the opposite hand controls the free tail and provides counter‑traction. The sequence ends with tightening and seating of a final knot at the superior end of the incision and trimming of excess suture material; afterward instruments withdraw and rest idle to the side.

Hand and instrument behavior across the entire procedure
From start to finish the operator maintains a predictable instrument geometry. Hands straddle the right incision, with triangulation that keeps the needle driver and forceps within a few millimeters of the wound line to maximize control. The needle is regularly grasped in the proximal-to-mid portion of its curve to allow sweeping, controlled arcs. Forceps are used to evert edges and to receive the needle tip at exit; they also intermittently assist in repositioning the needle body during retrievals. When tying, the driver alternately grasps long and short strands while the second instrument preserves tension on the opposing tail. Occasional role reversals occur—sometimes the right hand holds the driver during knotting or cutting—but these are tactical adjustments rather than a change in the overall approach.

Technique consistency and observed deviations
Overall the closure demonstrates a continuous running pattern: sequential passes are placed along the length of the right incision, the suture strand is carried along, and knots are intermittently employed to secure sections and to finish the line. The technique emphasizes symmetric dermal bites, perpendicular entry and exit, controlled wrist rotation, light eversion of edges, and careful suture management to prevent tangling. A few frame descriptions in the dataset reference activity on other incisions (central or left vertical cuts), which introduces an annotation inconsistency—however, the visual and temporal majority of frames clearly describe work concentrated along the rightmost vertical cut. When discrepancies appear they are limited to brief descriptions and do not alter the fact that the right‑side incision receives continuous, sequential work from the team.

Final appearance and closure state
By the recording’s completion the right vertical incision is closed along its length: the wound edges are approximated with slight intentional eversion, knots are seated near the superior portion where final securing took place, and excess suture tails have been trimmed. The suture line rests smoothly atop the incision with loops and throws lying directly over the wound; tissue approximation appears even and without overt gaping. Instruments and scissors are retired to the field edge, and the operator’s last actions are tensioning, knot securing, and snipping of excess—the usual steps that indicate a finished closure. The result is a continuous, neatly approximated linear closure following a disciplined, two‑instrument technique that maintained consistent bite depth, spacing and edge eversion from the lower through the upper extent of the incision.
