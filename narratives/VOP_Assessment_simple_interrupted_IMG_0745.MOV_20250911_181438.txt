Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
This is a competent execution of Simple Interrupted closure. The line is completed with four sutures, showing consistent perpendicular needle handling, controlled bites, and deliberate knot formation. Tissue handling is gentle and the edges are well approximated with slight eversion and no gapping. Opportunities for refinement remain. Even out the spacing to avoid central clustering, keep tail lengths consistent, and ensure every knot seats perfectly flat without skewed loops. With these adjustments, this technique will progress from solid to exemplary.
