Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your motion is steady, arcs are respected, and the choreography between hands is disciplinedâ€”forceps present tissue, the driver follows the curve, and ties are delivered with consistent, low, squared throws. The rhythm is deliberate and reproducible: pass, control slack, tie, trim, reload. Minor inefficiencies appear during occasional crossovers and housekeeping, but you quickly re-center and keep the suture organized.
