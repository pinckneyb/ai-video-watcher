COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The field opens on a synthetic suture pad with three parallel vertical skin incisions. The operator establishes a working rhythm around the right‑sided wound, which is a straight vertical slit of similar length to the others. From the outset, the work concentrates on this right incision and proceeds methodically from its lower portion toward the top, building a line of closure with consistent, well‑controlled technique. The left and center incisions provide context in the background and are mostly left undisturbed, aside from a brief cutaway later that shows unrelated activity.

Initial passes are made at the caudal end of the right wound. The needle is loaded two‑thirds from the tip in the needle driver, oriented almost perpendicular to the pad surface so that it can follow its curvature through the dermis rather than being driven straight. The driver approaches from above, while the opposite hand, coming from below and slightly lateral, uses Adson forceps to gently lift and evert the near wound edge. With that edge elevated, the needle is guided into the dermal margin at a symmetric distance from the cut edge, traverses following a short, controlled arc, and is retrieved on the far side. After this first pass, thread management is deliberate: the assisting hand gathers the strand to prevent snagging and keeps it out of the field, while the driver regrips the needle nearer the swage to complete pull‑through and set up for knot tying.

The pattern that follows is classic instrument‑tie work for interrupted closure. As each stitch is seated, the operator uses the driver to form throws, crosses the strand over the wound midline, and cinches the knot down until the edges just meet without blanching. Tension is balanced by opposing hands straddling the incision so the epidermal surfaces approximate evenly. Scissors are then introduced to trim tails to a short, tidy length, leaving discrete knots along the lower segment. These first maneuvers complete the anchoring stitches at the inferior end and set the tone for the remainder of the repair.

There is a brief interlude early in the recording where the camera frames a different incision: a midline vertical wound elsewhere on the pad already bearing a continuous stitch along its superior half. In that cutaway, the needle driver holds the needle at its proximal third, perpendicular to the surface, and advances sequential bites in a smooth running sequence across the inferior segment. Forceps intermittently evert the edges, and the suture is drawn through to gather the loops. This continuous pattern on a separate line is a departure from the interrupted work being developed on the right and appears to serve as a demonstration segment; the primary closure of the right‑sided incision resumes immediately afterward.

Back on the right incision, the next phase focuses on securing and tidying the initial knot at the lower end. The driver is used to tension and position the existing suture without taking a new bite, then scissors replace the driver to trim excess. The assisting hand stabilizes the long limb inferiorly, holding it clear of the wound as the tails are cut. With the inferior anchor consolidated, the operator returns to placing new stitches along the lower‑to‑mid segment.

The working triangle is consistent: the driver works from above or slightly medial to the wound, while forceps oppose it from below‑right, everting whichever edge is being pierced. In one sequence, the right hand elevates the near lip and the left hand drives the needle into the dermis, following the curve through the near side toward the wound, then across to exit symmetrically on the far edge. The thread is drawn through and handed off to prevent looping over prior stitches. When tying, the needle is sometimes “parked” safely while the driver acts as the tying instrument. The non‑dominant hand, sometimes without forceps, controls the short end and applies lateral traction to lay the knot precisely over the centerline. Throws are placed sequentially with measured tension, and scissors enter from above or from the lower right, depending on hand position at the time, to trim the tails. Throughout these steps, the edges are brought together without inversion or undue tension, and there is minimal handling of the other two incisions.

As the work advances to the mid‑segment of the wound, the operator keeps bites small and symmetric, picking up only the dermal margin. When passing from near to far, the needle is oriented perpendicular to the skin and rotated through a short working arc, then regripped closer to the tip for controlled retrieval. The forceps release and regrasp with each bite to maintain edge eversion. After each pass, slack is removed with the thread kept under light tension, and the knot is formed using instrument ties across the wound midline. Tails are cut to a consistent length as the series of discrete knots grows along the incision. In several cycles here, no additional instruments are used on the tissue; the operator relies on fingertip control of the suture tail and the driver alone to finish ties, a common approach that simplifies the field and limits tissue handling.

Midway through, another short cutaway appears: the central vertical incision is shown with a fresh interrupted stitch being placed and tied, and in a subsequent brief segment the same central wound is shown with a continuous running line lying dormant without new bites. These appearances are inconsistent with the otherwise continuous attention to the right‑sided line and likely reflect a demonstration or training insert. They do not alter the progression on the right, which resumes immediately: the driver centers over the right incision, the forceps reappear to lift the right wound lip, and scissors approach as needed from the lower right to finish knots. The closure continues to climb the wound, stitch by stitch.

In the upper‑mid segment, the needle is often held at the proximal third to midpoint for a strong purchase and short arc. The driver may be in the left hand with the forceps in the right, reversing earlier hand dominance, but the choreography remains consistent: hands straddle the wound, the driver guides the needle across, and the forceps control the edge and assist with needle exit. In some frames the needle is simply controlled without being driven—kept parked between ties or while the operator or assistant clears the thread and organizes the field. On a few occasions, the operator uses pickups to lift the wound edge or reposition an existing stitch without adding a new bite, as if inspecting approximation or removing slack before securing the next knot.

As the line approaches the superior third, fresh suture material is introduced to continue the closure. The driver reloads the needle perpendicular to the surface, and the forceps, now on the right edge, evert the tissue for entry. Before the new pass, a quick gauze wipe clears the field. The needle then takes the next bite at the top of the wound, reinforcing the steady progression. The thread is drawn through and arranged, and a knot is formed to secure this segment. Even when the operator’s right and left hands trade roles—sometimes the right hand holds the needle driver and performs the pass while the left controls the strand, other times it’s reversed—the alignment relative to the incision remains stable: instruments parallel the wound, they approach from opposing sides, and they cross over the midline only during tying.

Near the end, the sequence transitions to finishing maneuvers. The right‑side incision already bears multiple completed stitches with well‑approximated edges. The needle is controlled but not used to take further bites while tension is adjusted on the last few loops. An assistant’s gloved hand occasionally enters from the left, presenting scissors so tails can be cut while the primary hand maintains control with the driver. Cuts are made close to the knot, leaving short, neat ends, and the last throw is cinched down precisely over the wound. There is a brief moment where the visual appearance suggests a continuous or locked finish at the upper‑middle segment. Even in this finishing flourish, the operative behavior remains consistent with prior steps: the driver stabilizes, scissors approach in a coordinated fashion, and the suture is trimmed cleanly with the instruments kept parallel to the wound.

Throughout the entire repair, spatial discipline is notable. Hands stay on opposite sides of the incision when passing the needle to avoid crossing and obscuring the view. The driver’s tip is kept close to the wound edge, minimizing the working distance. When tying, the instrument crosses the wound midline deliberately to lay the knot centrally, then retreats. The assisting hand controls the long limb away from the field to maintain a clear path for the next move. Instruments not in immediate use are placed off to the side of the pad. When scissors enter, they do so from a predictable vector (often the lower right or from the left via an assistant), and they leave immediately after trimming to reduce clutter. Each stitch is completed before the operator advances to the next bite site, preserving a steady cadence of pass, pull‑through, tie, and cut.

Tissue handling remains gentle throughout. The forceps grasp only the dermal margin to evert the edges, avoiding crushing the epidermis. Bite depth and width appear even from side to side, promoting symmetric approximation. There are no undermining maneuvers; the work stays superficial in the skin layer appropriate for a standard pad closure. When tension is applied, it is just enough to coapt the edges without causing inversion or undue blanching. In segments where forceps are not used, the operator relies on the suture to draw the edges together, but even then, edge alignment remains true, with no gapping between stitches.

The knotting technique is consistent: instrument ties with multiple sequential throws are positioned squarely over the incision, and tails are trimmed short after each knot. The needle is secured in the driver at the proximal third to mid‑body for each new pass, and the driver’s wrist motion follows the curve, rather than pushing the needle linearly. When regripping mid‑pass, it is done near the needle tip to maintain control and a compact arc of motion. On several occasions the needle is held idle (“parked”) while the operator uses the driver to complete ties, reflecting efficient instrument use and continuity of control over the suture strand.

By the end of the sequence, the right‑sided incision is closed along its length with a series of well‑spaced, neatly tied sutures. The edges are evenly approximated with mild eversion, and the tails are trimmed uniformly short. The field is clean; unused incisions remain largely untouched except for the noted brief cutaways that do not alter the outcome on the right. The final passes toward the superior third culminate in a secure tie and a last trim, after which the instruments withdraw. A brief hover of a hand over the completed line confirms there are no further adjustments needed. The closure presents as orderly and secure, with consistent technique applied from the inferior anchor through the midsection to the superior end, leaving a straight, well‑approximated skin line ready for dressing. Where the video briefly showed suturing on other lines and a visual suggestion of a continuous finish, these moments appear to be extraneous or instructional cutaways; the dominant method carried through the right‑sided wound is a systematic, interrupted closure with instrument ties and careful, symmetric tissue handling, completed without complication.
