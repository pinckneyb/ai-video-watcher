COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel vertical slits. From the outset, the closure focuses on the central midline incision. The lateral cuts are visible throughout as reference lines or practice sites but are not part of the main closure. When activity is briefly seen near a lateral slit, it does not alter the course of the central repair; the work sequence, instrument choreography, and progressive wound approximation all develop along the midline line from inferior toward superior until the closure is complete.

The case opens with the team establishing control and orientation at the center wound. The right hand holds a needle driver and the left hand brings in Adson forceps to stabilize and gently evert the near skin edge. The needle is loaded in the driver approximately at the proximal third to midpoint, with its curve kept perpendicular to the skin surface so that the wrist can rotate the needle through in a controlled arc. The left forceps grasp the dermal edge lightly, without crushing, to present a perpendicular bite. The right hand aligns the needle across the midline gap and initiates the first bite. With a smooth wrist-driven motion, the needle penetrates the near margin and arcs through the dermis toward the far side, maintaining an even depth and staying an appropriate distance from the wound edge to promote reliable apposition without strangulation. The suture strand trails cleanly; the left hand alternates between supporting the tissue and managing the free end to prevent tangling. After the needle sits in the far dermis, the driver regrips near the swage or mid-body to pull the needle through and present both limbs for tying.

With the first pass across completed, attention turns to securing the stitch at the inferior portion of the incision. The left hand now predominantly holds the needle driver over the center/bottom of the midline wound while the right hand alternates among tissue forceps, suture tail control, and, ultimately, scissors for tail trimming. The needle is parked out of the immediate tying field. Using the driver to grasp the suture and the right hand to control the free end, the operator places the initial throws, alternating direction to square the knot. The throws are laid with the driver crossing the incision and then brought down squarely to the centerline, cinching the knot onto the wound without over-tightening. Once the initial stitch is secure, the scissors are used to trim the tails to a modest length. At this stage, the inferior third of the central slit has its first knot seated and trimmed, establishing the cadence for the remainder of the closure.

Work then shifts slightly superior to this first knot. The left hand resumes control of the needle driver, while the right hand uses forceps to steady the right wound edge, maintaining gentle eversion and a reliable target for the next pass. The operator checks orientation: the needle is reloaded at its proximal third and aligned perpendicular to the epidermal surface. Before driving, the previously tied stitch is lightly tensioned to confirm approximation; the right hand draws the free end of the last suture upward, then transitions to help reload and present the needle. The next bite is taken just above the previous knot. The technique is consistent: enter at a symmetric distance from the edge, rotate through dermis, exit the far edge at a mirror point, and pull the strand through while the right hand manages counter-tension on the opposite limb. With both limbs retrieved, the left hand leverages the driver to perform instrument ties; the right hand positions the long limb and maintains steady, gentle counter-tension to seat each throw neatly over the incision. The knot is snugged centrally, the edges are observed to approximate without blanching or inversion, and the tails are trimmed once the knot is secure.

Across these early steps, the operator demonstrates a controlled, methodical pattern. Hand roles are well defined, though they are not rigid; the driver switches hands at times to maintain ergonomics and a perpendicular approach as the working focus moves cranially. Forceps are brought in when needed for fine tissue control—particularly to evert skin edges before needle passage—and are purposefully set aside during tying to avoid unnecessary manipulation. When tying, the needle is often parked on the long strand off to one side, and the driver’s jaws grasp the suture near the intended knot site to execute alternating instrument throws. The suture is kept oriented along the wound axis to prevent entanglement and ensure that knots seat precisely over the midline.

Amid this central-line closure, there are brief moments in which instruments are seen near a lateral incision, most notably on the right-hand slit. In these brief interludes, the left hand appears to drive a needle across that peripheral cut with the right hand using tissue pickups to evert the edge; in one segment, the operator even begins instrument ties at that lateral wound. These moments are isolated and do not continue. They read as incidental practice movements or demonstrations outside the main task. They do not change the ongoing closure plan at the center, do not contribute to a separate line of sutures in the final view, and are best understood as off-sequence interludes in a training context. Throughout, the midline repair is the continuous, cohesive activity that advances from one completed stitch to the next.

Returning to the central incision, the sequence continues with another stitch placed and tied at the mid-portion. The right hand maintains the free limb while the left hand executes a series of alternating instrument throws. The knot is cinched down over the incision, and tail length is adjusted for consistency. No tissue forceps are used on the wound edges during tying in these scenes; the edges are controlled entirely by suture tension. The technique remains steady: knots are constructed in a square configuration, with the driver alternating direction across the line and seating each throw before the next is placed. The closure progresses cranially with each completed stitch, keeping spacing consistent and exit/entry points symmetric across the wound.

In the next passage sequence, the right hand returns to the driver and the left hand takes up forceps again. The curved needle is maintained perpendicular to the pad surface and grasped on its proximal-to-mid body. With cross-hand positioning, the driver approaches from the operator’s right side while the forceps lift and evert the left or right edge opposite the driver. Each bite traverses from one dermal edge to the other in a smooth arc; the driver regrips the needle as needed to draw it through without distorting the tissue. The left hand periodically releases to clear slack or to guide the suture tail so that the strand lies cleanly along the wound and does not kink. After each bite, the suture is tensioned just enough to bring the edges together. When the depth and spacing are satisfactory, knot tying resumes with the driver, and the scissors re-enter briefly to trim the tails after security is confirmed.

As the closure advances to the upper middle portion of the wound, the instrument choreography adapts slightly. The left hand often holds the needle driver over the superior half of the incision while the right hand—now with red-handled tissue forceps—stabilizes the right edge and gently lifts it to present the bite. This cross-hand stance allows the driver to approach from the operator’s left or superior-left, maintaining the preferred perpendicular needle orientation as the working zone migrates cranially. The needle is grasped roughly two-thirds from the tip, and after penetration the driver switches grip near the swage to finish drawing the needle through. The right hand occasionally grasps the suture itself with the forceps to manage the strand’s path, preventing loops from catching. The wound edges are observed to approximate with slight eversion as the suture is drawn through, preserving alignment with the earlier stitches.

In successive frames, another stitch is added just above the last knot. The right hand alternates between controlling the free suture end and gently steadying the skin with fingertips near the bite sites. With the needle parked, knot tying is initiated: the driver grasps the suture near the wound, the right hand brings the long limb across, and alternating throws are placed. The knot is seated centrally, and the strands are trimmed. A consistent rhythm is evident—pass, draw through, instrument tie, trim—repeated methodically along the length of the central incision.

Through the upper portion of the line, there is a sequence in which the suture appears to traverse sequential bites with tension applied after each passage, and the needle is regrasped to reposition for the next bite. Though this might resemble a continuous sequence at a glance, in this context it reads as the operator maintaining efficient strand management and tissue presentation between discrete stitches. The same principles are upheld: the needle moves in a perpendicular arc; forceps intermittently evert edges to ensure good dermal purchase; slack is drawn out to lay the strand cleanly along the incision; and tying follows after the necessary passes are completed at that level. When the next knot is ready to be secured near the upper-mid section, the left hand again takes the driver to perform instrument ties while the right hand maintains counter-tension, followed by scissors to finalize tail length.

As the line nears completion, the suture pattern remains consistent and orderly. The operator continues to oppose hands across the wound—driver on one side, forceps or suture control on the other—maintaining a two-handed approach that keeps the field open and the edges well presented. The needle is continuously reloaded at the proximal third to mid-body for optimal leverage, the arc remains perpendicular to the plane of the skin, and entry/exit points are positioned symmetrically across the incision. With each new stitch, tensioning is deliberate: just enough to draw the edges together without rolling them inward or creating excessive compression. The suture is routinely directed cranially and laterally while tying to keep the knot path clear and prevent the strand from sawing across the wound surface.

Periodically, after a knot is completed, the operator pauses to adjust tail lengths and to visually confirm that each knot sits squarely over the midline. Short, neat tails are left, projecting minimally from the skin surface. When cutting, the scissors approach at a controlled angle with the non-dominant hand stabilizing the knot to avoid accidental loosening. After trimming, both hands withdraw, showing a centered view of the midline with evenly spaced stitches and well-approximated edges. At times, instruments rest on the field—scissors on the left or right, a driver set aside while reloading—before re-engaging the wound, reflecting deliberate, unhurried transitions between steps.

The hand roles evolve naturally to maintain ergonomics and visibility. Early in the sequence, the right hand frequently holds the needle driver, with the left hand using forceps to present tissue. As the work migrates superiorly, the left hand increasingly holds the driver while the right hand uses red-handled forceps to stabilize the far edge. During knot tying, the driver often remains in the left hand while the right hand controls the free limb to provide the necessary counter-tension. This fluidity allows the operator to keep the needle perpendicular to the wound, execute controlled arcs, and seat knots directly over the centerline without awkward wrist positions. Whenever the instrument position risks obscuring the field or forcing a shallow angle of attack, the roles switch, re-establishing a straight, perpendicular path for the needle and a tidy approach for tying.

The final active sequence shows a newly placed stitch in the upper-mid segment being secured with multiple throws. The driver crosses the incision perpendicularly during tying, the right hand balances the opposing limb, and the knot is cinched down firmly but gently. The scissors then trim both ends to final length. Immediately afterward, the scene pauses: hands have withdrawn, and the central vertical incision is displayed with a line of completed stitches approximating its edges. The lateral incisions remain untouched in this final view. The sutures along the midline sit evenly and symmetrically; the dermal edges are brought together with mild eversion and without obvious gapping or excessive tension. Short tails are visible along the line, consistent with a series of properly completed interrupted knots.

Taken as a whole, the procedure demonstrates a standard, methodical interrupted closure of a straight midline skin incision. The landmarks and technique are consistent throughout:

- The central wound is engaged exclusively for closure, progressing from the inferior region up toward the superior end.
- Each stitch is planned with entry and exit points kept equidistant from the margin to produce symmetric purchase across the gap.
- The needle is consistently grasped on the proximal third to mid-body and kept perpendicular to the skin, with controlled wrist rotation to complete the arc.
- The non-driving hand presents tissue with forceps when needed to achieve gentle eversion and to avoid shallow or oblique bites.
- After each pass, the suture is drawn through while managing slack carefully so the strand lays neatly along the wound without snagging.
- Knots are formed with alternating instrument throws to produce square, stable constructions centered over the incision line; they are tightened under vision to avoid over-compression, and tails are trimmed short for a clean finish.

Where frame-to-frame context suggests brief activity at a lateral slit or a sequence that could be mistaken for a running pass, these are isolated deviations in a training setting that do not affect the integrity or continuity of the main closure. The dominant and cohesive narrative remains a single, orderly series of interrupted stitches advancing along the midline, each placed, tied, and trimmed before moving on.

By the end of the video, the central incision is fully approximated with multiple evenly spaced knots. The wound edges align along the centerline with mild eversion, and there is no evidence of undue tension or inversion. Instruments have been set aside—scissors rest on the table—and no further manipulation is underway, indicating completion. The closure is tidy, consistent, and secure, with a uniform appearance from the inferior to the superior end of the midline incision.
