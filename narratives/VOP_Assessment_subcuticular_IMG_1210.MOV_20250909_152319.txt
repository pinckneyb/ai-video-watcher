Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
You showed basic needle control and some competent use of forceps for eversion at the superior end, with the needle held appropriately on the curve and regrasped without bending. Isolated bites displayed acceptable mirror symmetry and controlled traction. However, you did not establish a subcuticular track: your passes repeatedly traversed near-to-far rather than progressing in a horizontal dermal plane, and the case ended with only a corner anchor and no advancement along the incision. Plan and flow were the primary failures. You initiated attempts at both ends, tied, then converted to an anchor without building a running intradermal path, leaving the wound unclosed. Efficiency suffered from repeated, non-advancing passes and a detour away from the active line. To meet subcuticular standards, start with a deliberate buried (or lateral) anchor, then take evenly spaced, shallow dermal bites 1–2 mm from the edge, advancing 3–4 mm per step while keeping the needle trajectory parallel to the skin surface and maintaining consistent depth on both sides. Avoid using suture traction for eversion, keep the driver tip off tissue as a retractor, and finish with a proper buried or lateralized exit and secure tie. The current performance does not meet expectations for a safe, competent subcuticular closure.
