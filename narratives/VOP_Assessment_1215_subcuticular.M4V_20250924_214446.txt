COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses entirely on the vertical incision at the far right side of the silicone practice pad. From the first frames through the last, the operator consistently returns to that lateral slit, placing sequential skin closures adjacent to an already-completed central column of interrupted sutures. Throughout the recording the work alternates between precise needle delivery, tissue manipulation and suture management; the overall goal—progressive approximation of the rightmost skin margin to match the central closed wound—is maintained from start to finish.

Opening actions and approach (0–60 seconds)
At the outset the practitioner positions both gloved hands over the right‑hand slit, with the needle driver and tissue forceps poised to cooperate across a very small working field. The needle is a curved surgical needle mounted on black monofilament; the driver typically grasps it away from the tip, often at the midpoint or proximal-third of the shaft, to allow controlled rotation through a shallow to moderate dermal bite. The non‑dominant hand uses Adson-style forceps or fingertip grip to elevate and present the near wound edge. The driver regularly approaches from the operator’s left/upper quadrant while the forceps stabilize from the right/lower aspect, and the instruments meet over the incision centerline with hands approximately 2–4 cm apart.

Needle trajectories are generally perpendicular-to-oblique to the wound: the operator advances the needle in a controlled arc from the lateral near edge toward the opposing medial edge, transfixing only the superficial-to-mid dermal layer of the silicone. Careful presentation of the tissue by the forceps produces slight eversion as each bite is taken; bites are executed with visual control and minimal bunching. Early passes show the surgeon pulling the suture through and laying the free tail across the pad for later tying, while the central column of interrupted sutures remains undisturbed and serves as the closure template.

Repeated placing of interrupted stitches (60–210 seconds)
Across the next several minutes the pattern is highly consistent: left-hand needle driver delivering the curved needle, right-hand forceps lifting and approximating the opposing edge, then the needle transfixing tissue and the suture being pulled through. Hand dominance alternates in a few sequences—occasionally the right hand holds the driver and the left the forceps—but the spatial relationship is preserved: instruments flank the slit and converge immediately over it. The needle grip varies slightly from frame to frame (mid‑shaft, proximal-mid, sometimes nearer the swage), but every pass aims to capture epidermal/dermal tissue without excessive depth or strangulation.

During these segments the surgeon frequently repositions the needle to achieve an ideal bite angle, rotating the driver to present the curved needle’s tip. The non‑dominant forceps both evert and precisely approximate the tissue, preventing inversion. The motions are tight and coordinated, with short, deliberate arcs. In a number of frames the operator uses the fingertip grip to manipulate the needle directly—especially when orienting the needle for the final few millimeters of passage—before re-grasping it with the driver; this subtle switch between direct finger control and instrumented control is employed when fine adjustment is required in the shallow working space.

Mid‑procedure variations and suture management (210–300 seconds)
As the sequence continues the practitioner alternates between placing new passes and preparing previously passed sutures for tying. At times a loop of suture lies across the pad while the next pass is prepared; in other frames a long tail is visible and pulled through as the operator positions for knotting. Instrument crossing over the incision is a recurring theme—the driver and forceps form an “X” over the wound to facilitate needle transfer and controlled pull-through.

Most needle entries remain tangential to perpendicular and continue to engage only simulated dermis. Tissue handling is consistently gentle: forceps hold minimal tissue and apply light countertraction to evert margins. Several frames show the operator using a long needle driver as a platform or countertraction instrument while the finer forceps place the needle—this combination helps control suture tension and keeps bites uniform.

A single set of frames (around 270 seconds) includes an observation of successive bites with a relatively long suture tail in place; that appearance could suggest the commencement of a continuous run. However, the broader pattern of individual passes, subsequent suture pulling and recurring knot-tying maneuvers in adjacent frames supports the interpretation that the operator is following an interrupted closure strategy. Where observations diverge—longer tails or sequential passes without immediately visible knots—the rest of the sequence shows return to individual bite-and-tie actions, so the interrupted approach remains the consistent method.

Technique refinement and knot formation (300–360 seconds)
Later in the recording the operator occasionally shifts the way the needle is manipulated. In a number of frames the curved needle is handled by the fingertips rather than clamped in a driver for short rotations and final seating; in others the operator again engages the needle driver, grasping near the swage to present the tip for a clean pass. These intermittent changes reflect micro-adjustments: fingertip control for tactile placement in a confined area and instrument control for the force required to pass the needle through the synthetic dermis.

As passes are completed, knot-tying activity becomes more evident. The surgeon stabilizes the stitch with forceps and brings the long tail into position for a series of throws—finger or instrument-assisted—so that each interrupted stitch can be locked. Knot formation is performed in the same hand configuration as needle passage: one instrument controls the suture loop while the other maintains tissue apposition. This preserves wound edge alignment and minimizes slippage during knotting. Some frames show the operator trimming suture tails with scissors and readjusting tension to achieve subtle edge eversion where needed.

Hand position evolution over the entire case
Hand placement is tightly constrained to the right-hand slit for the whole procedure. From the first pass to the last, both hands remain over the lateral incision with only occasional movement away to pick up instruments or cut tails. The driver mostly approaches from the left/upper quadrant and the forceps from the right/medial side. The hands stay approximately within a 1–6 cm separation band depending on the task—closer during needle transfer and slightly wider when preparing to tie or cut.

The evolution shows a steady rhythm: initial passes use a traditional driver/forceps pairing; mid‑procedure the operator sometimes manipulates the needle directly with the fingertips for fine orientation; later, with sutures through the wound, the hands focus increasingly on knot security and tail management. Instruments occasionally rest unused on the board, and there are brief moments when scissors or an alternate clamp are brought into play to trim tails or provide countertraction; these are transient and do not alter the overall workflow.

Consistency and quality of tissue handling
Throughout, the operator demonstrates intentional, conservative tissue handling: bites are shallow-to-moderate to engage dermal equivalent tissue, and forceps tent rather than crush skin simulant. Edge alignment is precise, with slight eversion produced deliberately by the forceps during bites—a standard approach to ensure epidermal edge coaptation and prevention of inversion. There is no evidence of aggressive deep bites capturing subcutaneous layers; the focus is skin-level approximation.

Occasional departures from textbook instrument technique are observed—specifically, intermittent fingertip needle manipulation rather than continuous use of the driver—but these appear to be pragmatic adjustments for better control in a constrained space rather than systematic lapses. Where sequence elements could be interpreted as a continuous suture (a long tail carried between bites), the operative behavior returns repeatedly to an interrupted pattern with knotting between passes.

Spatial choreography and instrument dynamics
The procedure is performed in a compact workspace. Instruments repeatedly cross over the incision axis to facilitate needle transfer and suture pull-through. The left/right approach of the driver and forceps is preserved, and the hands coordinate brief rotations as the curved needle completes its arc. The non‑dominant hand alternates between presenting tissue and maintaining suture tension for knot tying; the dominant hand cycles between needle driving, suture pulling and knot throws. When the driver is temporarily unused, the operator relies on finger control to orient the needle and then re-engages the driver to effect passage or to manipulate the suture.

Final configuration and wound closure state
By the end of the recording the lateral incision has been approximated along its length with a series of adjacent skin closures that visually match the existing central column. Most recently placed stitches show suture tails that have been pulled through and are in the process of being secured; several knots have been formed and some tails trimmed. The wound edges are uniformly opposed with slight, controlled eversion across the closure, and there is no gross tissue bunching or gaping. Central sutures remain intact and unperturbed throughout—serving both as a visual guide and as a stable anchor for the lateral work.

Summary assessment
The operator consistently employs a controlled, iterative interrupted skin‑closure technique on the rightmost vertical slit. Needle handling is deliberate—curved needles grasped mid‑to‑proximal shaft, driven in an arc with coordinated countertraction by the forceps—producing shallow-to-mid dermal bites and slight eversion for ideal epidermal apposition. Hand positions remain closely coordinated and localized to the incision, with pragmatic shifts between fingertip and instrumented needle manipulation when needed. Instances that could be read as continuous-suture behavior are transient; the overall workflow returns to individual passes with knotting, so the interrupted closure paradigm is preserved. The final appearance of the slit is a neatly approximated, consistently approximated line of skin closures that integrates seamlessly with the pre-existing central sutures.
