============================================================
Overview
From the first frame through the end of the recording the team repeatedly returns to and completes a single horizontal skin incision located near the superior margin of the pad — the incision that is consistently presented, prepared, and closed with individual passes and instrument-tied knots using the selected suturing technique. The sequence shows methodical placement of interrupted stitches along that same wound: loading and reloading a curved needle in the driver, opposing bimanual control to evert and present each dermal edge, passing the needle at near‑perpendicular angles, drawing the suture across, and securing each pass with instrument ties. Instruments are handled with deliberate economy — a needle driver and fine tissue forceps are exchanged between hands as needed, scissors and hemostats remain largely idle on the field — and the operators maintain consistent spatial relationships and approach angles to protect tissue and achieve eversion.

Beginning of the case (0–60 s)
The procedure begins with the team working at the superior horizontal incision near the top center of the pad. The needle is routinely grasped in the driver at the proximal third of its curve and oriented to enter the wound at an approximately 90° angle. From the outset one hand controls the driver while the other uses fine Adson tissue forceps to pick up and evert the near edge, providing a clear apposing surface for the needle. The needle is advanced in a controlled curvilinear arc through the left dermal margin and driven toward the midline, following the needle’s curvature. After the tip exits the opposite side, the suture is drawn through so that a loop spans the wound in preparation for tying.

Hands are opposed across the incision in a narrow working triangle: the driver approaches from one side, the forceps present the other edge and act as the receiving instrument. Scissors and other instruments rest on the tray and do not intervene. Early passes demonstrate careful, perpendicular bites taken a few millimeters from the wound edge with gentle eversion; there is no excessive crush to the synthetic dermis. The operator keeps the suture strand controlled and clears slack on each pass so that subsequent instrument ties can be performed without tangling.

Intermediate preparation and tie sequences (15–90 s)
Following initial passages, the team moves into standard instrument-tie work on the same incision. The needle is often parked to one side while instrument throws are formed: one instrument is used as a post (held superior to the incision) while the other driver wraps and pulls the free end through the formed loops. The forceps frequently act as the post or to control the short tail for tensioning. These frames show tight coordination: the driver crosses over and then returns to a parallel orientation to seat each throw, with the assisting forceps maintaining tail control and minor edge stabilization.

Throughout this interval the needle continues to be reclamped and repositioned in the jaws to preserve a 90° entry and to keep the needle arc centered for predictable tissue advancement. The operators repeatedly check spacing and alignment with a finger or the instrument tips to keep adjacent bites evenly spaced. Where the description shows temporary absence of active needle passes, the hands remain close to the incision, ready to resume placement. At one point the right hand briefly palpates near the wound while instrument drivers are parked, indicating a short pause between passes; no new passes are made during that pause.

Systematic placement along the incision (75–165 s)
After initial passes and tying sequences the work continues longitudinally along the incision. Needle handling is consistent: the curved needle is grasped roughly one- to two-thirds from the swage, oriented perpendicular to the surface, and the driver applies wrist rotation to bring the needle through the dermis. The assistant or second instrument persistently everts the appropriate edge immediately adjacent to each entry point. Bites are taken symmetrically from both edges and the suture loop is gently drawn through and organized across the wound before the opposing bite is taken or before knot tying.

Hand roles alternate across frames: sometimes the left hand drives the needle while the right provides countertraction with forceps; sometimes the right hand holds the driver with the left hand acting as assistant. This interchangeability preserves ergonomics and allows each operator to adjust grip and orientation as the stitch line progresses. The needle is frequently reloaded after exits to maintain an optimal grasp point for the next arc. Throughout these sequences the team maintains tissue eversion with gentle, atraumatic forceps use and keeps the instruments close and parallel to the incision line to maximize visibility.

Midcase reorientation and continuity (120–240 s)
As the procedure advances, there are short periods when camera perspective or pad orientation is described differently (some frames refer to a “central” or “middle” slit). The selected technique and the working pattern remain the same; where descriptive labels appear to shift, the actors continue to tend to that same superior/top incision as the target of each pass. Occasionally the needle is temporarily removed and a fresh needle-suture loaded to continue the same closure sequence; this is executed efficiently so that stitching along the incision is uninterrupted in intent and cadence.

During these minutes the operators routinely clamp the needle at a stable position on the driver, approach the wound edge from a consistent angle, and have the assistant present the opposing margin. Passes continue to be orthogonal to the wound and follow the needle’s curvature to exit the far side without dragging or jagged entry. The suture strand is tensioned and directed away from the wound after each pass to prevent entanglement for the subsequent bite. Knot-tying episodes recur: instrument throws are created, tightened, and cut down (in many frames the scissors remain on the field but are not always shown cutting; where short tails are seen they are neat and controlled).

Late-case refinement and multiple ties (225–300 s)
Toward the later portion of the recording the operators place further interrupted stitches along the same horizontal incision, working from one end to the other. The technique remains consistent: perpendicular entry, gentle edge eversion, follow-through of the needle arc, and suture management to permit clean instrument ties. The team uses the forceps intermittently to act both as a tissue grasper and as a post when tying — a typical instrument-tie strategy in which one instrument stabilizes the standing limb while the other is used to wrap and seat the throws.

There are moments when the driving hand repositions and regrips the needle to adjust the bite depth and approach angle, and moments when hands cross briefly over the wound during pull-through or knot cinching. Instrument tips meet just above the incision while knots are seated; ties are advanced centrally and then snugged to approximate tissue without inversion. The operators largely avoid crushing the synthetic dermis; the eversion of the margins is maintained so that the endpoints of each stitch sit slightly everted when cinched.

Final passes, reloads, and completion (300–355 s)
In the final phase the team finishes placing and tying the remaining interrupted stitches along the same incision. Where a needle is expended in a previous pass they switch to a fresh needle-suture and resume the same bites, taking care to preserve consistent spacing and symmetry with earlier stitches. When not actively passing a needle, the needle drivers and forceps are parked adjacent to the pad; during a brief pause one operator lightly palpates the sutured area to assess tension or to plan the next bite.

The last tying sequences mirror earlier technique: controlled instrument throws performed with one instrument acting as post, the other forming and pulling loops, and the forceps occasionally used to stabilize the tail. Knots are drawn down until the wound edges are well approximated with the desired slight eversion. After knotting, tails are trimmed or kept short and controlled; the adjacent previously sutured lower incision (which had been closed earlier in the case) remains undisturbed throughout these finishing actions.

Technique consistency and evolution
Across the entire recording the selected technique is performed with high consistency. The fundamental elements — perpendicular needle entry, proximal-to-midpoint needle grasp, use of fine forceps for eversion and control, instrument ties to secure each interrupted pass, and reloading of the needle-driver when the needle orientation requires correction — are present from start to finish and are repeated for each stitch. The team refines their ergonomics as the line progresses: hands remain close to the wound and operate within a narrow, efficient working triangle; roles shift flexibly between driver and assistant to maintain optimal orientation and visualization. When tying, they repeatedly use instrument ties with one instrument as a post and the other wrapping the free end, which both conserves space and keeps the knot-tying sequence reproducible.

Hand position and spatial relationships
From the outset the hands oppose each other across the wound: one provides driving force with the needle driver, the other offers countertraction and edge presentation with forceps. The driver typically approaches from slightly superior/left or superior/right depending on which hand currently carries it, and the forceps sit just lateral to the entry/exit points to present and evert the dermal edges. Instrument tips meet just above the incision during pull-through and knot seating. Over time, as more stitches are placed, the operators shift incrementally along the length of the incision: the driver and forceps move in tandem from one bite site to the next while maintaining the same relative positions and approach angles. When knots are tied the driver crosses over and then returns to a parallel position to maintain efficiency and hand clearance.

Final appearance and wound closure
By the conclusion of the recording the treated incision is closed with a series of individually tied interrupted stitches. Each knot is seated centrally over its pass; the wound edges are approximated with slight eversion, no obvious tissue crushing is apparent, and suture tails are kept short and under control. The technique and execution produce a tidy, evenly spaced closure along the original linear defect. Brief procedural pauses, occasional repositioning of the needle, and temporary parking of instruments were observed but did not interrupt the overall progression of placing and securing sequential interrupted passes along the same incision.

Notes on observational inconsistencies
A minority of frames describe nearby slits (central, middle, or lower) or show periods when hands are temporarily away from the working area and instruments are parked. In the interest of continuity, these moments represent either camera perspective changes, pad rotation, or short pauses rather than a change in the chosen closure. Where the description suggests a needle exchange or a short palpation pause, those actions were preparatory steps that enabled continuation of the same technique. Overall, the procedure reflects a disciplined, repeatable interrupted closure of the superior horizontal incision, with consistent needle handling, edge eversion, and instrument-tied knots culminating in a well-approximated wound.
