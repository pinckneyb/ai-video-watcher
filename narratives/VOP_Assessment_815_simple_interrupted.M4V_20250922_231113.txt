COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a three‑slit practice pad, but attention throughout is devoted to a single vertical wound that functions as the working line for a continuous, running closure. The adjacent parallel cuts serve only as landmarks and occasional staging areas; they are not incorporated into the main repair. From the first moments, the line under active management already shows evidence of prior work: a handful of earlier throws sit in the mid‑portion, tails are visible, and the edges in that region lie neatly approximated. The operator builds on this foundation by methodically advancing the running suture along the same slit, interspersing needle passage with precise tensioning, periodic locking/anchoring throws, and tidy trimming at natural pauses.

At the outset, the field presents with the line appearing slightly offset in the frame, with several midline stitches already seated. The left hand controls the needle driver, the right hand holds Adson pickups, and the first action sequence sets the tone: the needle is gripped about two‑thirds from the tip, oriented nearly perpendicular to the pad, and driven in a controlled arc across the incision. The right‑hand forceps stabilize and evert the edge to expose the dermal margin, then assist with retrieval and passage on the far side. The suture is drawn through smoothly, with the right hand managing the free limb so it doesn’t catch on prior loops. The stitch settles adjacent to earlier ones, continuing the same central line.

The next segment shows a purposeful pause to reset. With both hands briefly off the wound, the operator organizes the strand, reloads the needle off to the inferior edge of the field, and returns to the midline. The needle remains mounted in the driver at the proximal third, curve presented perpendicular to tissue—ready to resume. Without taking a bite yet, the operator tests alignment against the wound and uses the forceps to gently lift the near edge. No new pass is completed in these moments; it’s a clean setup for the next advance.

With the setup complete, the operator resumes active placement along the same slit. Working toward the lower half of the wound, the left‑hand driver re‑grips the needle as needed mid‑arc to follow the curvature, while the right hand alternates between presenting tissue and retrieving the needle tip as it emerges. Bites are taken a few millimeters from the edge, symmetric in depth and offset across the gap. Each pass is accompanied by deliberate tensioning: the free strand is drawn laterally to snug the loop, then raised slightly to seat it without strangulation. In one sequence the operator pauses to anchor the run—forming instrument throws directly over the central wound—using the needle driver as a tying instrument. The driver passes through the loop and sweeps laterally, seating the throw squarely over the incision; the line is locked without taking a new bite. The needle is then reloaded off to the lower edge to prepare for the next pass.

A brief interlude follows in which the operator tests needle angle and tactile feel on an adjacent, untouched practice cut. The left hand presents the driver and the right hand holds pickups, simulating edge eversion and bite alignment on that separate slit. No progress on the central closure occurs during this aside, and the session returns immediately to the true work of the case: the in‑progress running line on the middle wound.

Back on the primary incision, the operator demonstrates a tight interplay between needle handling and tissue control. Near the upper‑mid segment, the needle is grasped on its posterior third and steered across the wound while the right‑hand forceps deftly evert the exit side. After passage, the needle is regripped with the driver to complete the traverse, and the suture loop is managed above the slit to avoid tangles with prior throws. The edges coapt cleanly under gentle traction. A few moments later, the driver continues from the superior‑left approach, guiding the needle perpendicular to the surface for the next pass lower down. Again, the right hand steadies the tissue and briefly manages the free suture limb off to the side, then reengages for retrieval.

Periodic preparations punctuate the rhythm of needle passage. In one stretch, the operator briefly repositions instruments away from the wound to organize slack and stage a cutting tool before returning to the midline. In another, attention appears to stray to the leftmost slit for a momentary demonstration of needle positioning—grasping the dermal edge with forceps while aligning the needle tip at a proper bite distance. But no stitch is completed there, and the main closure proceeds uninterrupted on the central wound. Throughout these interludes, the integrity of the running line is maintained: the central incision remains the only site that receives new bites, locking throws, and final tail management.

The mid‑procedure segments highlight both continuity of technique and deliberate consolidation. After several additional passes (with clear left‑hand driver/right‑hand pickups choreography), the operator secures a knot over the left end of a segment on the midline incision and introduces scissors to trim the tails, leaving short ends. Elsewhere along the line, new bites are placed from right to left and left to right as needed to maintain spacing and alignment, always with forceps‑assisted eversion. The driver frequently releases and re‑grasps mid‑curve to follow the needle’s arc; the forceps alternately lift each edge to present reliable entry and exit points. The wound edges are never crushed; pickups are used sparingly and precisely.

In several sequences, the operator shows a preference for instrument ties over hand ties to secure a locking throw within the continuous strand. These are executed directly over the incision: the driver captures the loop, draws it laterally, and then squarely seats the throw before advancing the run. In other sequences, no knot is formed—only smooth passage, pull‑through, and tensioning to lay the next segment of the continuous closure. Between passes, the driver often hovers just superior‑left of the incision while the right hand pulls the standing part laterally to remove slack. The suture line advances steadily, and the previously open segments narrow as each new pass is placed and tensioned.

As the closure approaches the superior half, the operator continues with the same disciplined technique. Bites are symmetric and close to the preceding loop, preserving cosmetic alignment and eversion. The left hand retains primary control of the needle driver, while the right hand alternates between tissue control and suture management. In one stretch, the needle is reloaded with attention to orientation—grasp at the proximal third, curve perpendicular—before taking the next bite across the wound. In another, the driver is used to “park” the needle safely while instrument throws are formed to lock the line at the center of the wound; the needle is not driven during these tying moments. The throws are coaxed down carefully to land directly on the incision rather than off to one side.

Several mid‑to‑late phases emphasize consolidation rather than advancement. The operator tightens the existing continuous line, adjusts the lay of loops, and then trims excess tails. During these intervals, the needle may rest parked off to the right while forceps work over the central slit to smooth tension distribution. Scissors come in from the left, make a precise cut near a knot or tail, and withdraw. This tidying work brings the earlier segments into uniform alignment without creating new punctures. When active passes resume, the same opposing hand positions return—driver on the left, pickups on the right—meeting over the slit for entry, retrieval, and controlled pull‑through.

Near the top third of the incision, the operator moves briskly yet precisely. The needle is regripped as needed; the right‑hand forceps lift the dermal edge to keep the bite perpendicular and full‑thickness without excess depth. The strand is drawn across and tensioned to seat the throw flush with its neighbors. A few frames later, the terminal end of the run is addressed at the superior wound edge. Here, the driver controls the needle but does not drive it; instead, instrument throws secure a terminal knot. The right hand alternates between holding the free strand and introducing scissors to trim the tail. This finishing step is executed close to the superior 1–2 cm of the incision, and care is taken not to disturb the approximation already achieved.

After this top‑end consolidation, the work shifts slightly in frame while maintaining focus on the same wound. The right hand now presents the needle driver more centrally, with the left hand using forceps for tissue control. Additional stitches are added along the same incision toward the lower end, reflecting continued advancement distally. As before, forceps gently evert the edge to expose bite sites; the needle is driven with the curve perpendicular, retrieved, and the suture is tightened. Instrument ties again secure the segment when needed, followed by trimming before moving forward.

Late in the sequence, there are extended pauses where no active needle passage occurs. In one such interval, no hands are on the field and only a pair of scissors is visible to the right of the pad. The central incision is seen with multiple sutures in place; the lateral slits remain open and untouched. In another moment, a right hand appears at the lower‑right near the scissors without contacting the wound—likely arranging instruments in preparation for a next step or cleanup. The central wound line appears largely unchanged across these frames, indicating a brief inter‑step pause rather than an active maneuver. In the final glimpse, a loose curved needle with attached suture lies inferior to the incision, with scissors resting lateral‑right. The midline slit—especially its superior and mid segments—shows good approximation with several throws and knot tails visible. Distally, a small segment may remain to be addressed, but no new pass is taken in those last stills.

Across the entire session, hand roles and spatial relationships are consistent and deliberate:

- The left hand most often holds the needle driver, stationed just left and slightly superior to the incision, with the jaws controlling the needle around its proximal third. The driver angles the needle perpendicular to the pad for predictable arcs and re‑grips when necessary to follow the curvature across the dermis.

- The right hand predominantly manages the Adson/tissue forceps, lifting and everting edges immediately adjacent to the entry and exit points. It also manages the free suture limb—pulling laterally to clear slack—and intermittently introduces scissors to cut tails after securing throws.

- During tying segments within the continuous run, the driver is repurposed as a tying instrument. The driver passes through the loop, sweeps laterally, and seats each throw squarely over the incision, ensuring the knot lands precisely on the centerline. In those moments, the needle is often “parked” safely on the suture rather than being driven through tissue.

- Instruments consistently straddle the wound, opposing each other across the slit. The tools converge over the incision for entry and retrieval, then separate laterally for pull‑through and tensioning. Movements are tight to the wound—only a few millimeters off the edge—keeping the field controlled and minimizing unhelpful slack.

- When a bite is planned, the forceps briefly present the near edge to ensure eversion and to protect the tissue from crush. Depth and offset of bites remain symmetric across the gap, and each pass is seated close to, but not overlapping, its predecessor.

Technique remains consistent: a running, continuous closure along the same midline incision, advanced in measured increments, periodically anchored with instrument throws, and tidied by trimming tails at appropriate junctures. Even when the camera framing shifts or the operator briefly rehearses a maneuver on an adjacent slit, the only wound that is actually closed, locked, and trimmed is the central one. Where moments without hands or instruments appear, they function as pauses between passes and tying steps, not as breaks in technique.

By the end, the midline wound exhibits a series of neatly spaced throws along its length with the edges largely apposed—especially in the superior and middle sections—consistent with a well‑executed running closure on a training pad. The suture lay is orderly, several knot tails are trimmed short, and the line has been locked at intervals using instrument ties seated directly over the incision. Scissors rest to the right, and a needle with attached strand sits below the pad in a parked position. The lateral parallel slits, visible at various times as landmarks or brief demonstration sites, remain open and unworked. The overall impression is of a careful, methodical running repair whose progression, consolidation, and finishing steps have been executed with consistent hand positioning, reliable needle control, and attention to edge eversion and symmetry. Where brief pauses or off‑field arrangements occur, they serve only to set up the next controlled advance along the same suture line. The final stills show a largely closed central incision with good approximation and organized suture management, awaiting either a final distal pass or simply representing the end of the current exercise with instruments at rest.
