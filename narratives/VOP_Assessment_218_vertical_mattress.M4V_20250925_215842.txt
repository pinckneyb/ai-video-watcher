COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The case begins with the operator identifying and engaging a short, superficial skin defect located in the upper third of the practice pad, centered near the midline. From the outset the working wound is presented as a short transverse/rectangular defect with premarked entry points and previously placed sutures inferior to the current working site; the operator systematically advances a series of interrupted skin closures along this same superior-central incision throughout the session.

Initial approach and needle delivery
At the start the operator positions both hands close to the wound with tight coordination between a needle-holder in the dominant hand and toothed tissue forceps in the nondominant hand. The needle is a curved, swaged needle grasped in the needle driver roughly at the mid‑shaft rather than at the very tip. The nondominant forceps tents and steadies the near edge while the needle driver drives the needle through the far edge in a controlled arc. Needle passes are deliberately shallow-to-full thickness through the simulated dermis and are placed close to the wound margin to create slight eversion of the edges as the bites are taken. The instrument tips approach the incision from opposite sides and cross slightly over the wound during each pass; the hands remain approximately 1–4 cm apart and operate in a compact, coordinated fashion.

Sequential interrupted placement and early knot work
After the first bite is completed the suture is externalized and managed immediately. The operator advances additional interrupted stitches adjacent to the initial bite, working from the superior-most end of the incision and progressing inferiorly. Each stitch shows the same basic choreography: the nondominant toothed forceps grasps and everts the near edge, the dominant needle driver rotates the curved needle through the opposite edge with a smooth rotational movement, the suture limb is pulled through, and tension is applied to appose the edges. In many segments the operator holds the needle near the body of the curvature to achieve stable control over trajectory rather than grasping the delicate tip.

Knotting technique and suture tail management are handled with a combination of instrument and hand maneuvers. The operator commonly forms instrument-tied throws using the driver and opposing forceps or hemostat; ties are advanced and secured with small, controlled alternating motions. Scissors or a hemostat are introduced intermittently to cut suture tails after the knot has been secured. Throughout these steps the left hand alternates between stabilizing tissue, holding the suture loop to orient the knot, and taking the scissors to trim excess tail. Several frames show purposeful re-repositioning of the needle in the driver before completing a throw, indicating attention to knot security and suture alignment.

Progression of the closure and variations in bite depth
As the procedure unfolds, the operator repeats the same pattern of needle passage, tissue stabilization, knot formation, and trimming along the same superior central incision. Bites are consistently placed close to the wound edge with slight eversion intended to achieve good epidermal apposition once tied. Occasionally the operator takes a slightly more superficial bite, and in other passes there is evidence of a deeper, full-thickness dermal engagement of the synthetic pad — the latter tends to occur when additional purchase is desired to bring the wound edges into crisp alignment.

At times the trajectory or exact depth of the needle tip is partially obscured by instrument tips or the angle of view, but the overall pattern is unmistakable: successive interrupted sutures are being placed and secured to close the same short transverse defect. In several sequences the operator repositions the needle in the driver toward the midshaft to allow reliable handling and to prepare for the next throw, a consistent habit that runs through the case.

Instrument choreography and hand position evolution
Hand positions evolve subtly but predictably as the closure progresses. Early on, both hands sit close and low over the pad (~1–3 cm), with the nondominant hand generally occupying the viewer’s left and the dominant hand approaching from the right. The nondominant forceps serve as the stabilizer: presenting and everting the near edge, providing countertraction, and occasionally holding the suture loop during tying. The dominant hand consistently controls the needle driver, delivering the needle in an arc and then converting to knot formation or suture tail manipulation.

As the procedure continues there are moments when one hand reaches laterally to pick up scissors, a hemostat, or to retrieve instruments from the tray; in these moments the assisting hand holds the wound edges and existing sutures stable while the dominant hand prepares the next step. When tying, both hands cluster once again directly over the incision with the driver and forceps meeting above the wound to complete instrument ties. Toward the end of the sequence the operator intermittently withdraws hands to the left or right margins of the platform to fetch or adjust instruments, then returns to the superior-central wound for final knot advancement and tail trimming.

Technique consistency and occasional deviations
Throughout the session the technique remains largely consistent: instrument-tied interrupted sutures with the needle grasped near the midshaft and bites placed to yield slight eversion. This pattern is repeated along the same wound, stitch after stitch. There are, however, brief periods where the operator’s actions focus on knot tightening, suture management, or tail trimming rather than fresh needle passes; during these intervals instruments may rest on the tray or hands move away from the wound. A small number of frames show the operator manipulating suture material or preparing to add another stitch without an immediate visible re-pass of the needle — these are part of the normal workflow of knot sequencing and instrument exchanges.

In several frames the wound edges are approximated and maintained without active needle passage; the operator adjusts suture tails, repositions knots, and trims excess—the expected finishing steps that culminate in a tidy closure. There are also occasional references in the visual log to other nearby incisions on the pad (parallel or midline defects) and to continuous suture work elsewhere on the pad; these observations reflect the training model’s multiple lesions and instrument repositioning, yet the operator repeatedly returns to and continues the top, superior-central transverse incision repair.

Spatial relationships and coordinated motion
The spatial relationships between hands and instruments are tightly conserved. The nondominant hand consistently frames the near wound edge and the dominant hand’s driver arcs the needle across the gap. Tips converge directly over the bite site and alternate on successive passes to reduce tissue trauma and to produce even apposition. When cutting, the scissors are introduced from the lateral aspect and the dominant hand momentarily shifts from needle control to cutting and trimming. Throughout the procedure both hands remain within a narrow working envelope — usually within a few centimeters of the incision — which allows precise, micro-motions during needle rotation, tie advancement, and tail management.

Progress toward completion and final maneuvers
As the operator advances the sequence, previously placed stitches occupy the inferior aspect of the incision; new passes are placed at the superior aspect progressing toward them until the defect is closed. The operator secures each knot with instrument ties, advances the knot snugly to maintain slight eversion, and trims tails with short scissors cuts. Near the end the operator performs final adjustments: smoothing knots, re-approximating any mildly everted segments, and making sure suture tails are tidy and not introducing tension that could invert or blanch the tissue.

Final appearance and wound edge approximation
In the concluding frames the incision exhibits several secured interrupted sutures along its length. The wound edges are well-approximated with minor localized eversion at the stitch points, consistent with the placement technique and the chosen bite depth. Instrument manipulation has ceased and the hands withdraw from the immediate field, leaving the repaired superior-central incision with tidy knots and trimmed tails. At the very end there are frames showing sutures already tied and trimmed, instruments resting near the pad, and the operator making small checks to ensure the closure is smooth.

Observations about procedural clarity and limitations
Throughout the procedure the surgeon demonstrates deliberate, consistent technique: midshaft needle grasp, controlled needle arcs, tissue stabilization with toothed forceps, instrument ties, and careful suture tail management. A small number of frames provided partial visual obstruction of the needle tip or depth of bite, and the training pad includes multiple nearby incision sites that occasionally confound a strict linear narrative. Nonetheless, the working sequence returns repeatedly to the same superior-central transverse incision and completes its closure through a series of instrument-tied interrupted stitches, with intermittent knot advancement and tail trimming that culminate in a neatly approximated wound.

Summary
In summary, the operator methodically closes the top, superior-central transverse incision along the pad by placing sequential interrupted stitches. Each stitch follows a consistent pattern: nondominant forceps elevate and evert the near edge, the dominant needle driver advances the curved needle through the opposite edge while grasped at mid‑shaft, the suture is pulled through and secured by instrument-tied throws, and the tails are trimmed. Hand positions remain concentrated and coordinated directly over the wound, with occasional lateral movements to exchange instruments. The procedure concludes with the incision approximated along its length, slightly everted at the stitch sites, with secure knots and short, trimmed tails.
