COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single left-sided skin defect on the training pad — a short vertical-to-curved incision in the upper‑left quadrant of the model — that is closed in a stepwise fashion with individual interrupted sutures. From the first frames through the final ones the operator repeatedly returns to that same left-side wound, advancing a single line of closure from one end toward the other and finishing each bite with secure knots and trimmed tails. Over the course of the recording the suturing proceeds through repeated cycles of tissue control, needle presentation, passage through both wound margins, suture tensioning/knot tying, and cutting, with only occasional short pauses to organize suture tails or reposition instruments.

Initial approach and setup (0.0–74.0 s)
The operator begins at the superior portion of the left incision. Both hands come to rest immediately over the defect; one hand carries fine toothed or Adson‑style tissue forceps while the other carries a needle driver/holder. Early needle grips are commonly at the distal-third or mid‑shaft of the curved, swaged needle, with the curvature oriented to pass from the near edge toward the far edge in a controlled arc. The non‑needle hand consistently elevates and aligns the superior wound margin with fine forceps to provide counter‑traction and a receiving surface for the needle. Bites are small, deliberate, and placed close to the wound edge; the operator demonstrates light, atraumatic handling of the synthetic dermal layer and achieves slight outward eversion of the edges to promote epidermal apposition once the suture is tightened.

Establishing the stitch rhythm (75.0–179.0 s)
As the sequence continues, the operator establishes a steady pattern of interrupted stitches along the left incision. The needle driver is frequently reoriented between passes and the needle tip is sometimes adjusted with the tissue forceps to ensure precise entry. Grips on the needle alternate between near‑swage, mid‑shaft, and distal‑third positions depending on the arc and moment of passage; this variability reflects the routine re‑grasping used to control the needle’s curvature for small, perpendicular-to‑oblique bites. Both hands remain tightly coordinated, typically 1–4 cm apart, with the instrument delivering the needle approaching from a lateral or superior angle while the opposing forceps provide counter‑traction medially. The operator consistently draws full‑thickness dermal bites through the synthetic skin — enough depth to approximate dermis without excess tissue puckering — and pulls the suture through to form a loop in preparation for knotting.

Progression along the line (180.0–299.0 s)
The closure progresses sequentially along the left line: bites are added adjacent to previously placed interrupted stitches and the work migrates inferiorly/medially along the same defect. During this phase the operator sometimes momentarily secures the free suture tail with a secondary clamp positioned inferior to the wound while the next bite is taken, enabling continuous management of multiple tails and preventing entanglement. Needle presentation remains consistent: curved needles are rotated through controlled arcs, and the needle driver often grasps the shaft near the hinge or mid‑body to stabilize the arc and withdraw the needle smoothly after passage. The non‑dominant hand alternates between fine forceps and gloved fingers to steady tissue, hold suture strands, and guide loops for subsequent knot formation. The operator adopts short, economical motions and maintains instrument tips converging at the bite site to optimize accuracy in this compact working zone.

Knot tying, tensioning, and intermediate finishing (300.0–419.0 s)
Interspersed with new passes the operator performs knot tying and suture trimming at the proximal portions of previously placed bites. The needle driver or a held clamp is used as a fixed anchor above the incision while the opposing hand brings a scissors or fine instrument into the field to cut suture tails or perform final tightening. During knot formation the left/right handed roles shift at times (either hand may hold the needle driver or the receiving instrument depending on the task), but both remain adjacent to the wound and coordinate to maintain consistent suture tension and edge apposition. Edge eversion remains modest and controlled; no wide tissue eversion or deep undermining is undertaken. The operator’s technique for securing knots is methodical: loops are pulled snug to approximate epidermal margins and excess tails are trimmed close to the knot, leaving short ends that lie flush with the closure.

Continued placement and suture management (420.0–539.0 s)
Work resumes with additional interrupted stitches placed further along the same left incision. The pattern of approach is unchanged: the needle driver presents the curved needle at a shallow-to-perpendicular angle, the forceps lift and evert the opposing edge, and a full‑thickness dermal bite is taken and pulled through. The operator occasionally uses fingertip control rather than forceps to manage suture tails, indicating confidence in direct suture handling and a desire to minimize instrument exchanges. Hands remain within a tight working envelope (often less than 5 cm separation), which keeps instrument tips convergent and permits precise needle arcs. Several frames show the operator using a vertical orientation of the needle driver at the superior end of the incision to withdraw and tension the suture while the opposite hand approaches laterally to cut and organize tails — the familiar finish for each interrupted bite before moving on to the next.

Final passes and completion (540.0–605.0 s)
In the closing stages the operator places the remaining interrupted stitches toward the superior or midbody segments of the same left wound, then proceeds to finalize and trim the last knots. Needle handling in these last frames is steady: the needle is grasped near the swage or mid‑shaft for fine control, passed through the opposing margin in short controlled arcs, the suture pulled taut to align the epidermal edges, a secure knot tied, and the tail trimmed. Occasionally a long needle holder remains fixed in place to steady the suture loop while the opposite hand uses scissors or a second clamp to finish the knot and cut the tail. Throughout these final steps the wound edges remain well approximated with only minimal eversion and no obvious gapping.

Technique characteristics and evolution
Throughout the case the surgeon applies a consistent interrupted suturing technique tailored to superficial skin closure on synthetic tissue. The hallmarks are:

- Repetitive use of a curved, swaged needle with controlled arc passes to capture both margins in a full‑thickness dermal bite.
- Alternating needle grips (distal third, mid‑shaft, near‑swage) to manage needle trajectory depending on the bite location and required control.
- Routine opposing use of fine toothed/Adson-style forceps to lift and align the near edge while the needle driver delivers the needle from the lateral or superior side.
- Modest edge eversion produced deliberately at each bite to favor epidermal coaptation after tying.
- Consistent knot‑tying technique and trimming of suture tails following each pass to prevent suture entanglement as the line advances.

Hand positions and instrument relationships
Hands remain close to the line from start to finish. Early and mid procedural stages show the needle driver and forceps converging directly over the bite site with instrument tips 1–4 cm apart; this tight working envelope is maintained for accurate needle control. The orientation of the needle driver varies — sometimes the left hand supplies the driver and the right hand the forceps, and on other passes the dominant hand alternates — but the functional choreography is stable: one instrument presents or receives the needle while the other stabilizes tissue and suture. When tying and cutting occur the needle driver is often held vertically over the incision to anchor the suture and the opposite hand brings scissors or a second clamp in from the lateral side to complete knot security and tail trimming. There are brief phases where fingertip management replaces forceps for suture handling, reflecting efficient suture organization in a confined space.

Consistency and deviations
The technique remains essentially consistent from the first pass to the last. Small deviations — regrasping the needle at different shaft positions, momentary use of fingers instead of forceps, and the occasional use of a secondary clamp to hold suture tails — are functional adaptations to the local geometry of the wound and the need to maintain an orderly suture line. A few frames show brief activity near other incisions on the pad or handling of existing stitch tails, but these are limited to suture management and trimming; no other defect is actively re‑approximated or re‑sutured. The operator preserves the same interrupted pattern and attention to eversion across the entire left wound.

Final appearance
At the conclusion of the recording the left incision is uniformly approximated by a closely spaced row of interrupted sutures. Each bite shows consistent dermal purchase and gentle eversion of the epidermal margins; knots are tightened to effect edge coaptation and tails have been trimmed short. The wound demonstrates even apposition along its length with no visible gaping, overt puckering, or excessive tension. Instrumentation has been withdrawn from active needle passage and the last suture tails organized or trimmed, leaving the closure clean and stable on the synthetic pad.

Overall, the operator performed a methodical interrupted‑suture closure of the left‑side incision: precise needle control with repeated arc passes, coordinated use of fine forceps for tissue alignment, routine knot securing and tail trimming, and consistent maintenance of close instrument spatial relationships to preserve accuracy throughout the line of closure.
