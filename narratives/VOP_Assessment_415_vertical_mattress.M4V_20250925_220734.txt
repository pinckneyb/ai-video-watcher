COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video documents a methodical closure of a single linear skin defect located at the viewer’s far left/lateral margin of the silicone practice pad. From the very first frames through to the final stills the operator returns again and again to that left-most vertical incision, progressively placing and securing a series of superficial interrupted stitches to bring the dermal edges into approximation. The work is performed with a conventional two‑handed technique throughout: one instrument presents and stabilizes the tissue edge while the other holds and drives a curved suture needle. Over the course of the recording the approach is steady and repetitive, with small, deliberate adjustments in grip and approach angle to optimize needle purchase, edge eversion, and knot management.

Initial approach and first passes (0–44 s)
At the outset the incision is identified as a shallow, longitudinal slit roughly 2–3 cm long in the simulated epidermis. A loose tail from an earlier stitch is visible near the wound center, signalling the site is already in mid‑closure. The operator adopts an opposing‑hands configuration: one hand grips fine toothed forceps to elevate and tent the near wound edge while the other holds a needle driver with a curved needle secured roughly at the mid‑body. Needle orientation is planned so the tip will enter perpendicular or slightly oblique to the wound margin. With short, controlled rotations of the driver, the needle is advanced through the near edge and carried across the defect. The forceps consistently present the opposite edge by lifting and everting it to ensure superficial dermal purchase and to prevent inversion.

Hands remain close to the wound (a working distance of a few centimeters), the needle driver generally positioned superior or medial to the incision while the forceps approach from lateral or inferior angles depending on the immediate bite location. The operator regrips the needle when necessary (mid‑shaft to distal‑third grasp), allowing full arcs of needle travel and controlled withdrawal of the suture through the tissue. After each pass the suture is pulled through, tensioned, and the team prepares for knot tying or the next bite.

Sequential interrupted placement and refinement (45–179 s)
Through the next minute and a half the left incision receives sequential interrupted sutures placed methodically along its length and toward its superior end. The dominant pattern is consistent: the tissue pickup with forceps to evert and stabilize the epidermal margin, and the needle driver rotating the curved needle through full‑thickness of the synthetic dermis in near‑perpendicular bites. Bite depth is mostly superficial to mid‑dermal, appropriate to the model used, and avoids deep, bulky purchase.

Hand roles are largely stable but adaptable. In many passes the right hand assumes the needle‑driving role while the left presents tissue with forceps; in other frames the left hand holds the driver and the right holds the forceps, indicating the operator alternates hands to optimize approach angle at different segments of the slit. When working at the superior corner of the incision the driver is often oriented downward toward the apex to place precise corner bites; when working mid‑length the approach is more orthogonal. Instrument tips typically occupy adjacent positions across the open wound, within 1–4 cm of one another, allowing fast instrument exchange and tight control of needle trajectory.

Needle handling is deliberate: the needle is grasped at slightly different shaft positions depending on the required curvature and arc. Regrips are frequent—often to change the fulcrum or to get a better tip purchase for a perpendicular entry. The operator frequently threads, pulls, and momentarily tensions the suture to evaluate edge apposition before committing to knot tying. Edges are consistently brought into mild eversion as stitches are seated, an intentional maneuver evident on multiple bites where the skin simulant flares slightly upward at the bite sites.

Knot management, trimming, and intermittent adjustments (90–225 s)
As stitches accumulate along the incision, the operator begins to manage knots and suture tails. Several frames show manipulation of an already‑passed loop and free tail, with one hand stabilizing the tissue and the other operating the driver or scissors to tighten or trim. Knot‑tying technique is conventional — instrument‑assisted throws secured with forceps‑controlled knot placement. The operator tends to hold the closed knot in position while trimming tails, leaving short tails protruding, and maintaining each knot so the adjacent next bite can be placed without distortion of the tissue alignment.

Throughout this phase there is careful maintenance of the previously placed stitches: the forceps will often re‑position or lift adjacent sutures to prevent entanglement and to allow accurate spacing. Instrument parking is visible in some frames — the needle driver left cranial to the incision between passes while forceps handle tissue — before the driver returns to re‑engage the needle for the next bite.

Mid‑procedure stability and repeated passes (240–299 s)
The operator continues sequential placement of interrupted sutures, working progressively toward remaining gaps on the slit. The working geometry remains tightly coordinated: the needle driver typically approaches from a left or superior vector while the forceps oppose from right or inferior. Bite angles are controlled, and the needle is often grasped a bit more proximal to the swage when a longer, controlled arc is required near a corner. Tissue handling continues to be atraumatic: fine forceps and small bites maintain approximation without puckering.

At times the operator pauses between passes. Several frames show instruments at the pad periphery and hands out of the frame; tied sutures remain along the slit with excess tails draping across the pad. These moments are interspersed with active passes where the needle is advanced, drawn through, and the next knot prepared. The operator repeatedly repositions the needle driver to regain optimal control and sometimes flips the needle within the driver for a better exit angle.

Periods with visual ambiguity elsewhere on the pad (300–329, 315–329, 330–344 s)
Midway through the recording there are sequences that visually emphasize the central slit on the pad: a continuous suture line running down the central incision appears in several stills with free tails trailing inferiorly. Importantly, during those segments no hands or instruments are present over that central site; the running strand is static and not actively manipulated. The instrument absence and lack of tissue traction make it clear the central repair, while visible, is not the focus of current activity. These frames are pausing interludes where the operator either temporarily moved away from the left slit or the camera captured moments between passes. Instruments and suture material are seen lying idle at the pad margins during these pauses.

Renewed work on the lateral slit and final completion (330–348 s)
Following the static central frames the operator returns attention to the lateral slit. In the final series of frames the left-most incision is shown with multiple interrupted sutures already tied along its length, and the operator completes the remaining bites and finalizes knot security. The last images show five tied interrupted stitches clustered along the slit with tails extending outward; edges are largely approximated with slight eversion at several bites, consistent with earlier placement technique. At the end some instruments rest idle at the pad periphery and no hands are visible — the closure appears complete with the remaining suture tails left intact.

Throughout the entire sequence the operator adheres to a conservative, reproducible interrupted suture technique: opposing hands, controlled perpendicular-to-oblique needle bites, eversion of edges via gentle forceps traction, mid‑shaft needle grips when a full arc is needed, and frequent regrips to achieve optimal bite orientation. Technique consistency is high: the same pattern is repeated for each stitch, though minor adjustments in grip or approach angle are used to manage corners or previously placed stitches. The hands and instruments remain in close spatial relationship to the wound for maximal control, typically within a few centimeters of the incision, alternating positions as required to access different segments.

Final appearance and tissue alignment
By the end of the recording the lateral incision is closed with a sequence of securely tied interrupted sutures. The wound edges lie in close apposition with mild eversion at several bites, and residual suture tails remain on the surface of the pad. The surrounding synthetic skin is undisturbed beyond the immediate repair zone. Other parallel incisions on the pad retain previously placed sutures (including a continuous central strand visible during static frames), but these are not actively manipulated in the moments captured when hands are absent. The overall closure demonstrates careful, controlled superficial skin suturing appropriate to a practice setting: precise needle control, consistent edge eversion, and methodical knot management result in a neat row of interrupted stitches approximating the wound along the left lateral slit.
