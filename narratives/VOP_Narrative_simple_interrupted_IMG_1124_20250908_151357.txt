COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on the center wound. With the forceps in the left hand presenting the inferior margin, the right hand drives a curved needle perpendicular to the skin to take a symmetric bite across the gap. The thread arcs cleanly across as the needle is guided through the far edge; no knot is yet tied in this first pass.

There is a brief return to a previously placed central stitch to snug a throw, then the focus shifts to the left‑side slit. At its lower half, the left hand uses Adson forceps to evert the near edge while the right hand, with the needle driver, advances a balanced bite through one side and out the other. The driver then releases and regrips the standing end to begin an instrument tie; the left hand transitions from forceps to managing the free tail to set the initial throws.

Attention moves back to the center incision to secure the initial stitch there. The needle is already through; the right hand uses the driver to wind and grasp the tail, forming sequential square throws while the left hand maintains counter‑tension. The knot is seated directly over the wound, approximating the edges without gapping.

Staying on the central wound, a second stitch is placed just superior to the first. The forceps in the left hand lift the left lip to ensure eversion as the right hand enters on the right edge and follows the arc across. The tip is received with the forceps, and the suture is pulled through to complete passage; tying will follow.

The second central stitch is then secured. The needle remains parked while the right hand uses the driver to perform instrument ties. The left hand keeps gentle purchase on the left edge to steady and evert as needed, then shifts to manage the tail. Successive throws are tightened in opposing directions to square and set the knot, bringing the wound edges together neatly.

Work returns to the left incision. Two interrupted stitches are already present along this line; a third has been passed and is being tied. The right hand, positioned over the slit, alternates between looping and grasping the tail with the driver. The left hand, slightly inferior‑left to the wound, tensions the free end so each throw seats flat. By the end of this sequence, the third stitch on the left slit is secured; the longer right‑side cut remains untouched.

The field shifts again to the center incision, where two stitches are in place. A new stitch is added superior to them: the needle, grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, is driven through the right wound edge and guided across to the left. The forceps assist emergence and suture pull‑through, preserving perpendicular entry and exit for even bite depth.

That new central stitch is tied and finished. The left hand intermittently grasps the near dermal edge to maintain eversion while the right hand forms instrument‑tie loops directly over the wound, seats the knot between the existing stitches, and then switches to scissors to trim the tails. This brings the central line to three evenly spaced interrupted sutures.

Knot work continues over the same central incision. With three knots visible, the right hand uses the needle driver to loop and capture the tail while the left hand maintains counter‑tension, adding another secured stitch just proximal to the others. The line now shows four simple‑interrupted sutures spanning the wound; no cutting is performed in this interval.

The sequence closes with final grooming over the central wound. The left hand stabilizes each knot while the right hand approaches from the superior‑right with suture scissors, tips aimed toward the tails for precise trimming. No new bites are taken, the wound edges remain well‑approximated, and the adjacent longer practice slits are left undisturbed throughout.

Across the procedure, the pattern is consistent: bites are taken perpendicular to the wound with the needle grasped mid‑to‑distal on the curve; the left hand’s forceps are used during needle passage to evert and control, then released to manage the suture tail during tying. Instrument ties are formed with the driver sweeping across the line and the hands pulling in opposite directions to square each throw. When cutting, the scissors approach from the right while the left hand retracts slightly to protect tissue, maintaining clear coordination and spacing over the working incision.
