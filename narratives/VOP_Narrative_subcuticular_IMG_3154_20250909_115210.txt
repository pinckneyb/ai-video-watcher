COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
Orientation and setup
The field is a multi‑incision skin‑suturing pad with three vertical cuts: a central midline laceration that already bears several simple‑interrupted stitches, a short vertical slit in the upper‑left quadrant close to the left edge fixation pin, and a longer vertical cut on the right that remains untouched throughout. The work that follows is devoted to closing the short slit on the left. The central row is glimpsed at a few points but is not part of the closure being advanced and does not enter the stitch count for the left slit.

0.0s–14.0s: First bites begin at the left slit’s superior third
The operator establishes a consistent body and instrument orientation that persists for most of the case: the left hand holds the needle driver lateral to the left slit; the right hand uses Adson/tissue forceps to present tissue. The target is the short vertical slit on the left; the forceps gently evert and stabilize the right margin of this slit, exposing dermis 3–4 mm from the edge for an accurate bite. The needle is grasped in the driver at about the proximal-to-mid third—approximately two‑thirds of the way from the tip—and oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. It is driven from the near/right edge toward the left, consistent with the beginning of a simple interrupted stitch at the superior third of this short incision. Depth is partial‑thickness through synthetic epidermis/dermis, with the forceps keeping the edge everted; no knot tying occurs in this first sequence. The central midline row with multiple completed simple‑interrupted sutures is visible but not manipulated.

15.0s–29.0s: Continued setup for the first pass on the same left slit
Still working on the same small left slit, the left‑hand needle driver sits just lateral and slightly inferior to the wound, with its tip aligned to enter the left edge and sweep medially across the slit. The right hand alternates between forceps and managing the free suture strand, hovering superior to the wound to maintain exposure and prevent the thread from catching on the pad. The needle remains clamped about two‑thirds from its tip, axis perpendicular to the skin. The forceps/fingertips lightly evert the edge; no deep tissue is engaged. These frames emphasize controlled presentation and accurate entry rather than completion—no tightening or knot tying is performed yet.

30.0s–44.0s: Transition from a quick midline trim to active needle work on the left slit
At the very start of this segment there is a brief scissor trim over the already‑closed midline row—housekeeping unrelated to the left slit closure. The hands then move to the left slit. The left hand, from the pad’s left side, again drives the curved needle (grasped two‑thirds from the tip, jaws perpendicular to the curve). The right hand’s forceps control the opposite edge, alternating their grasp to sequentially evert each lip. The needle trajectory is set from the far/left edge toward the near/right edge at the lower third of the slit, again maintaining a perpendicular approach. This is consistent with initiating another simple interrupted stitch on the same short slit; there is no knot tying in this interval.

45.0s–59.0s: Brief interlude at the midline row
Attention momentarily shifts to the midline laceration, which already has exactly three completed simple‑interrupted sutures visible. The left hand brings in the needle driver from the left, with the right hand using forceps to evert the inferior left dermal edge, preparing the next stitch in that midline row. Although the needle is positioned to enter at 90°, this is a separate wound and does not change the evolving closure of the short left slit. No new stitch is completed on the left slit during this interlude.

60.0s–74.0s: Back to the left slit—first bite placed and retrieved
The work returns to the left slit. The left‑hand driver sits at the inferior‑lateral quadrant of the wound; the right‑hand forceps alternate between manipulating the needle and lifting the skin edge to evert and control bite depth. The curved needle is grasped two‑thirds from the tip and driven in a controlled arc through the near edge. The tip emerges and is captured for transfer, positioning for the opposite‑edge bite. The stitch is being initiated; no knot is tied in this segment and no completed sutures are yet counted on this slit.

75.0s–89.0s: Left slit—upper third work continues
The same simple interrupted technique is repeated near the superior third. The left hand advances the needle on a near‑perpendicular arc through the near (left) edge; the right‑hand forceps lift and evert the tissue, then stabilize the far edge to guide a symmetric exit. The tissue is tented gently to control depth and spacing. The stitch is in progress with passage toward the far side; tying is not yet performed, and there remain no completed stitches on this slit in these frames.

90.0s–104.0s: Left slit—first bite placed and needle drawn through
The forceps maintain eversion as the left hand places a bite a few millimeters from the superior apex of the slit. After penetration, the right hand seizes the needle with forceps to draw it through, a common technique on small fields to prevent torque on the pad. The pass goes from lateral (left) to medial across the gap. This continues the methodical setup for simple interrupted closure. The central wound remains undisturbed. Still, no completed knot on this slit is visible in this window.

105.0s–119.0s: Left slit—near‑edge bite at the superior end
Focus stays on the same left slit. The left hand holds the driver at the inferior‑left, needle gripped near its mid‑to‑proximal third, tip perpendicular to the skin. The right hand elevates the superior edge, everting dermis to present the entry site. The needle is driven through the near edge at the superior end, aiming across toward the far edge. The far bite is not yet taken in these frames; no knotting is seen, and the left slit still has no completed sutures visible here.

120.0s–134.0s: Left slit—needle traverses both edges
With forceps grasping the far edge to evert and stabilize, the needle now completes its arc across the slit at the superior end, passing through both edges with an even depth and spacing. The wound edges approximate with minimal gapping during needle passage. The stitch is laid down but not yet tied; no completed knots are present on this slit at this time.

135.0s–149.0s: Left slit—another full pass across, no tying yet
The left hand remains lateral with the needle driver; the right hand holds forceps medial to the slit. The curved needle is regrasped and driven in the arc path through one edge and across into the other, maintaining perpendicular entry and consistent bite depth. At moments, the right hand may exchange to a driver to regrasp the needle for controlled exit. The suture is drawn through; again, knot tying is not shown in these frames. No completed sutures are counted on the left slit here.

150.0s–164.0s: Another brief return to the central row
There is a short sequence at the midline wound, where a stitch near the superior end of that row is tightened and secured. Four completed knots are visible along the midline. This is separate from the left slit closure and does not alter the suture count on the left slit.

165.0s–179.0s: Left slit—instrument ties and two knots visible along the slit
Work returns decisively to the left slit. The right hand uses forceps to control the suture tail and guide tension; the left hand alternates between holding the needle and using the driver to grasp the free strand for instrument ties. Throws are executed to seat and secure a knot at the superior end of the incision while maintaining gentle eversion and coaptation of the edges. In these frames, two simple‑interrupted sutures are visible along the left slit—one previously placed inferiorly and a newly tied one superiorly. This marks the first clear moment where completed sutures are visible on this slit.

180.0s–194.0s: Left slit—another pass begun at the superior portion; one knot visible in frame
The operator initiates another simple interrupted stitch at the superior portion of the left slit. The needle is again held about two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the driver jaws, presented to the left (near) edge at the superior end and then passed across. The right‑hand forceps evert and stabilize the near dermal edge. In these frames, one completed stitch is visible at the mid‑portion of the left slit. Given framing, other knots along the slit may be off‑screen; subsequent segments confirm two are present concurrently. No tying is completed in this window.

195.0s–209.0s: Left slit—third pass is initiated with two prior stitches present
The sequence continues at the same short left slit, positioned just medial to the left fixation pin. The left hand alternates between the needle driver and using the thumb to control tension; the right hand holds forceps over the superior end, lifting the wound edge to expose the bite site. The needle, grasped two‑thirds from the tip, is oriented perpendicular to the surface and presented to take another standard simple interrupted bite at the superior end. Two interrupted sutures are already visible along this slit in this view, confirming the count seen earlier. Knot tying for this new pass is not shown here.

210.0s–219.0s: Left slit—final dressing: trimming tails on the upper knot; two sutures visible
The procedure concludes with dressing of the sutures on the left slit. The right hand, entering from the upper right, grasps and tensions the knot/tail of the superior stitch with fine forceps. The left hand arrives from the upper left with scissors, opening the tips and approaching the suture at roughly a 45° angle close to the skin surface to trim the ends cleanly without cutting the knot. No needle holder is present; no new passes are taken. Two interrupted sutures are clearly visible along this left slit, both fully tied. The central midline row and the right‑side slit remain untouched during this final maneuver.

Technique and hand‑position consistency across the case
- The operator consistently uses a simple interrupted technique on the small left slit: perpendicular needle entry approximately 3–4 mm from the margin; smooth, curved passage through near then far dermis; controlled exit with the needle regrasped as needed; and careful edge eversion maintained with Adson/tissue forceps.
- Needle handling remains consistent: the driver grips the curve around two‑thirds from the tip, which maximizes control of the arc and minimizes wobble. The jaws are kept perpendicular to the needle. The left hand nearly always approaches from the lateral/left side of the slit, directing the tip medially.
- The right hand’s role evolves from edge presentation to suture management: early on it lifts and everts the near or far lip as appropriate; at times it reaches across to grasp and draw the needle out to avoid torqueing the pad; during knot tying it tensions the tail to help seat instrument throws.
- Spatial relationships are deliberately maintained: hands oppose each other across the wound; the driver typically remains slightly inferior or lateral to the forceps to preserve a clear line of sight as the needle enters and exits; at the end, scissors approach from the left and forceps counter from the right to stabilize the knot as tails are trimmed flush.
- Tissue handling is gentle throughout: only skin/dermis on the training pad is manipulated; no deep bites or subcutaneous purchase is attempted; eversion is pursued with light pinching and lifting by the forceps to promote accurate edge apposition.

Suture progression on the left slit
The closure proceeds through a series of placements concentrated at the superior half of the left slit with occasional work toward its lower third. From 0.0s through 149.0s, multiple bites are taken and needles are passed across, but no knot tying is shown on the left slit. The first explicit tying on this slit appears at 165.0s–179.0s, where the operator uses instrument ties to secure a stitch at the superior end, and two completed simple‑interrupted sutures are visible along the length—one inferior and one newly secured superior. At 180.0s–194.0s, a new pass is started near the superior portion; only one completed knot is within the camera’s field in those frames, but later views (195.0s–209.0s) again show two sutures present while another bite is initiated at the top. The final sequence (210.0s–219.0s) shows tail trimming at the superior stitch with two tied sutures visible. No third stitch is completed within the captured footage.

How the count evolves, with camera‑framing caveats
- 0.0s–149.0s: No completed sutures are visible on the left slit; all sequences show bites being placed and needles traversing edges without tying.
- 165.0s–179.0s: Two completed sutures are visible along the left slit—one previously placed inferiorly and one just tied superiorly.
- 180.0s–194.0s: One completed knot is visible in frame at mid‑portion, while another stitch is being placed at the superior end; subsequent frames confirm two are present.
- 195.0s–209.0s: Two completed sutures are visible, and another bite is initiated near the top but not tied in this window.
- 210.0s–219.0s: Two completed sutures are visible as the tails of the superior knot are trimmed; no additional sutures are added.

Knot management and final dressing
Knotting is by instrument tie. The driver alternates between grasping the needle and the strand, coordinating with the right hand’s forceps to tension the tail and lay down multiple throws that seat squarely over the incision. The edges remain slightly everted as the knot is cinched. In the final sequence the superior knot’s tails are trimmed close to the surface with scissors angled at roughly 45°, while the forceps stabilize the knot to prevent loosening.

Final state and verification
- By the end of the procedure, the short vertical slit on the left bears two fully tied simple‑interrupted sutures. The edges are approximated with mild, expected puckering near the center from the suture bites, and both knots have been dressed with trimmed tails.
- No additional stitches are added in the concluding frames, and no tightening or tying occurs on the right‑side slit at any time; it remains untouched. The midline row is glimpsed and briefly adjusted earlier, but it is not part of the closure described here.

Mandatory suture count verification
- Final count of completed sutures on the left slit, as seen in the last frames (210.0s–219.0s): 2 completed simple‑interrupted sutures.
- Count progression on the left slit through the video:
  - 0.0s–149.0s: 0 completed sutures (bites and passes only, no tying shown).
  - 165.0s–179.0s: 2 completed sutures visible (one inferior, one newly tied superior).
  - 180.0s–194.0s: 1 completed suture visible in frame while a new pass is taken; later frames confirm 2 are present.
  - 195.0s–209.0s: 2 completed sutures visible; another bite initiated but not tied within this window.
  - 210.0s–219.0s: 2 completed sutures visible while the superior knot’s tails are cut.
- Therefore, the procedure resulted in 2 completed sutures on the targeted left vertical slit.

In summary
The surgeon methodically closes the short left vertical slit with a series of simple interrupted stitches, maintaining perpendicular needle entry, controlled arc passage, and deliberate edge eversion with forceps. Early sequences lay down multiple bites without tying; tying begins later, culminating in two completed knots spaced along the slit. Final dressing trims the superior knot’s tails. The central midline row is seen briefly for housekeeping but does not factor into this closure. The final state shows the left slit secured with exactly two completed simple‑interrupted sutures.
