Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your motion is calm and controlled with a stable working triangle, orthogonal needle driving, and consistently gentle tissue handling. Suture management and knot work are disciplinedâ€”throws are alternated, knots are squared, and tails are trimmed cleanly. Instrument positioning is close to the work with safe needle parking, and overall rhythm is steady.
