COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a single working incision on the right side of the skin practice pad — a straight, superior–inferior oriented slit located slightly lateral of the pad center (the right‑most vertical incision). Over the course of the recording the operator repeatedly returns to that same right‑sided incision and advances the closure, working methodically along the length of the defect with a two‑handed needle‑driver/forceps technique on synthetic skin material.

0–14 s: The recording opens with the right‑most vertical incision exposed and untreated — a full‑length linear slit with open edges and no sutures in place. A gloved right hand enters from the upper‑right quadrant and positions an instrument over the lateral portion of the wound. No needle is visible in these frames and there is no clear approximation or eversion of the wound margins yet. This initial view establishes the target defect and the approach trajectory (superior‑lateral instrument entry), but instrument detail is limited.

15–44 s: The working posture becomes two‑handed and cooperative. By 15–29 s (frames show operations near the right‑side region) two hands are present: one grips a needle driver vertically over the wound while the other manipulates fine toothed forceps at the lateral edge. The needle is grasped near mid‑shaft, driven from superior to inferior and then withdrawn as the operator places a first bite. At 30–44 s the left hand holds a long needle‑driver medial to the incision while the right hand stabilizes the lateral margin with forceps; the driver takes a perpendicular‑to‑oblique approach to place a curved needle through the lateral edge, then the suture is pulled through toward midline. Throughout these early passes the instrument tips remain within a few centimeters of each other, deliberately coordinating needle trajectory and tissue control. Bites are small, superficial, and the operator begins to produce slight eversion as suture material is drawn through and organized.

45–74 s: The operator repeats the same two‑instrument cycle. By 45–59 s the left hand is again medial, holding a needle driver, while the right hand stabilizes laterally and makes controlled passes with a curved needle in shallow arcs through epidermal/dermal layers. At 60–74 s the working site is a small puncture adjacent to the main incision where a suture strand is already present; hand roles alternate between needle driver and scissors in the dominant hand and forceps in the opposite hand, indicating active suture management together with tissue stabilization. Across these frames the pattern is clear: sequential needle passes, pulling of suture material, and preparing the strand for knotting rather than wide retraction or deep layer closure.

75–104 s: The operator continues to take precise dermal bites. In the 75–89 s window a curved needle is advanced through a small circular defect with the needle driver vertical and the forceps providing countertraction; suture is passed and partially seated. From 90–104 s the left hand holds the needle driver more perpendicularly over the incision while the right hand uses Adson‑style forceps to manipulate the suture tail and stabilize the lateral tissue — these frames emphasize tensioning and organizing of a recently placed stitch, and the driver is sometimes used to hold the needle in a static position as the suture tail is managed.

105–149 s: Activity alternates between placement of new stitches and finishing of existing ones. During 105–119 s the operator mainly manipulates a previously passed suture and secures it with instrument control rather than placing a fresh needle pass. At 120–134 s and 135–149 s a needle is again grasped mid‑shaft and used to take controlled perpendicular bites at the wound edge near an existing knot; the forceps guide the receiving edge and the suture is drawn through for seating and subsequent tying. Throughout this period the operator’s hands remain closely opposed (within 1–3 cm), and both instruments cross briefly over the wound during needle transfer and knot manipulation.

150–194 s: The pattern — place a short dermal bite, draw suture through, secure with instrument ties — continues. At 150–164 s the driver holds the needle and then transitions to holding the suture for tying while the opposite forceps readjust. By 165–179 s roles sometimes reverse: the left hand may hold forceps while the right hand controls the driver or scissors as needed, but the typical configuration for most passes is needle driver (left) and forceps (right). In 180–194 s clinicians are working at the apex of a cluster of previously placed interrupted stitches; they take new short bites adjacent to those stitches and pull the suture through, concentrating on edge alignment and slight eversion with minimal tissue distortion.

195–239 s: The surgeon continues to place stitches sequentially adjacent to the earlier ones. From 195–209 s and 210–224 s the needle is grasped near its midshaft and rotated through the tissue in short controlled arcs while the forceps provide precise countertraction and evert the skin lip to guarantee epidermal contact when tied. At 225–239 s another pass is taken with the needle driver and forceps closely coordinated; the operator aims for symmetric epidermal bites to avoid step-offs. Several frames show repeated re‑grasps of the needle and short withdrawal arcs, consistent with placing interrupted stitches tightly spaced along the medial edge of the incision.

240–299 s: The work progresses distally/proximally along the incision in a methodical fashion. Between 240–254 s and 255–269 s a new bite is placed at the proximal end of a row of interrupted sutures, with the driver approaching from above/left and the forceps opposing from the right. At 270–284 s and 285–299 s the operator alternates placement and knot‑securing maneuvers; the suture tails are arranged and occasionally clamped with a hemostat, while the next needle is oriented and reintroduced. Throughout these passes the needle driver often approaches from a slightly superior/medial angle and the forceps hold the lateral edge slightly inferior and lateral — tips converge at a narrow working zone and cross over the incision during gripping and transfer.

300–359 s: Progression continues toward the opposite end of the defect. From 300–314 s and 315–329 s the pattern repeats: the left hand delivers the needle, the right hand steadies and receives it, and the needle is pulled through to produce a snug, slightly everted approximation. At 330–344 s and 345–359 s the operator finishes the remaining lateral portion of the wound: the needle is grasped near the distal third for more precise control, passes are shallow and dermal, and after each placement the suture is tensioned and tied with instrument throws. The operator routinely repositions the needle driver between passes and occasionally withdraws and re‑grasps the needle to optimize the arc for the next bite.

360–419 s: The mid‑procedure phase emphasizes finalizing each interrupted stitch and trimming tails. In 360–374 s and 375–389 s several frames show a brief appearance of multiple closely spaced stitches that, in one view, give a running appearance along a short segment; however, the dominant behaviour throughout is individual interrupted bites being placed and secured. At 390–404 s, 405–419 s and into this interval the needle is repeatedly rotated through tissue and then drawn back for knot tying; the forceps lifts and aligns each lip just ahead of the needle to maintain even eversion and consistent bite depth. Instrument usage is regular: needle driver in the delivering hand, forceps in the opposing hand, occasional scissors or hemostat used for tail management.

420–479 s: The operator concentrates on the superior end of the incision. From 420–434 s the left hand holds a long needle driver coming down nearly longitudinal to the pad while the right hand’s forceps oppose and control the near edge; small controlled perpendicular passes are taken and the suture pulled through. In 435–449 s the operator tightens and finalizes distal stitches then prepares another proximal bite. Between 450–464 s and 465–479 s the needle is grasped proximal to the midpoint for controlled passes and instrument ties are used to secure each interrupted stitch in place. Throughout these frames the hands remain close together (≈1–3 cm), and the operator is attentive to bite symmetry and epidermal edge apposition.

480–539 s: The final active placements and finishing maneuvers occur in this time window. From 480–494 s and 495–509 s multiple adjacent bites are placed sequentially along the lateral edge, moving the closure toward completion. Needle handling is consistent: the curved swaged needle is held near midshaft, the driver rotates it through tissue in short arcs and then withdraws it for the next pass. Between 510–524 s and 525–539 s the operator continues sequential placement from one end to the other, then performs instrument ties, trims tails, and tidies the suture morphology. Several passes are visibly shallow and skin‑level, producing closely spaced, evenly spaced interrupted sutures; the forceps continually evert the lips at each bite so that the final approximation is slightly convex rather than inverted.

540–550 s (closing frames): The procedure concludes with the incision approximated by a continuous line of closely spaced interrupted sutures with visible external knot loops along the lateral edge. Hands are less present in the final frames; when visible a single gloved hand momentarily appears near the top‑right area of the pad but no fresh needle passes are observed. At this stage the stitch row appears mostly complete and matured — wounds are approximated with slight eversion, suture tails are organized or trimmed, and no additional passes are being taken.

Technique and instrument patterns throughout
- Two‑handed instrument technique dominated the entire case. One hand (most often the left) held the needle driver, controlling needle orientation and rotation; the opposing hand (most often the right) used toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style) to lift, evert and stabilize the near edge and to receive the needle tip after each pass. Occasionally hands exchanged roles or the operator used scissors/hemostat to manage tails, but the same fundamental choreography persisted.
- Needle control was consistent: curved, swaged needles were grasped near the mid‑shaft to distal third for precise arcs. The driver rotated the needle through epidermal/dermal tissue in controlled short arcs and then withdrew it for instrument tying. Bites were small, superficial and skin‑level on the synthetic model; there was no evidence of deep layered or fascial closure — all handling was at the dermal/epidermal plane.
- Suture progression followed a predictable sequential pattern. The operator placed a bite adjacent to an existing stitch, pulled the suture through, tensioned and organized the tail, performed instrument‑based knot tying, and trimmed the tail before moving on. This repeated cycle advanced the closure along the full length of the incision until the defect was closed from one end toward the other.
- Edge management and apposition were consistent. Each bite was aimed to produce slight eversion, avoiding skin inversion; forceps were used to control epidermal alignment and minimize puckering. The synthetic tissue produced mild puckering around earlier knots, but the operator kept catches shallow and tension moderated to achieve close approximation without excessive bunching.
- Spatial relationships were tightly confined: the tips of the driver and forceps generally converged in a 1–4 cm working zone directly adjacent to the incision. Approaches were often from superior‑medial (driver) and lateral‑inferior (forceps), the instruments crossing over the incision line as required to pass the needle and tie knots.

Limitations and visual uncertainties
- A few segments of the recording had limited visualization of the needle itself; in some frames needle grasp and exact orientation could not be confirmed because instruments obscured the tip or the camera angle limited resolution. In one set of frames near the end the operator’s activities suggested tying and trimming rather than fresh needle passage, and the needle/holder was not clearly visible. These intermittent viewing limitations do not alter the clear sequence of repeated interrupted passes and knot securing observed overall.
- There were brief appearances suggesting a short continuous run in one segment, but the predominant, repeated behaviour observed throughout is placement of individual interrupted stitches — each being passed, tensioned and tied before proceeding.

Final condition of the wound
By the end of the video the right‑sided vertical incision is closed with a contiguous series of tightly spaced interrupted sutures. The edges are approximated with slight eversion across the length of the slit; knots are visible along the lateral edge and suture tails have been managed (tensioned and trimmed). No further needle passes are made in the terminal frames and instruments are withdrawn from the working zone, indicating completion of the superficial skin closure. Overall, the procedure demonstrates a systematic, consistent interrupted suturing technique with focused two‑handed instrument control producing an even, slightly everted approximation of the simulated dermal edges.
