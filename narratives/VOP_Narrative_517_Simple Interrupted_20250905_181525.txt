COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a careful setup for the very first stitch. From the left, the needle holder brings in a curved needle, loaded on its proximal-to-middle third and oriented nearly perpendicular to the lower‑central slit on the practice pad. From the right, Adson forceps steady the target edge and help fine‑tune the needle’s orientation. No penetration occurs yet; this is precise positioning and alignment.

With the angle set, the operator transitions into the first pass. Forceps on the right stabilize the right edge and control the needle tip as the left‑hand driver advances the curve through the skin. As the needle exits, the driver regrips on the needle body to maintain a perpendicular orientation, then draws the suture through while the forceps protect the edge from drag. The short/tag end is left to the right, the standing limb trails left/inferior, and the needle is parked safely off to the side.

The field then pivots immediately to instrument tying. The driver becomes the tying tool while the right hand controls the free end. The first throw is formed by wrapping the standing limb over/around the driver, which crosses the midline to grasp the short end and pull it through, seating the throw down to the incision. A reverse wrap follows to square the knot. With each throw, the hands pull flat and in opposite directions across the wound, keeping the knot centered and the edges approximated without crushing. This rhythm—wrap, grasp, deliver, seat—continues through successive throws until the stitch lies snugly on the wound line with even tension and no gapping.

After securing that first stitch, the right hand stabilizes the knot and the left hand brings in scissors to trim the tails close to the knot. The field clears momentarily; then the left hand returns with a freshly loaded needle while the right hand reintroduces forceps, setting up for the next bite.

The next sequence mirrors the first with small refinements. The needle is already exiting at the right margin at the start; forceps steady the tip while the left‑hand driver grasps the needle on its body to complete the pull‑through. The driver then reorients the needle for the next pass but pauses—no new penetration yet. Instead, the focus shifts to tying: a second instrument is briefly used from the left to pass through the loop and capture the short end, laying a first throw; the wrap direction is reversed for the second throw, converting to a square knot. Throughout, tension is alternated and balanced so the knot seats flush and centered without blanching or edge inversion. The right hand sometimes assumes the driver to continue tying, while the left hand pinches the tail to maintain a short working length and steady post—an efficient division of roles that keeps the knot stack neat. As the knot is secured, the right hand takes up the needle holder again to reload the needle at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds, parking it away from the wound in preparation for the next bite.

Attention turns back to needle control and wound handling. With the driver in the left hand and Adsons in the right, the operator reloads the needle so its arc is perpendicular to the skin. The forceps evert and stabilize the right wound edge; a brief interlude with scissors trims an old tail near the center so the field stays clean. The needle tip is aligned to the intended entry point, and the driver pronates/supinates to fine‑tune the trajectory. The pass is then made: left hand drives the curved needle through the edge while the right hand’s forceps guide and protect the margin. After exiting, the driver regrips to complete draw‑through, leaving a long limb to the right. No second bite is taken—this sequence is building single, simple interrupted stitches one at a time.

Instrument tying resumes. Now the needle remains parked in the driver while the right hand manages the short tail. The operator performs classic alternating instrument ties: the right hand places loops over the driver; the driver grasps the tail, pull is applied in a flat, opposing vector, and the throw is seated directly over the incision. Wrap direction alternates with each throw to maintain a true square knot. The driver and right hand cross above the wound as needed but stay clear of tissue margins. When secure, scissors enter to trim both ends while the right hand gently tensions the line, finishing the stitch cleanly.

The flow of the case develops a steady cadence: place a bite with left‑hand driver and right‑hand forceps; pull through, park the needle safely; perform instrument ties with alternating wraps; seat throws flat and centered; cut tails; then reload for the next stitch. Between stitches, there are brief moments of housekeeping—regrasping the needle on the proximal‑to‑middle third for optimal control, orienting the curve perpendicular to the skin, and using the forceps only to stabilize tissue or the needle tip to avoid crushing the edges.

Midway, the camera shows a brief reset with the field mostly quiet and a few completed interrupted knots visible. The team then re‑enters to continue the line: the left hand brings in a loaded needle holder, the right hand forceps evert the next target edge near the superior portion of the central incision, and spacing is maintained consistent with the earlier stitches. A stitch is placed on a short superior slit above the prior knot line with the same principles—perpendicular needle trajectory, gentle dermal purchase, and controlled passage. The right hand then manages the free end while the left hand crosses the field with the driver to lay alternating instrument throws. Mild eversion is visible as the edges come together; the knot is seated centrally over the slit and trimmed.

The final tying sequences show the operator favoring a streamlined instrument‑tie technique without forceps on the tissue: the left‑hand driver hovers over the midline, the right hand manages the long strand and tail, loops are built and exchanged efficiently, and each throw is drawn down deliberately, flat across the incision. The row of simple interrupted knots grows, evenly spaced and slightly offset to one side as expected for this technique. In the closing frames, no hands are in the field—only a static view of the practice pad with approximately five secured, neatly centered simple interrupted stitches along the central wound. The edges are approximated with mild puckering and no gapping, reflecting consistent, balanced tension and a smooth, methodical suturing rhythm from first positioning to final cut.
