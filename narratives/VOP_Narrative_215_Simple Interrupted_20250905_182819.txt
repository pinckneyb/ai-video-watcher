COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a calm, left‑hand–dominant setup. From 0–14 s, the left hand carries a needle driver in from the superior/left, the curved needle loaded at the proximal-to-middle third and presented at a crisp 90° to the skin pad. The right hand arrives from the right with Adson forceps to gently evert the near dermal edge. The first bite is taken with a smooth wrist rotation that follows the curve; the driver briefly regrips along the needle arc to continue the passage. The right hand then transitions to the far edge to present tissue for the exit, keeping handling light and off the epidermal surface.

From 15–29 s, the cadence establishes itself: present, drive, retrieve, and pull through. Work moves between the rightmost and central incisions. The right hand alternates between lifting a margin and managing the suture line, keeping the strand out of the driver’s path. Each pass is set up perpendicular to the skin, with the right hand occasionally adjusting the needle angle before the left hand advances it. After each exit, the suture is drawn through cleanly, leaving a controlled tail while the long strand is steered away from the next bite.

Between 30–44 s, the sequence tightens. The left hand continues to drive and regrasp the needle after exit; the right hand uses forceps to guide the needle and control the suture. Midway, scissors appear in the left hand to trim tails; the needle driver is momentarily parked to the left of the field. By the end of this interval, two stitches in the central region show short, neatly trimmed tails—early evidence of the pattern that will define the rest of the closure.

At 45–59 s, attention is squarely on the central incision. The right hand everts and stabilizes the right wound edge for a consistent bite; the left hand drives the needle through with a controlled rotation, then aligns for a matched pass on the opposite side. Instruments cross only at the entry/exit point. After penetration, the suture is drawn through, leaving an appropriate tail before the next move.

From 60–74 s, the rhythm becomes almost metronomic. The left hand regrips as needed to complete each arc; the right hand lifts the next edge, manages the free end, and tensions the line as the needle and suture clear the wound. A short tail is left on the near side, the standing strand guided away to prevent snagging on adjacent incisions.

A brief interlude follows at 75–89 s. The left hand still holds the driver, sometimes swapping to scissors, while the right hand primarily controls the suture and needle rather than the tissue. The operator rehearses needle positioning above the surface—confirming perpendicular alignment and arc trajectory—before returning to tissue engagement.

At 90–104 s, the procedural flow resumes. The right hand picks up the near edge at the dermal margin; the left hand drives the needle across with a smooth, perpendicular entry and controlled arc. The right hand then presents the far edge and helps reorient the needle for retrieval. The suture from previous throws is deliberately kept lateral to avoid tangling.

Between 105–119 s, the scene shifts to tying. The needle remains safely out of the wound while the left hand, still with the driver, performs instrument ties. The right hand delivers the short tail to the midline and maintains tension. Throws are alternated and seated neatly over the incision, keeping the edges approximated without crushing.

From 120–134 s, tails are trimmed close—brief cutting appears via the driver/scissor function—completing that stitch. The focus then transitions toward the left-side incision: the right hand elevates that edge, and the left hand reloads the needle perpendicular to the surface, aligning for the next bite while maintaining the same clean instrument zoning.

At 135–149 s, the left hand uses the driver first as a knot pusher to finish seating a central knot, then reloads the needle correctly on its body with the curve facing the target. The right hand alternates between holding the free end during tying and using forceps to position the needle, preparing for another stitch along the neighboring incision.

From 150–164 s, another pass is executed over the midline: the left hand advances the needle at 90°, the right hand stabilizes and everts the edge, then helps regrasp and retrieve on the far side. Symmetry of depth and width is maintained, and the suture ends are organized inferiorly in preparation for tying.

The pattern holds through 165–179 s and 180–194 s. The left hand consistently controls the needle; the right hand uses fine pickups to present tissue, occasionally grasping the needle body for safe handoffs. Each bite is driven along its arc with deliberate regrasping. After exits, the suture is pulled through with measured tension to avoid strangulation, and spacing remains consistent along the central line already populated with simple interrupted sutures.

At 195–209 s, there’s a tidy reset. No new tissue penetration occurs; instead, the right hand organizes loops and tails near the most recent knot while the left driver provides gentle counter-tension. Scissors then make a brief appearance in the right hand to cut the tails flush, after which the left hand returns with the driver and the right with forceps to continue.

From 210–224 s and 225–239 s, additional stitches are placed adjacent to the existing series. The left hand grasps the needle at the proximal third, presents it perpendicular to the pad, and advances with a wrist rotation. As the point emerges, the right hand receives the needle tip with forceps for a controlled handoff; the driver regrips the body to pull through. The right hand manages slack and everts the next edge. Suture lines are laid down neatly in preparation for tying.

At 240–254 s, the left hand maintains tension on the standing end after knot throws while the right hand briefly exchanges forceps for scissors to trim tails close to the knot; then the right hand returns to forceps to evert the next bite site. The left hand stays centered and slightly proximal, anchoring the field and ensuring the next needle entry will again be square to the skin.

The sequence concludes from 255–268 s with dedicated post‑knot grooming. The right hand lifts individual tails with Adsons to create safe clearance, and the left hand, now with straight scissors, trims each pair neatly and evenly, cutting close to the knot without disturbing the closure. The hands avoid crossing, the scissors cut where the tails are tensioned, and then both withdraw, leaving a clean, aligned incision line with multiple well-spaced simple interrupted sutures and uniformly short tails.

Across the full run, the technique evolves from deliberate, measured setup to a smooth, repeatable cadence. The left hand remains the constant driver—loading at the proximal third, entering at 90°, regrasping along the arc—while the right hand orchestrates tissue presentation, needle handoffs, and suture management. Tying and trimming are interleaved at logical pauses, with the driver sometimes parked to admit scissors and then reclaimed for the next pass. The overall flow is efficient and organized: bite, retrieve, pull-through, tie, trim, move one space over, and repeat—until the line is closed and the field is left clear.
