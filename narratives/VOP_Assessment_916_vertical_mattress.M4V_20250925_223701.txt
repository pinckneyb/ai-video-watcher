COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure is concentrated on the single right‑most vertical incision of the practice pad, a linear slit positioned close to the pad’s lateral edge. From the first frames through to the end of the recording, all actions — needle passes, tissue handling, knot management and suture trimming — are directed to that same lateral wound. The operator repeatedly returns instruments and hands to the same narrow working zone, advancing closure along the length of this one incision and steadily building a continuous, closely spaced series of bites that progressively approximate the wound edges.

Initial needle placement and setup (0–44 s)
At the outset the operator establishes the working geometry for closure. A curved suture needle is mounted in the needle driver and grasped roughly mid‑shaft/near the body of the needle rather than exclusively at the tip. The driver approaches from the upper‑right quadrant and the opposing hand uses fine forceps or fingers to stabilize the inferior/medial wound edge. The forceps consistently engage the tissue at the intended entry point to evert and stabilize the lip while the needle is advanced through the opposite margin. Early passes show the needle oriented across the short axis of the incision with controlled rotation through a gentle arcuate trajectory; the non‑dominant hand manages the suture tail and lightly tensions the loop as the needle exits.

Establishing the stitch series (45–119 s)
Following the initial bites, the operator places successive passes adjacent to the first. Needle handling remains consistent: the driver is typically held above and slightly lateral to the wound, grasping the curved needle in the mid‑to‑proximal shaft; the tip is rotated under control to penetrate and emerge through the synthetic dermal analog. The partner hand provides counter‑traction and directly manipulates the tissue to lift and evert the near edge so that each bite captures opposing dermal margins. During these frames the operator routinely draws the thread through after each pass and positions the suture for the subsequent cinch or tying step. Some segments show the operator preparing suture loops for knot formation; elsewhere the operator simply pulls the needle through and holds tension for the next bite. Throughout these early placements hands remain within 1–3 cm of one another, providing tight coordination in a compact working field.

Progressive placement and pattern formation (120–209 s)
As the sequence progresses the stitch pattern becomes denser and more regular. The needle driver and forceps maintain their relative orientations — the driver repeatedly approaches from lateral/superior angles while the tissue‑holding instrument sits medial/inferior — and each new pass is placed in close proximity to the preceding one. The operator alternates controlled needle rotation and withdrawal with brief periods of suture manipulation and light tissue apposition. Repeated frames document bites taken either perpendicular or slightly oblique to the long axis of the wound; the result is a column of closely spaced fixation points that begin to form an interlocked or X/ladder appearance along the incision.

In several frames the operator pauses to arrange suture tails and tighten existing knots rather than to place a fresh bite. These interludes involve grasping the loop or tail with the needle‑holder and positioning the suture for secure tying; the opposing hand steadies tissue while the knot is seated. At times the operator trims or prepares suture tails, indicating intermittent completion of individual stitches embedded within the continuing series.

Transition to continuous/interlocking progression (210–299 s)
Mid‑procedure the technique shifts from placing isolated single stitches to a more serial, continuous progression along the wound. Multiple previously placed bites appear as a continuous column with slight eversion of the edges, and the operator advances cephalad (and at times caudad) along the incision to add additional passes. Needle grips remain consistent — held mid‑shaft for controlled leverage — and the needle is driven in short, controlled arcs that capture near and far edges with minimal tissue trauma. The non‑dominant hand routinely lifts and evert the near edge and tensions the suture as the needle is withdrawn, producing close apposition. Where earlier frames emphasize individual interrupted passes and knot handling, this middle segment shows a more rhythmic sequence of bite → pull through → reposition → repeat, creating the interlocking, closely spaced stitch column.

Throughout this phase the hands remain tightly coordinated and spatially concentrated along the lateral margin: the instrument hand frequently positions itself superior‑lateral to the immediate bite while the tissue hand sits inferior‑medial, typically 1–4 cm apart. Suture tails consistently extend laterally out of the working zone and are managed by the non‑dominant hand between passes.

Refinement, tightening and knot work (300–344 s)
Later in the sequence the operator focuses on finishing the superior portion of the closure and refining the existing series of bites. The needle driver continues to manipulate a curved needle through shallow dermal bites while forceps or fingers maintain eversion. The pattern of diagonal mattress‑type bites and interlocked loops becomes more apparent: completed stitches show slight outward eversion with very small, closely spaced bites creating a laddered appearance. During these frames there are repeated cycles of passing the needle, pulling the suture through, tightening the loop so the edges seat snugly, and occasionally arranging the suture for final knot throws.

The operator also spends time arranging and adjusting suture tails and seating completed knots. There are multiple observations of the dominant instrument poised above the wound—sometimes holding a needle, sometimes manipulating a loop—and the opposite hand actively organizing suture limbs and stabilizing tissue for secure knot formation. By the end of this interval the wound’s inferior portion appears nearly complete and attention is concentrated on completing the remaining proximal passes.

Final passes and completion (345–365 s)
In the closing frames the operator places an additional proximal stitch and tensions it into the existing pattern, further interlocking the series. Needle passes remain controlled and shallow, oriented to capture the dermal/epidermal layers of the synthetic pad and to preserve edge eversion. The operator tightens the new pass into the established ladder of bites and completes final knot work and suture management. A last adjustment trims or lays down suture tails and the needle is removed from the field. The hands withdraw slightly, leaving a continuous, closely approximated column of stitches along the entire length of the right‑most incision.

Technique consistency and evolution
Across the entire recording the operator’s technique shows consistency in core elements: the same lateral incision is worked from initial pass to final tie, a curved needle is repeatedly grasped mid‑shaft in the needle driver, and the opposing hand continuously provides counter‑traction, eversion and suture control. The manner of passing the needle (short, controlled arcs rather than broad sweeping bites), the tight working distance between hands (typically 1–4 cm), and the progressive close spacing of bites remain constant. Over time the approach matures from isolated bite placement and suture preparation to a more efficient, rhythmic series of passes that collectively produce an interlocked, laddered closure. Where some frames show discrete interrupted bites with knot manipulation between them, other frames show a more running or continuous progression that ties successive passes into an interdependent pattern; both behaviors occur but always on the same lateral incision and with identical handling principles.

Hand position and spatial relationships
Hand positions evolve only modestly: the dominant (instrument) hand repeatedly operates from a superior/lateral trajectory, while the non‑dominant hand provides inferior/medial stabilization and suture management. When knotwork is required the dominant hand may shift to grasp suture loops or tails, and the non‑dominant hand temporarily adopts a more active role in manipulating the tissue and tensioning the knot. Instruments remain close together throughout — coordinated within a few centimeters — enabling precise needle control and fine adjustment of tension. The suture tails are consistently routed laterally, kept out of the immediate needle path, and actively managed to prevent entanglement during successive passes.

Observational limitations and minor inconsistencies
Because the model material is synthetic, assessment of bite depth, tissue purchase and ultimate knot security is inherently limited. Some frames imply that bites are superficial and lie within dermal/epidermal analog layers; others present the appearance of full‑thickness capture of the pad material. Additionally, the recorded sequence shows both episodes of completing individual interrupted stitches (with knot seating and tail trimming) and episodes of continuous interlocked passes; while this could reflect a deliberate hybrid approach to the closure, the exact intention cannot be ascertained solely from the imagery. Despite these minor ambiguities, the operator’s handling remains controlled and consistent in approach.

Final appearance
At the end of the procedure the right‑most vertical incision is closed with a dense, regularly spaced column of stitches that produce slight edge eversion and close apposition along the length of the wound. Multiple adjacent bites form an interlocked/laddered pattern, and the most proximal portion has been finished and integrated into the existing series. Suture tails have been positioned or trimmed, knots are seated along the column, and no gross gapping is visible along the closure. Instrument hands pull away slightly, leaving a neatly approximated lateral incision whose contour reflects the careful sequence of short, controlled needle passes and coordinated tissue handling carried out throughout the recording.
