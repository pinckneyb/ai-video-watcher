COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The closure begins on the vertical slit at the far right edge of the pad. From the very first moments, the operator commits to this one wound and never leaves it; the two central slits remain untouched in every sequence. The work is deliberate and sequential, with each stitch added, tied, and trimmed before moving on to the next segment along this same right-side incision.

Initial access and first passes are set up with a working triangle over the right slit. At the outset, the left hand carries the needle driver and the right hand holds tissue forceps. The forceps gently lift and evert the right wound edge while the driver, holding the curved needle roughly two-thirds from the tip, brings the needle perpendicular to the skin and places the first entry point at the right epidermal/dermal junction. The orientation is precise; the suture thread trails inferiorly and leftward, kept clear of the other cuts. After the initial bite is initiated through the right edge, the driver adjusts its grip to maintain the needle’s natural curvature and advances the tip across the gap toward the left edge. With the non-dominant hand stabilizing the pad and subtly presenting the margins, the needle follows its arc through the opposite side. A loop forms as the strand follows, and the slack is drawn through while maintaining gentle approximation of the edges. Through these early passes, tissue is handled gently—tip bites and fingertip stabilization are used instead of crushing forceps, and the driver respects the needle’s curve to minimize trauma.

As the first stitch completes its passage, the scene evolves toward knot tying. The driver, now in the right hand, controls the needle and strand while the left hand manages the free end. The suture is tensioned just enough to bring the wound edges together without blanching. Instrument ties are performed in a controlled cadence: the driver releases the needle when needed and alternately wraps and grasps the short end to throw square knots over the incision. The knot is seated on the right side of the wound, confirming the chosen orientation for the series. A brief introduction of scissors from the left signals readiness for trimming when the throws are secure, but in the earliest tying sequences, cutting may be deferred until subsequent frames. The first completed stitch near the lower portion of the slit leaves a small, tidy knot with short tails.

With the first stitch secured, attention shifts a few millimeters superiorly along the same wound. Hand roles sometimes switch: at times the left hand again takes the needle driver while the right hand uses forceps; at other moments, the right hand drives and the left hand handles tissue or the suture tail. Regardless of hand dominance, the technique remains consistent. The needle is loaded on its proximal third to mid-shaft, perpendicular to the skin surface. The near (right) wound edge is everted with forceps or finger pressure and the entry point is set a few millimeters from the margin, matching the depth and spacing of the prior bite to maintain even approximation. The needle’s arc is advanced across to the far (left) side, and the strand is pulled through carefully, slack removed without dragging the epidermis.

The second stitch is tied in instruments. The driver regrips the needle as needed to keep it out of the way and uses its jaws for precise loop formation and tail capture. The assistant hand shifts seamlessly between forceps use—briefly touching down to present or steady an edge—and suture management, maintaining counter-tension. As the knot cinches, the edges align without gapping, and again the knot sits to the right of the slit. In the immediate next interval, the scissors appear from the left or superolateral angle to trim the tails close to the knot while protecting the newly coapted edges. The rhythm is established: pass, draw through, tie, cut.

Progress then continues in the mid-to-lower and mid portions of the same incision. The operator alternates between finger stabilization and Adson forceps to handle tissue. When forceps are used, they grasp the dermal edge lightly to evert and expose the dermis; when fingers are used, they press on the pad near the edge to steady and mildly tension the synthetic skin. The needle is repeatedly held at the proximal third, near-perpendicular to the surface, and driven across in a smooth, semicircular motion. Suture management remains careful. The long limb often trails leftward across the field but is kept out of the way; the short limb is manipulated near the wound for tying. The knots are thrown in sequence, with the driver performing alternating throws to ensure square, secure knots seated consistently on the right side. Short trimmed tails accumulate, visually marking the progress along the line.

At several points, the narrative pauses to finish a knot or manage slack on a just-placed stitch. In one sequence, the right hand uses the needle’s body to tension the strand and snug a throw before the scissors cut the tail, an efficient interlude where no new bites are taken. In another, the operator reloads the needle and repositions the suture length without penetrating tissue, establishing the setup for the next stitch. These moments of preparation maintain continuity of the technique and ensure well-spaced, symmetric bites as the closure moves upward.

As the closure advances to the mid-upper segment of the right slit, previously placed stitches hold the lower edges neatly approximated. The operator now works just above these completed knots. The working triangle becomes especially evident: the needle driver is positioned lateral and slightly superior to the next intended bite; the forceps (or fingertips) take station on the opposite side to provide counter-traction and present the dermis; the suture tail is kept clear, trailing away from the active zone. When the right edge is lifted, the driver brings the needle tip to the entry point, perforates the near edge, and rotates through in a controlled arc toward the far side. The left edge is then engaged—either directly by the needle following the curve or by the assistant hand helping to expose it—so the needle exits symmetrically. The thread is pulled through, leaving a span of suture across the wound that will be cinched with instrument ties.

Knot tying at this stage is confident and consistent. Multiple throws are formed with the driver wrapping the working limb and securing the tail to lay down square, alternating throws. Tension is applied just enough to seat the knot on the dermal surface without over-compressing the tissue. The assisting hand’s role varies—sometimes holding tissue out of the way, sometimes lifting the tail to create space for the driver to grasp, and often providing gentle counter-tension while the driver advances each throw into position. Once secure, the scissors enter from a safe angle—often from the left or superolateral approach—to trim the tails close to the knot without nicking adjacent strands or disturbing neighboring stitches. After trimming, the field briefly clears, showing tidy knots aligned along the right side of the wound.

The operator then steps further superiorly, repeating the cycle. In one segment, the left hand holds the needle driver while the right hand forceps control the right edge; the needle is positioned to enter the left edge first, reflecting flexibility in approach while maintaining the same wound and stitch orientation. Even with this variation, symmetry of bites is preserved and the next stitch is initiated just above the existing series. In another run, the right hand holds the needle driver above and slightly right of the incision while the left hand manages suture slack, drawing and releasing tension to keep the strand out of the needle path. Regripping the needle is done close to the instrument’s tip, avoiding deep grabs with fingers, which preserves sterility and control.

Throughout these upper-wound sequences, previously placed stitches maintain approximation below, and the operator is careful not to snag or drag the new passes against earlier knots. Instrument ties remain the consistent method of securing each stitch. Where the left hand was earlier more engaged in tissue presentation, it increasingly helps with suture control and counter-tension during tying as the working area narrows near the top. The needle’s orientation stays perpendicular to the surface, and the depth and spacing remain even relative to the wound margin. Short trimmed tails near each knot attest to sequential completion.

Several discrete tying-and-trimming sequences punctuate this later phase. One shows the driver held just to the right of the incision, tip over the knot, while scissors approach from the left to cut the tails tight to the knot. Another shows successive throws being tightened over the most recent stitch without taking additional bites, followed by a clean tail trim. There are also brief preparatory moments where the needle is reloaded and the strand length is managed, but no penetration occurs—these are clearly setup intervals ensuring the next stitch will be placed in the intended position with proper strand control.

As the closure nears the superior end of the slit, the same method continues: a bite is planned just above the last knot, the near edge is everted with forceps or fingertip pressure, the needle passes right-to-left across the slit in a smooth arc, and the suture is drawn through. The driver then works above the wound to perform instrument ties, with the left hand holding the tail lateral or inferior to maintain clean tension. The knot is cinched down flush to the dermal surface, then trimmed. In one sequence, the operator repositions repeatedly just above the planned bite site—evidence of careful needle planning—while the assistant hand maintains gentle strand tension to keep the field clear. The line overhead remains free of confusion; only this right-side slit is manipulated, while the central slits remain visibly open and inactive.

By the final active segments, an orderly series of interrupted stitches spans the mid-to-upper part of the wound, atop those already placed in the lower and mid segments. The stitches are evenly spaced, the bites are symmetrical, and the knots are consistently seated on the right side of the incision. The edges are coapted without gapping, with just enough eversion from forceps work or fingertip support to suggest a proper dermal apposition. Scissors work is careful and accurate; tails are short across the line. There is a brief interval where the field is unattended—no hands or instruments visible and no new steps undertaken—but this pause does not interrupt the integrity of the closure. When the field is seen again, no additional changes are made; the stitched line appears complete and stable.

Hand and instrument behavior over the course of the case reflects a steady refinement rather than a change in technique. The operator occasionally alternates which hand holds the driver and which hand uses forceps, adapting ergonomics to the current bite location, but the principles remain the same: the needle is grasped at its proximal third to mid-shaft, held perpendicular to the surface; tissue handling is gentle with minimal crush, relying on tip bites and careful eversion; and each stitch is completed with well-executed instrument ties. Spatially, the driver and forceps establish a small working triangle across the slit—driver on the side initiating the bite, forceps on the opposing side to present tissue, and the suture tail trailing away from the working zone. When cutting, scissors approach from a direction that protects the knot and existing stitches. Regripping occurs when needed to maintain control of needle orientation and suture tension.

The overall progression is linear and methodical. It begins at the lower portion of the wound with the first passes and knot, then steps upward along the same slit, adding one stitch at a time. Each stitch is fully secured before the next is initiated. Interspersed segments show tightening of prior throws and trimming of tails. Preparatory sequences—where the operator reloads the needle and manages strand length without taking a bite—serve to maintain the pace and accuracy of placement. By the time the upper end of the slit is reached, the line is bridged by multiple evenly placed stitches with knots aligned to the right. There is no deviation to the central slits at any point; they remain open and unmanipulated throughout.

In the final state, the right-edge incision is neatly approximated by a series of completed stitches. The edges are well aligned with consistent bite depth and spacing, the knots are square and firmly seated on the right side, and the tails are cut short. The closure reads as a coherent, continuous effort on the same wound from start to finish: initiate a bite on the right edge, follow the needle’s arc to the left, draw the strand through, perform instrument ties to square down the knot, and cut. This cycle repeats, advancing superiorly with careful attention to tissue handling, suture management, and instrument positioning. The result is a tidy, stable wound closure along the rightmost incision with no undue tension or gapping, and a clear visual distinction from the untouched central slits.
