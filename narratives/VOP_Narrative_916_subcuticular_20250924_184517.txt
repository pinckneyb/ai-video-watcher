COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad marked with three parallel vertical incisions. From the outset the work is concentrated on the center line, a straight vertical slit with small ink dots indicating target entry and exit points. The operator repeatedly returns to this same line to place and secure individual stitches, progressively approximating its edges from the lower half toward the superior portion. The neighboring slits are visible but remain functionally out of play; the technique and hand choreography you see—needle passage, transfer, tensioning, and instrument ties—are consistently applied to the central cut as the closure advances.

The first sequence establishes the rhythm and principles that remain constant throughout. The left hand drives a curved needle held in a ring-handled needle driver, its jaws grasping the needle at roughly the proximal third to the junction of the middle third. The needle is oriented perpendicular to the skin surface to set up a proper, controlled arc. The right hand, holding Adson-style tissue forceps, elevates and everts the near wound edge to present the entry site and to control bite depth. The needle is advanced in a smooth, sweeping motion across the slit, passing from one edge to the other at approximately equal distances from the incision line, guided by the ink dots. After penetration, the driver releases and regrips as needed to follow the needle through, and the suture is drawn across. The hands then transition seamlessly into an instrument tie: the driver stays on the short end, the right hand takes the long end, and successive throws are formed, alternately reversing direction to square and lock the knot directly over the wound. Tension on the strands is applied parallel to the incision to avoid shearing while the edges come together with gentle, symmetric eversion. No forceps are used during the tying phase in this initial pass; approximation is achieved by suture tension alone.

With that foundational stitch secured at the midline, the operator prepares the next bite along the same central slit. The pattern is consistent: the needle is reloaded in the driver at the proximal third, again presented perpendicular to the skin. The right hand returns with forceps to stabilize the nearest edge, everting it just enough to expose the dermal layer. The approach alternates as needed—sometimes the driver comes from the left side of the field toward the right edge, other times from the right toward the left—always arranging the wrist and needle so the curvature matches the tissue. As each pass is initiated, the tip is placed just at or near the inked dots to keep spacing regular and the depth symmetric. The instrument tips oppose one another across the incision during the pass; after the needle punctures, the assisting instrument crosses the wound to seize the needle tip and control the arc on exit. This opposition—driver on one side, forceps on the other—repeats throughout the case and is key to maintaining a true perpendicular path and to avoiding skiving through the epidermis.

On several passes, instead of forceps the assistant uses a second needle holder to grasp the needle or manage the suture strand. This is especially evident when the right hand forgoes tissue handling and simply takes the suture to manage tension and clearance while the left hand, still on the driver, continues to deliver the needle. Regardless of whether forceps or a second driver is used, the principles do not change: the needle is kept at roughly two-thirds from the tip in the jaws, the arc is orthogonal to the skin, and the tip is controlled on exit to complete a true, symmetric bite across both wound edges.

As more stitches are planned on the same line, the operator refines handedness to keep the needle trajectory sound. At times the right hand runs the driver while the left hand opposes with forceps from the far side; at other times the left hand drives and the right hand assists. This alternation allows the needle to be driven from right to left or left to right with equal control, depending on where the next bite is needed along the incision. The field is kept tidy: suture loops are elevated and laid gently to one side, and as each pass is completed the assistant lifts the strand to avoid dragging or catching on adjacent surfaces. The operator is careful not to cross strands over the neighboring practice cuts; even when the hands cross over the wound during needle transfer, the standing end is kept clear and the working end is directed squarely across the active line.

The next series of passes concentrates around the middle third and then marches superiorly. After one pass is completed across the center incision, the suture is drawn through and straightened to prepare for knot tying. The knot is thrown with instrument ties, the driver controlling the short end and the assistant managing the long end. Multiple alternating throws are seated gently but decisively over the incision, with the edges brought together under modest tension that preserves gentle eversion rather than inversion or flattening. In one instance, after a new stitch is placed across the middle of the line, the scissors briefly enter from above and trim the ends, leaving short, neat tails. This reinforces the pattern of placing individual interrupted stitches and completing them before moving on.

As the operator advances superiorly on the same central slit, the same technique continues. A pass is driven from the right edge to the left at the upper half, with the left instrument taking the needle tip as it emerges. The exit and entry points again mirror the dots printed on the pad. The suture is drawn through cleanly, forming a broad arc over the pad as the needle is retrieved and reloaded. With the new pass in place, the hands shift into tying. The driver remains on the short end while the assistant alternates the long strand around it to create successive instrument throws, tightening each throw with hands diverging laterally and then lifting vertically to seat the knot directly over the incision. The knot is cinched carefully; the edges are approximated with mild eversion, and there is no crushing or excessive manipulation of the synthetic dermis. On a subsequent stitch high on the line, the right hand holds the driver with the needle resting above the wound through the tying sequence and does not redrive the needle; all attention is on securing the existing stitch with multiple throws.

At one point, while another pass is being driven at the mid-to-upper portion of the central slit, the operator’s head or body briefly encroaches on the field and partially obscures the view. Despite this, the placement continues with the same basic approach, and the needle emerges on the far edge where it is captured and the suture drawn through. Shortly thereafter, the needle is regripped at roughly the proximal third and oriented perpendicular for the next bite, confirming methodical progression along the same line. On these sequences the instruments straddle the incision, with the driver crossing the midline to pull the needle through its arc, while the opposing forceps guides the exit and steadies the tissue. A large, smooth suture loop forms during draw-through, and both hands work within a few millimeters of the wound to maintain control without crowding the edges.

As the closure develops through the upper third of the central incision, another stitch is initiated by entering the right wound edge a few millimeters from the margin, at a depth consistent with the previous passes. The right margin is lifted with forceps to achieve eversion, and the left-hand driver starts the bite with a perpendicular entry. The driver then regrips the needle to continue its arc and draw the strand across the wound. In this moment the thread and needle end up positioned on the superior-right side as the suture is pulled through. The far-side bite is completed in the next sequence, and the operator transitions to knot tying, bringing the ends together and securing yet another interrupted stitch centered on the upper portion of the same line. After the throws are tightened, the suture ends are elevated, confirming that the knot is seated directly over the wound rather than off to one side.

In a later approach near the superior third, the right hand enters from the top-right with the needle driver. The scissors rest idle on the left of the field, and the non-dominant hand is momentarily out of frame. The driver aims the needle perpendicularly toward the planned bite site, but without the opposing hand to evert or stabilize the tissue, no new bite is completed in that interval. The edges remain flat against the pad, and the suture tail from a previous stitch is still visible near the superior portion. This brief lapse in tissue control highlights the importance of opposing forceps or an assisting instrument to set the depth and angle; without it, a perpendicular, symmetric pass is more difficult to accomplish.

Between active bouts of suturing, there are intervals when the hands and instruments are not in the field. During these pauses, the central incision remains unchanged: previously placed knots with short tails are visible near the midline and superior third, and the edges are approximated in those segments. Where no stitch has yet been placed, the wound edges lie relatively flat with slight gaping, especially away from the tied segments. The other two incisions on the practice pad continue to show no manipulation or suture material. These quiet spans do not advance the closure but confirm that the work has stayed anchored to the same central slit; no strands cross to the lateral cuts, and the field remains organized with suture tails trimmed short at finished knots.

Throughout, there is careful attention to spatial choreography. The hands often oppose each other across the wound—one lateral-right, the other lateral-left—with tips meeting over the incision. During needle passage, the instruments frequently cross over the wound, but the suture is kept clear to prevent entanglement. The driver generally holds the needle at the proximal third of its curve, maintaining an orthogonal approach to the tissue so each pass follows a smooth, semicircular trajectory. Once the needle penetrates, the assisting instrument—whether forceps or a second needle holder—seizes the tip/body to control the exit and to preserve the arc, preventing straightening or torquing that could enlarge the puncture. During tying, the short end remains secured in the driver; the opposite hand uses the long end to form loops around the driver tip, and the throw is tightened by separating the hands laterally and then elevating to seat the knot without dragging it along the skin. In several sequences the operator specifically elevates the suture ends vertically during knot seating; this helps the knot lay down centrally rather than slip off the edge. Where forceps are used to evert the edges during passage, the grasp is light and close to the epidermal surface, minimizing crush while still exposing the dermis to guide the needle. When a second needle holder is used in place of forceps, it grasps the suture rather than the tissue, assisting with tension and clearance while the driver completes the pass.

The technique remains consistent even as handedness and instrument roles switch. Whether the left or right hand is driving, the needle is controlled at the appropriate spot on its body, the entry angle is perpendicular, and the bite depth mirrors the opposite side. The operator frequently aligns the bite with the ink dots, ensuring symmetric placement. After each pass, slack is gently drawn through, and the suture is kept taut enough to prevent loops from snagging but not so tight as to strangulate tissue. Knot tying is always performed close to the wound, with adequate throw reversal to secure the stitch. On one occasion, the field is briefly obscured by the operator’s head, but the placement proceeds without deviation from the pattern. On another, the absence of opposing tissue control is noted and no bite is completed until proper stabilization can be reestablished.

By the end of the sequence, the central incision shows individual interrupted stitches placed at least at the mid and superior portions, each tied with instrument throws and trimmed to short tails. These stitches bring the edges together with mild eversion where they are situated. Between the secured points, the wound edges may still show some gaping consistent with spaces awaiting additional stitches, but the line itself remains straight and aligned, and there is no distortion from crossing strands. The lateral incisions have not been recruited into the closure; they remain untouched. Overall, the procedure demonstrates methodical, repeated application of a simple interrupted closure on the central slit: controlled perpendicular needle driving with symmetric tissue bites, careful hand opposition and instrument crossing during passage, deliberate, square instrument ties seated directly over the wound, and clean management of suture ends. Minor deficiencies—momentary field obscuration and a brief attempt at driving without tissue stabilization—are noted, but the operator consistently returns to the core principles, maintaining trajectory, tension, and placement quality along the same incision. The final state reflects a partially advanced closure of the central line with tidy, secure knots and approximated edges where sutures have been set, and a stable, uncluttered field ready for additional stitches to complete the line if desired.
