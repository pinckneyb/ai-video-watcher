Note on nomenclature and video consistency:
Several frame descriptions reference different numbered slits on the pad (e.g., “second from the left,” “third from the left,” “rightmost of four”), which suggests some inconsistency in how slit positions were labeled in the source notes or minor camera/field shifts during recording. For the purposes of this unified narrative, the worked wound will be described consistently as the central, vertical midline incision on the suturing pad. Where individual frame notes appeared to reference other numbered slits, those observations are treated as alternate descriptions of the same midline incision (camera angle/labeling variance), and any conflicting or ambiguous observations are flagged in context.

Chronological narrative of the procedure

0–30 seconds — initial placement and first pass
The operator begins by positioning over the midline vertical incision. Hands straddle the wound: a needle driver in one hand and fine tissue forceps in the other. The needle is a curved, swaged instrument grasped near the mid-to-proximal third of its curve, with the driver oriented roughly perpendicular to the skin surface. The forceps gently evert and stabilize the entry edge while the driver advances the tip orthogonally through the dermis. The needle follows its arc, exits the opposite edge, and the suture is drawn through, leaving a tail of adequate length for subsequent tying. Throughout these initial frames, instrument tips remain close to the wound edges, moving symmetrically and avoiding engagement of adjacent slits on the pad.

30–60 seconds — reloading and preparation for next bite
After the first pass is completed and the suture drawn through, the operator repositions the needle for the next bite. The needle is repeatedly regrasped near the proximal third or about two-thirds from the tip, with small wrist rotations to reorient the curvature for the next arc across the incision. The assisting hand alternates between providing tissue stabilization (with forceps or fingertip support) and managing the free suture limb. There is no knot tying yet in these frames; the emphasis is on accurate reloading of the needle, maintaining perpendicular approach, and preparing consistent bite depth and spacing along the same line.

60–105 seconds — a new bite and the first instrument tie sequence
A subsequent stitch is initiated and the needle tip is positioned at the near wound margin. The driver advances the needle in a smooth, arc-driven motion while the forceps lift and evert the far margin to present dermis. The needle is grasped slightly more proximal in some frames (proximal third to midpoint), but always oriented to follow the curve rather than force a straight pass. After the needle exits the opposite edge and the suture is drawn through, the operator begins to secure the bite: instrument ties are formed with alternating throws. The free end is controlled by an assistant instrument or a second driver while the primary driver forms loops and pulls the strands to seat the knot down onto the epidermal surface. Hands oppose each other across the incision during tying, with the long limb tensioned and the short tail stabilized to avoid gapping.

105–150 seconds — continued needle passes and early knot fashioning
Needle reloading and another bite occur over the same central incision. The needle is presented perpendicular to the skin, inserted a few millimeters from the epidermal border into the dermal layer, and exits symmetrically on the opposite side to achieve edge approximation with slight eversion. Following passage, the needle is often parked in the driver (held in the right-hand driver in many frames), while the left-hand instrument alternates between forceps and a second needle driver to form instrument ties. The tying technique is consistent: sequential, instrument-mediated throws are laid and tightened into square knots, with opposing traction applied by each instrument to seat the knot snugly but without excessive crushing of the edges.

150–195 seconds — securement at midpoint and transition to additional bites along the same line
The center of the incision becomes the focus for knot security. The operator forms multiple throws with coordinated crossing and pulling of the instruments; the left-hand sometimes crosses over the right-hand instrument as loops are advanced. The needle is periodically parked in the driver while tying proceeds; in several frames the needle remains held in the right-hand driver throughout knot formation and is later reoriented for the next pass. Tissue handling remains gentle—forceps lift, evert, and stabilize the margins without aggressive traction. Throughout tying, the knot is seated directly over the wound, and suture loops are drawn down so that the epidermal edges meet cleanly with minimal gapping.

195–225 seconds — completion of a knot and preparation for continued closure
A knot on a previously placed pass is clearly completed during this interval. Multiple instrument throws are advanced and tightened, and once the knot is secure the operators reorient and reload the needle for continued suturing along the same midline incision. Small variations in needle grip are noted (some frames show grasp at about one‑third from the tip, others two‑thirds), but the functional effect is consistent: controlled needle arc, perpendicular entry, and symmetric exit. The suture strand is managed to stay clear of adjacent slits, and instruments continue to oppose one another across the wound while preparing for the next bite.

225–255 seconds — another bite placed and knot tying resumed
A new stitch is taken at the incision midpoint: the needle is driven through one edge and out the opposite edge, following a classic simple interrupted pattern in which each pass is individually secured. Right-hand and left-hand roles continue to alternate; one instrument maintains the standing end while the other forms wraps and grasps the short tail to advance the throw. The operator again uses instrument ties to produce square, alternating throws. Slight eversion is maintained by the assisting forceps during passage and while knots are tightened, which helps bring dermal edges into an approximation that is cosmetically favorable and functionally sound.

255–279 seconds — final passes, parking, and trimming
As the procedure approaches conclusion, the needle is reloaded and positioned for a final bite above the previously tied knots. At this stage the needle is frequently held in the left-hand driver prior to passage, then transferred or parked depending on the subsequent knot-tying sequence. Once the final knot has been formed and cinched down, scissors approach from the left in the later frames to trim the suture tails. Hands cross above the incision during the final throws, then realign so the knot is centered over the wound and the cut ends are removed, leaving short, neat tails. The entire working corridor remains confined to the midline incision; adjacent slits are avoided, and the suture material is kept clear of other lines on the pad.

Technique progression and evolution throughout the case
The operator’s technique is consistent and deliberate throughout the recording. Needle handling evolves subtly with the demands of each step: from initial midshaft grasp and perpendicular entries to slightly more proximal or distal grips when parking and tying are required. The predominant pattern is a series of simple interrupted stitches, each placed through symmetric bites taken a few millimeters from the epidermal border and drawn through to allow instrument tie-down. Knot-tying is performed as instrument ties using alternating throws to produce square knots, with the needle frequently held in one driver while the other advances loops and tensions the suture. When instrument tying, the long limb is used to form loops while the short limb is stabilized by forceps or a second driver, then pulled through and seated to avoid gapping.

Hands and instrument relationships
Throughout, the working hands remain opposed across the incision, creating a consistent corridor for visualization and needle passage. Early in the sequence the needle driver commonly approaches from the operator’s left while the forceps control the right wound edge; later, for tying, drivers from both hands come to rest over the wound and cross as loops are advanced. The instrument tips stay within a few millimeters of the epidermal margins, and the operators maintain perpendicular approach angles for accurate dermal bites. Occasional brief involvement by a second assistant instrument (noted in one frame) does not change the overall strategy but facilitates regripping and tension management when needed.

Tissue handling and wound edge apposition
Forceps are used sparingly but effectively to evert and present the dermal margin for needle exit. The bites are consistently placed to achieve slight eversion of the edges, which helps approximate the dermis without inversion or excessive tension. After knot seating, the wound edges are observed to meet with no visible gapping and without crush injury; manipulation is purposeful and protective of tissue integrity.

Consistency and quality of closure
The technique remains consistent across the entire case: measured, perpendicular needle entries with symmetric exits, instrument ties producing square knots, and trimming of the tails following securement. The operator repeatedly uses the same workflow—drive the needle through one edge, follow the curvature to the opposite edge, draw suture through, park or reorient the needle as needed, perform instrument-mediated throws, seat the knot, then proceed to the next bite. The suture material is managed so that loops and tails are controlled anteriorly and kept away from adjacent unused incisions.

Final state of the wound
At completion the midline incision is closed with individually secured interrupted sutures. Knots are centralized over the wound line and appear square and well-seated; edges are approximated with slight eversion and no visible gapping. Suture tails have been trimmed in the final frames, leaving short ends adjacent to the knot. Surrounding, unused slits on the pad remain undisturbed. The overall closure demonstrates consistent technique and attention to tissue handling, resulting in a cleanly approximated linear closure suitable for secure apposition while minimizing potential inversion or undue tension.

Notes on inconsistent frame labeling
As noted at the outset, some frame annotations referred to various numbered slits (second from left, third from left, rightmost of four). These differences likely reflect labeling or viewpoint changes in the source descriptions rather than true switching between multiple wounds. The operative narrative above follows a single midline incision throughout; where discrepancies appeared, they were treated as alternate descriptions of the same line and are reflected in the caveat at the start of this narrative. Overall, the recorded actions cohere to a single, continuous suturing session along one vertical linear incision, progressing from initial bites through sequential instrument ties to final trimming and completion.
