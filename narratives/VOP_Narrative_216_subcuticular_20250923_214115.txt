COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a brief prelude on a neighboring practice cut before the main closure proceeds on the midline wound for the remainder of the case. In this opening sequence, the operator works on the leftmost of three parallel vertical slits on the pad, targeting the two inked bite points on that line. With the needle driver in the left hand and tissue forceps in the right, the near edge is lifted and everted to expose the dermal layer. The curved needle is held about two-thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin, and is driven in a smooth arc through the near edge and across to the far edge at symmetric setbacks. The suture trails to the left, away from the untouched central and right incisions. Immediately afterward, the same short left-sided incision is tied. The needle remains clamped in the driver while the other hand uses pickups to steady the tissue and manage the short tail. Alternating instrument throws are formed around the driver and seated down centrally over the slit while maintaining slight eversion at the lower inked dot. This vignette completes a single stitch on the side slit and serves as a quick demonstration of needle control and instrument tying technique.

The work then shifts and remains for the remainder of the procedure on the central vertical incision, a straight midline cut flanked by two parallel slits and marked by guide dots. At first, attention centers over its midpoint where a single stitch has been placed and still needs to be secured. The needle is not being driven; it is parked on the long strand off to the left while the right-hand needle driver works directly over the wound to complete the knot. The left hand controls the tail, delivering it to the driver as needed so that alternating, square throws are formed and cinched. The operator keeps both strands symmetric across the wound and draws them down toward the incision so the knot seats flat at the center without twisting the edges.

Once that central knot is set, the driver re-grasps and reloads the needle. The left hand keeps the needle perpendicular to the skin and, after tying, reorients it vertically above the incision near the inked central marks. The right hand alternates between controlling the free limb for tension and bringing in pickups to evert the wound edges. The edges are drawn together evenly with slight eversion while the operator aligns the next pass.

A second tying sequence follows over the central portion: the needle remains attached to the working limb as the driver is used to perform instrument ties, tightening multiple throws while the right hand stabilizes both the suture and the skin edge. As these early central knots are completed, the operator keeps the suture loop neatly centered, bringing the ends down evenly so tissue approximation remains symmetric and gentle.

With preparation complete, the operator begins placing additional stitches along the central line. The driver—most often in the left hand—approaches from the left side while the right-hand Adson forceps pick up the right dermal edge. The needle is consistently held at its proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin surface. For the next pass, the right wound edge is tented and everted, then the needle arcs through at an even depth before crossing the incision to the opposite margin. The suture is organized to trail superiorly, out of the field. No tying is shown within these moments; the focus is on precise needle passage.

Subsequent frames show the needle traversing both sides in the same controlled manner, the forceps alternating to whichever side is being pierced to ensure eversion, consistent depth, and symmetric setbacks from the cut edge. The driver retrieves and repositions the needle to complete the opposing bite, then draws the thread through. The hands meet within millimeters over the midline, maintaining a perpendicular needle path and clean alignment.

At this stage another stitch is formalized at the center. The driver works over the left side and the forceps on the right elevate the dermis right at the proposed entry site. The needle arcs from left to right, then, once both bites are taken, two instruments oppose one another over the incision to execute an instrument tie. Multiple throws are alternated and brought down to the wound, and the knot is seated directly over the midline. Consistency features here: each bite is a few millimeters from the edge, taken perpendicular to the cut, with tension applied just enough to approximate without blanching or strangulation.

The operator then drops inferiorly on the central wound to address the lower third, where the edges gape most. With the needle driver held in the left hand and forceps in the right, the left dermis is entered at an appropriate setback and the pass is guided across to the right. The right-hand forceps provide counter-traction and eversion on whichever edge is traversed at that moment, minimizing crush by holding only the dermal margin. The suture arc is clean and controlled, and although no knot is placed in that moment, the staging clearly sets up for another interrupted stitch.

Work then climbs into the upper half. A midline knot is already present, and a new stitch is being placed superior to it, advancing the closure proximally. At times the right hand substitutes a small skin hook for the forceps to lift the right edge and maintain eversion, while the left-hand driver advances the curved needle from the operator’s left to right, following the needle’s curvature across the wound. The technique remains consistent in bite width, depth, and perpendicular alignment.

Another stitch in the upper half is both passed and tied. The needle is grasped at the proximal third-to-midcurve and passed across the wound after careful eversion. After passage, both hands switch to drivers to perform instrument ties, laying multiple throws and finalizing a secure knot that sits slightly off-center—still adequately coapting the edges. This minor lateral offset is acceptable and does not compromise approximation.

Progress continues with another arcing pass: the left-hand driver remains on the operator’s left side while the right-hand pickups alternate sides to evert whichever edge is being pierced or exited. The needle advances forehand across the midline, and the suture loop forms superiorly without cluttering the field. No knot is shown here as the operator concentrates on the accuracy of the passage.

A rhythm establishes: one stitch is passed and tightened at mid-incision; the slack is pulled through; the needle is reloaded to set up the next bite, moving sequentially along the same central wound. The forceps consistently present the dermis at each bite site, and the driver crosses the incision at approximately 90 degrees, keeping the needle perpendicular to the skin surface. Full-thickness or near full-thickness dermal bites are taken with gentle traction so the edges are brought together with slight eversion. After the thread is drawn through, a knot is formed and seated, adding to the growing series along the line. Preparations begin immediately for the next stitch just superior to the newly secured knot.

As the closure approaches the superior third, the operator’s control of the suture becomes even more deliberate. The free suture loop is kept arcing superiorly and away from the wound, minimizing tangles. The right hand lifts and everts the right margin at the wound apex while the left hand holds the driver over the left side. The needle remains oriented perpendicular to the skin and is poised to enter; instruments oppose one another across the incision a few millimeters from the cut, maintaining a clean working corridor.

A previous pass is brought taut near the top, then the next stitch is prepared and placed in the same midline segment. The needle is re-grasped after pull-through to maintain control of the curve and then reoriented for the subsequent bite. The forceps continue to lift the dermal edges to ensure eversion; suture tension is modulated so approximation is firm but not overly tight.

Now uniquely, the right hand takes the needle driver while the left hand uses the pickups. From this stance, a high pass at the superior end is executed right-to-left. The left-hand forceps evert the near edge and briefly stabilize the far side for exit. The bites are symmetric, and the pass closes the gap with measured tension. The thread exits superiorly and is kept lateral to avoid crossing the field.

The next brief sequence is devoted to securing this top segment: the driver manipulates the strand to complete a knot at the superior end of the existing stitch line. The forceps steady the right wound edge near the apex; eversion is maintained. The instrument throws are formed and snugged, locking the most recent pass before proceeding upward.

Near the superior third, the operator repeats the fundamental pattern with tight coordination. The left hand holds the driver from the left side and the right hand controls the forceps at the edge just above the most recent stitch. On one pass a second driver briefly assists so the needle can be regripped and drawn through in a smooth arc. The new loop is tensioned to sit snugly against the previous stitch, effectively advancing the closure cranially with controlled spacing. The suture strand is kept to the operator’s right, out of the working view.

Another bite is set at this superior neighborhood: the driver pronates to drive the needle through a gently everted right edge while the forceps help present the tissue. The pass is perpendicular to the incision, and the edges draw together without excess tension, maintaining a straight column of approximated skin. Immediately afterward, a tightening and locking step is performed at the most recent superior stitch, after which the needle is repositioned for the next pass adjacent to it. The suture strand remains under meticulous control, directed superiorly to keep the field clear.

At the very top of the wound, the closure is now being secured stitch-by-stitch. The left-hand driver works along the upper left rim of the incision while the right hand alternates between pickups and a second driver. Using an instrument tie technique, the operator wraps and grasps the free end, alternating throws to seat a balanced knot centrally over the wound margins. The right tool manages the free strand as the left driver forms the loops, and the knot is cinched down squarely across the wound. This sequence repeats once more at the apex: a recent stitch is secured with multiple throws, the edges are held in a gentle eversion with the forceps, and tightening is symmetric to avoid twisting the line or flattening the wound margins.

At this stage, several prior bites approximate the edges from inferior to superior. One more high pass is taken to close the remaining small gap at the apex. The right-hand driver holds the needle two-thirds from the tip and rotates the wrist to drive it across the top segment while the left hand—alternating between forceps and index finger—controls the near edge and the strand to prevent drag. The loop is formed and tightened with disciplined tension so the stitch seats and the edges coapt without gapping or strangulation. The driver regrasp of the needle maintains control as the line advances to its final position.

Immediately above, a lock is created on the most recent pass and the line is tensioned. In one sequence, the operator uses the driver to present the needle perpendicular to the skin, then parks the needle momentarily while loops are formed and tightened. The forceps provide light stabilization at the superior edges, but the partially completed column of stitches already holds eversion, allowing minimal tissue handling. The hands work opposite each other just above the superior third of the wound, parallel to the incision and centered over the axis of closure.

Final preparation at the apex is deliberate. The left hand holds a needle driver approaching from the upper left toward the incision apex while the right hand alternates between controlling the strand and using tissue forceps to evert the right wound edge. The curved needle, still held roughly two-thirds from the tip, is oriented perpendicular and aligned to penetrate the right edge at the very top. Gentle traction on the free strand keeps the field open, removes slack, and clarifies the bite path. Instruments bracket the incision cleanly, tips nearly meeting over the centerline.

With the last gap closed, there are no further tissue passes. The operator completes the final knot throws on the existing top stitch. At first, a driver holds the strand to execute the throws; then two instruments are used together to lay alternating, balanced loops. In the final frames, both hands come off instruments and adjust the tension directly on the strands, drawing the knot down centrally over the apex and evening out the eversion on both sides. No tail trimming is clearly shown, but the tie is firm and neatly seated.

Across the entire closure, several technical themes are consistent. The needle is always controlled at its proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, with entry perpendicular to the skin to avoid skiving. The driver frequently regrips the needle after partial passage so the arc can be completed without excessive torque. The assisting hand presents tissue using Adson forceps or occasionally a skin hook, grasping the dermal margin lightly to maintain eversion and visualization without crushing. Each bite mirrors the last—taken a few millimeters from the cut edge, at even depth, and directed straight across to the opposing side—resulting in uniform, symmetric approximation. The strand is actively managed throughout: it is arced superiorly or laterally out of the field to avoid tangles, kept taut to maintain working space, and guided with the assisting hand to minimize tissue drag. Knotting is performed with instrument ties, forming alternating throws and laying them flat so the knot seats over the incision without tilting the edges. In a few moments, locking steps are used while tightening to hold tension while the next motion is set up, but each stitch is ultimately secured with deliberate throws before moving on.

Spatially, the operator’s hands nearly always oppose each other across the wound. When the driver is in the left hand, the forceps occupy the right side and vice versa. The tips meet within millimeters of the incision line, creating a controlled, perpendicular needle trajectory and precise entry/exit points aligned with guide dots where present. As the closure progresses superiorly, the suture loop is kept superior to the active bite and the prior stitches form a straight, orderly column down the midline. In the uppermost third, the hands occasionally switch roles—right-hand driver with left-hand pickups—to accommodate angle and visibility, but the principles persist: perpendicular entry, even depth, slight eversion, and measured tension.

By the end of the sequence, the midline incision is fully approximated from the lower third up to the apex with a series of carefully spaced, secure stitches. The edges meet neatly with a slight outward roll, producing the desired eversion. The knots—most of them seated directly over the incision and one slightly off to the side—lie flat without cutting into the synthetic skin. Mild puckering is visible adjacent to some throws, which is typical of well-tensioned skin closure on a synthetic pad. The final top knot is tightened and adjusted with both hands to equalize tension, leaving a straight, well-aligned closure that is ready for tail trimming and dressing.
