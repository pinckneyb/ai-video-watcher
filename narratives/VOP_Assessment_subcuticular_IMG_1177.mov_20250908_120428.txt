Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
This assessment focuses on the long central vertical incision from 0â€“134 s as the active suture line with progressive placement. The work shows deliberate, organized laddering with competent hand opposition: the left hand maintains eversion while the right hand drives the needle in a controlled arc, then transitions smoothly into tying. Instrument handling is disciplined, with minimal off-field excursions and coherent suture management, which supports a steady rhythm.
