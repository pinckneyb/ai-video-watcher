COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
At the start of the recording the team focuses on the short vertical laceration located in the lower center region of the pad — the clean linear wound situated between the two longer lateral slits. The sequence that follows is a methodical placement of interrupted skin sutures along that same short vertical cut, beginning at the inferior apex and progressing upward as repairs are completed and secured. Throughout the case one needle, one suture line and a consistent working relationship between a needle driver and tissue forceps govern the actions, producing repeated cycles of bite-taking, suture passage, knot formation, and tail trimming until the wound is approximated along its length.

Initial approach and first bites (0.0–44.0 s)
Work begins at the inferior end of the lower‑central slit. Instruments are triangulated around the wound: the needle driver is held in the operator’s left hand and approaches from the left/inferior side, while the right hand uses tissue forceps to present and evert the right wound edge. The curved needle is grasped approximately at the junction of the proximal and middle third of its arc and oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin. The first pass is delivered as an outside‑in bite on the right edge at the inferior corner, then the needle is rotated through its arc and driven across the wound to exit the left edge. Forceps briefly switch sides to maintain eversion as the needle is pulled through, producing a suture loop that spans the gap. Entry and exit are symmetric and placed just a few millimeters from the epidermal margin, with gentle traction and minimal tissue crush. The instruments remain opposed across the wound and are careful to keep the suture loop off the field so it does not obstruct subsequent bites.

After the first pass a second stitch is initiated at a neighboring inferior point. The driver is regrasped as needed to optimize needle angle (commonly regrasped about two-thirds from the tip in these early passes), and the forceps repeatedly lift and evert the dermal margins. With each delivery the needle follows an arcuate trajectory that approximates dermal purchase without penetrating overly deep or catching excess material. Approximately one minute into the procedure the right hand intermittently tensions the suture strand to clear loops while the left hand repositions the driver for the next bite.

Rhythm develops — repeat passes and loop management (45.0–104.0 s)
As the session proceeds the operator establishes a steady pattern: needle passages from left-to-right across the slit with forceps on the right for edge control; short, controlled draws of suture through the tissue; and preparation for the reciprocal bite. At times the operator takes a bite at a slightly more superior point on the same vertical line, regripping the needle at different locations along its shaft — sometimes at the proximal third, sometimes around the midpoint — to optimize trajectory and leverage. The tissue handling remains conservative and deliberate: forceps are used to tent the epidermal edge for eversion, preventing inversion of the wound and ensuring the dermal bite beds anchor the closure.

When bites are completed, the suture is drawn through and held in readiness for knot tying. On occasions the assistant switches briefly to scissors to trim tails after secure throws are completed; these scissor approaches occur with blades oriented a few millimeters above the skin, making light contact to snip excess tail and leave a short, tidy knot.

A completed stitch is tied and secured (105.0–164.0 s)
Once both bites for a given interrupted stitch have been taken and the suture drawn through, attention turns to securing the stitch with instrument ties. The driver often serves as the post for instrument ties: the standing suture is looped around the driver and the short tail is grasped, or the driver holds the short end while the opposing hand manipulates the long end to form throws. Hands cross over the incision during this tying choreography — the left-hand driver acting as the anchor while the right hand crosses medially to pull the free end and seat throws. This exchange is repeated to produce locking throws; the technique is consistent with instrument-tied interrupted sutures and avoids excessive bulk on the skin surface.

Throughout these tying phases the wound edges are approximated by suture tension alone; forceps release once the knot is seated. The operator pays attention to edge alignment and avoids crushing the tissue during knot advancement. After seating the knot, scissors are introduced to trim the tails, approaching from the right or left depending on the stitch location and surgeon preference. Throughout, the driver is used not only to place bites but also to pick up loops and manipulate suture during knot formation when needed, sometimes holding the needle briefly near the swage-to-body junction as the stitch sequence continues.

Progression superiorly and repeated cycles (165.0–224.0 s)
The workflow advances superiorly along the same vertical line. Each new pass follows the same principles: the driver approaches from the patient’s left and delivers the curved needle in an arc perpendicular to the skin surface; the forceps on the right lift and evert the dermal lip to allow a symmetric bite. The needle is regularly regrasped to maintain an optimal driving angle and to follow the curvature through both edges at approximately equal depths and distances from the margin (commonly around 2–3 mm). After passage the suture is drawn through and the stitch is prepared for securing; instrument ties are again formed with the driver acting as the post while the opposing hand crosses and directs the tail to achieve snug throws. The operator alternates between driving the needle, tensioning loops, and completing ties so that the wound is closed in a controlled sequential manner.

At times the driver is used to secure loops or to hold the needle off to the side while the free end is manipulated; during these intervals the right hand momentarily handles suture ends or introduces scissors to trim completed knots. The suture technique remains consistent: full-thickness dermal bites that produce good apposition without eversion failure or skin puckering beyond a small, expected degree. The tissue is handled gently; forceps apply light traction to present the bite site and do not crush or compress the wound margins.

Knot formation and refinement (195.0–239.0 s)
As the operator reaches the superior portion of the same vertical slit, several stitches that were passed earlier are now being locked down. The sequence shows the driver holding and wrapping suture strands to create a secure knot while the assistant or the other hand pulls the free segment to seat each throw. In these frames the driver is often held over the knot site with the needle tip pointing away from the wound as the loops are wrapped and tightened. The hands cross over the wound during this choreography, and the left hand alternates between holding the driver and bringing in scissors to trim tails as soon as knots are secure. Scissors are introduced from the left in some episodes to snip tails; in other episodes a right-sided approach is used to make the final cut. The completed segment of the wound begins to show continuous approximated edges with small puckering and a visible knot at the superior portion of the slit.

Intermittent pauses, assessment and field management (240.0–264.0 s)
Later in the sequence the operator pauses briefly to assess the repair. One hand approaches with scissor tips over the closed portion of the slit, touching lightly to the knot area in what appears to be final trimming or trimming rehearsal. During a short interval there are frames where no needle is visible and only a single hand with scissors is active, indicating a cleanup or inspection phase. At another interval, instruments and hands are absent from the field for several frames while one previously placed stitch remains in place along the oblique upper-left slit (that cut is not being worked on and thus remains static); in those frames the suture strand crossing the lower-central slit remains intact and tensioned but no active bites or throws are executed. Later still, the team returns briefly to the lower-central wound to finalize any remaining knots and to trim tails as needed.

Technique attributes and consistency throughout the case
Across the entire timeline the repair technique is remarkably consistent. The same basic method — interrupted simple sutures with instrument-tied throws — is repeatedly employed. The operator consistently uses a curved needle held anywhere from the proximal third to the midpoint or two-thirds from the tip depending on the desired angle; positioning the driver to present the needle nearly orthogonally to the skin facilitates predictable entry and exit points. Forceps are routinely used to evert and stabilize the dermal margin on the side opposite the driver so that bites are symmetric in depth and distance from the epidermal edge.

As stitches are formed, the sutures approximate the dermis without excessive tension. Knot-tying technique is predominantly instrument-based, using the driver as a post and performing successive throws to seat secure knots. The hands frequently cross over the incision to manage suture tails and to maintain even tension on each throw. Scissors are used intermittently to trim tails close to the knots, leaving short ends and reducing bulk. There is no abrupt change in method: the operator maintains the same principles from the first pass at the inferior apex through to the final knots at the superior end.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
At the outset the left hand consistently carries the needle driver and approaches the wound from the patient’s left or lower-left, while the right hand controls forceps and works from the right or superior-right. This opposition creates a stable working corridor directly over the slit. During needle passage the driver sits slightly inferior or lateral to the incision and drives the needle across an orthogonal plane; the forceps elevate and evert the opposing edge to present dermal tissue. After the needle exits and the suture is drawn through, the left hand frequently converts the driver to become the post for instrument ties; the right hand then crosses over the wound to wrap and pull the free end. As tying progresses the hands may transiently swap roles or bring in scissors for trimming; at all times they work in close proximity to the same vertical line with minimal extraneous motion.

When the team needs to adjust needle grip or trajectory, the needle is regrasped at different points along its body so the driver can optimize the angle of attack without changing the hand’s general position relative to the wound. Occasionally the right hand moves to take up or manage suture loops and then returns to forceps for the next bite, maintaining an efficient left-to-right rhythm. During knot-tying phases the hands cross and uncross over the incision while a careful, balanced pull secures each throw and preserves approximation.

Final appearance and state of the repair
By the end of the recording the lower‑central vertical slit is closed along its length with a series of interrupted stitches that bring the wound edges into close apposition. Edges are approximated with slight expected puckering at each stitch site and tidy knots sitting above the skin surface. Suture tails have been trimmed close to the knots in the cleanup phases. There is no evidence of crushed or devitalized tissue at the bite sites; bites were placed at symmetric depth and distance from the margins, producing consistent alignment without undue tension. A brief pause in activity and a momentary absence of hands indicate a final inspection; subsequent gentle scissor contact suggests final trimming and refinement of knots.

Notes on limitations and brief nonworking intervals
On a few short spans within the recording hands and instruments leave the field or the needle is parked off-screen; during those periods the suture across the lower central slit remains static and secure but no new bites or throws are made. One later frame documents an oblique upper-left laceration with a suture strand lying within it; this incision is not actively manipulated and does not alter the focus on the lower-central repair. These moments do not alter the continuity of attention to the central lower slit, which is the single line methodically repaired in sequential interrupted passes.

Overall, the procedure demonstrates a textbook, reproducible approach to closing a short vertical skin laceration: careful triangular instrument orientation, perpendicular needle presentation, symmetric dermal bites with eversion by forceps, instrument-tied interrupted knots using the driver as a post, and tidy tail trimming — repeated in a controlled, systematic progression from inferior to superior until the wound is fully approximated and the field is cleaned and inspected.
