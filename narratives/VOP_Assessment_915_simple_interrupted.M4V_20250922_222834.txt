COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a multi‑incision silicone practice pad, but all operative effort is concentrated on one wound on the left side of the field. Its apparent orientation and relative position shift slightly as the pad and camera are repositioned—at moments it reads as the second slit from the left, briefly appears oblique, and later even looks horizontal—yet the work consistently tracks the same cutaneous defect. The operator develops a continuous running skin closure along this line, beginning with an anchor and then advancing the run in a measured, methodical fashion with careful tissue handling and precise needle control.

The opening sequence begins with controlled entry planning and the first passes at the left‑side wound. The needle is loaded close to the proximal third to mid‑body, with the jaws perpendicular to the curve to preserve needle integrity, and the approach is perpendicular to the skin surface to capture a healthy vertical bite of the dermis. The non‑driving hand—using fine Adson/Brown or blue‑handled tissue forceps—lifts and everts the wound edge just at the dermal–epidermal junction. The forceps work tip‑only, avoiding crush injury, and the operator aims consistent bite spacing near the center of the open segment. With wrist pronation, the driver advances the curved needle in a smooth arc through the near edge and out the far edge. Early frames show this sequence repeated to establish the initial stitch and bring the suture through; the emerging strand is managed to the side to keep the field clear.

With the first pass completed, the operator establishes the anchor for the running line. The suture tails are balanced, the wound edges are held in light eversion, and instrument ties are laid down adjacent to the wound edge. Multiple throws are applied to secure the anchor without strangulating the skin; once seated, the short tail is cut. This explains the early appearance of a knot and trimmed ends low on the wound while the needle and long working strand remain in play for the run. Through these early stages, hand dominance and approach angles vary slightly—at one moment the driver is in the left hand approaching from the operator’s left; later, the driver is in the right hand, reflecting comfortable ambidexterity and the need to keep the needle arc perpendicular as the pad is rotated. The forceps consistently oppose the driver across the wound, presenting the far edge during each pass and then switching sides as the needle traverses to maintain exposure and traction.

Once the anchor is secure, the running closure begins in earnest. The driver is repeatedly reloaded at the proximal third of the needle, jaws near perpendicular to the curve, with meticulous attention to the needle’s arc so it follows its curvature through the synthetic dermis rather than being torqued or levered. The assisting hand steadies the opposite edge, everting just enough to present a clean entry point and, after the needle tip emerges, uses the pickups to grasp the body of the needle or the suture to “follow” it through the tissue while protecting the bite width. Movements are compact and controlled, with the instruments kept within a few millimeters of the wound edges. The suture loops are drawn snug but not tight, just enough to coapt the epidermal edges and maintain slight eversion along the advancing line.

As the run progresses, there are brief interludes of housekeeping and setup that mark a careful, deliberate technique. At one stage the operator clears the field with a small swab and briefly pauses to inspect approximation and tension. On more than one occasion, scissors are brought in to trim a short tag close to a prior knot stack—consistent with removing excess from the anchor or a locking step in the run—while the long working strand and needle remain secured in the driver. The needle is then promptly reloaded with the curve oriented perpendicular to the incision and the next pass is planned. These pauses do not interrupt the continuity of the closure; instead, they keep the line orderly and prevent suture tangles as the run advances.

Midway through the procedure, the incision’s apparent orientation changes in the frame, momentarily appearing oblique and later horizontal. Despite this change in view, the operative choreography remains consistent: the driver positions the needle at 90 degrees to the skin, the forceps gently evert the presented edge, and each pass mirrors the one before it. In one segment the surgeon briefly opens a new suture packet and reloads a fresh needle at the proximal third, then resumes the same run along the same wound, maintaining the prior spacing and depth. Throughout, the suture is managed carefully—kept lateral to the field and kept from looping around instruments—so that each new loop lays flat against the skin and supports even, progressive edge approximation.

As the line fills in, precision increases. Bites are taken at consistent distances from the wound margin, symmetrically on both sides, maintaining a uniform “railroad track” appearance of the crossings without smothering the epidermal edge. The assisting hand alternates sides in a reliable pattern: it lifts the near edge as the needle approaches, then, once the tip exits, it transfers its attention to the opposite edge for the next pass, crossing under the driver smoothly to avoid losing orientation. Where the pad’s surface contains earlier practice marks and knots nearby, the operator confines all active manipulation to the chosen wound, ignoring parallel slits to the right and working in a narrow corridor directly over the target line. Several frames show minor repositioning or reloading without a pass; these moments are used to refine angle, adjust needle bite depth, or correct hand spacing so the arc travels smoothly through the dermis rather than skiving or cutting through.

Later sequences clearly depict the hallmark of a continuous run: a contiguous line of loops already coapting the wound edges while the needle is repositioned for the next bite. The forceps gently lift each margin before needle entry and again just after exit to allow the surgeon to follow the needle with minimal tissue drag. The driver remains close to the wound, and the needle is grasped consistently near its mid‑to‑proximal third to maximize control while preserving the curvature and preventing forces that would bend the needle. The suture is advanced distally along the incision, loop by loop. Where earlier descriptions mention “interrupted stitches,” those likely reflect the anchor at the start of the run and small trimmed tags along the line rather than true isolated closures; the operative sequence itself remains consistent with a running technique throughout.

At the superior end of the wound, the final gaps are approached with the same discipline as the earlier passes. The operator continues the sequence of near‑to‑far and far‑to‑near arcs, with the needle tip entering perpendicular to the skin surface and exiting at matching distances from the margin. Edge eversion is maintained, and there is no aggressive spreading or undermining—just precise, shallow dermal purchases that bring the epidermal planes into alignment. With each pass, the advancing suture is gently tensioned along the line so that prior loops sit neatly and do not constrict the skin; this habit prevents staircase deformities and preserves perfusion at the wound edge.

With the wound now essentially approximated along its entire length, attention turns to ending the run. Frames show the driver holding the needle parked at the proximal end, while the other hand uses forceps to stabilize the tissue and to control the free strand in preparation for terminal throws. The operator locks the terminal portion of the running line, tightening and seating the final loops so that tension is evenly distributed and no segment is left slack. Instrument ties are then constructed at the wound edge. As with the anchor, multiple square throws are laid down cleanly, alternating direction to lock the knot stack while keeping it compact and flush with the skin surface. During these steps the hands sometimes cross over the incision as the right hand pulls laterally on the free end to set the throw and the left hand, with the driver, supports the knot so it seats precisely where intended.

Following securement of the end knot, there is a careful inspection and tidying pass along the run. Scissors are brought in to trim terminal tails, and forceps briefly stabilize knots while the trimming is done flush but not so close as to risk unraveling. Any short, extraneous tag from earlier locking steps is also cut back to neaten the field. The wound edges remain approximated with slight, deliberate eversion along the entire length of the closure, and the loops are evenly spaced. In some late frames the operator reloads the needle and positions it over the closed line as though preparing for an additional reinforcing bite. This preparation likely reflects a readiness to add a final pass if a tiny residual gap or tension point were seen at the margin; the field, however, already shows a continuous, satisfactorily coapted line with no gaping, and no additional penetration is captured at that instant.

Throughout the case, the evolution of the surgeon’s hand positions shows a consistent, practiced pattern adapted to the anatomy of the wound and the orientation of the pad. The driver hand stays close to the wound and is alternated between left and right as needed to preserve a perpendicular needle approach; the assisting hand’s pickups present and evert the edges with minimal trauma. When scissors are needed, they are brought in briefly, always with the non‑working instruments parked safely away from the field to avoid accidental cuts or contamination of the strand. On occasion a swab passes across the line to clear debris or suture ink; this is done gently and away from the entry/exit points so as not to disrupt approximation. Reloading of the needle is performed frequently but efficiently: the driver grips the needle at a consistent position, the jaw angle is corrected to avoid twisting, and the needle tip is oriented to enter at predictable right angles to the skin.

Spatially, the instruments maintain a narrow working corridor straddling the wound. The driver approaches from one side while the forceps oppose from the other, converging over the incision. As each bite is completed, the hands trade roles and positions to maintain this mirrored geometry and keep the needle’s arc true to its curvature. Loops are directed along the line, and the free strand is managed laterally so it doesn’t snag on forceps teeth or the driver’s hinge. Even when the camera pans, the pad rotates, or the operator changes stance—producing descriptors of “leftmost vertical,” “second from left,” “oblique,” or “horizontal”—the choreography of needle‑forceps opposition and the perpendicularly oriented bites remains constant. This consistency is the signature of a single, continuous running cutaneous closure executed along one wound.

By the end of the procedure, the wound edges are uniformly approximated with a continuous line of evenly spaced passes, displaying slight, healthy eversion and precise edge alignment. The start of the run is anchored with a compact knot and trimmed tag; the terminal end is locked and tied securely with tails trimmed to a modest length. No dog‑ears or gaps remain along the line. The surrounding practice slits on the pad are untouched, save for occasional momentary appearances in the periphery, underscoring that the surgeon’s attention never strays from this single closure. In sum, the case demonstrates a controlled, continuous running skin closure: a clean anchor, sequential perpendicular bites with atraumatic edge handling, thoughtful management of suture tension and direction, a secure termination, and a final inspection with minor trimming—all culminating in a neat, robustly approximated skin line. Where some frames show midline tails or isolated trimming, these reflect anchor and terminal management within the running construct rather than a change of technique; the through‑line of the operation remains a continuous run along a single left‑side wound from start to finish.
