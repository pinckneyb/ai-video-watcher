COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator establishing control over the right‑central vertical incision column on the practice pad and proceeds as a methodical sequence of interrupted skin closures working along that single incision from one end toward the other. From the first frames the operator favors a consistent approach: a curved, swaged needle is gripped in a needle‑holding instrument and delivered in controlled arcs while a second hand (either with forceps or bare fingertips) stabilizes, tents and slightly everts the opposing dermal edge. Instruments and hands repeatedly cross and oppose one another over the same linear defect, creating a tightly coordinated, small working field.

Initial passes and bite technique
At the outset the surgeon approaches the superior portion of the vertical right‑side slit. The right hand commonly carries the needle‑holder and the left hand provides counter‑traction or tissue control, although these roles alternate in different frames depending on approach angle. The needle is almost always grasped away from the very tip — typically mid‑shaft or roughly one‑third to two‑thirds along the curvature — giving firm control for a predictable arc through the dermal substrate. Needle orientation varies between perpendicular and oblique, but the motion is a regular rotation through the tissue, with the convex curve of the needle describing a smooth through‑and‑through pass from near to far edge. Where the anatomy (simulator slits and orientation) requires, the driver approaches from above/left and the counter instrument from the right/bottom or vice‑versa; the hands meet over the wound with only a few centimetres separating tips, enabling a precise bite.

Tissue handling on every pass emphasizes gentle approximation rather than aggressive eversion or undermining. The assistant hand — either forceps or bare fingertips — tents and pins the near edge, elevating it slightly to allow full‑thickness dermal purchase with minimal crush. Bites are consistently shallow to mid‑dermal on the synthetic pad, reflecting a simple interrupted skin closure practice. The operator draws suture through smoothly after each pass, checks edge apposition and readies the suture for instrument or manual knotting.

Progression from needle passes to knot‑securing
After the initial needle passes are completed, the operator transitions to securing each stitch with instrument ties and occasional manual assistance. Early frames show needle entry and pull‑throughs with the suture tail routed laterally; subsequent frames show knot formation using the needle‑driver and forceps — the needle driver often regrips the suture near the bite site to perform instrument ties, while the opposite hand keeps gentle tension on the free end. These ties are performed with short, controlled throws; the operator favors instrument ties rather than long hand‑throws on this model.

Throughout the mid‑sequence the pattern becomes unmistakably iterative: repeat needle pass, pull suture through, approximate edges, instrument‑tie and tighten, manage tails (often trimming occurs outside the captured frames or after a short series). On several occasions the operator uses bare gloved fingers to apply final fingertip traction and to evert margins subtly while tightening the knot, an economy of motion that reduces instrument exchanges. In many frames the needle is repositioned and grasped at a consistent mid‑shaft location for each bite, supporting a reproducible curvature and penetration depth.

Spatial choreography and hand evolution
Hands and instruments maintain a tight choreography across the recording. The needle‑driver alternates approaches from above/left or top/left while forceps or the opposing hand approach from the right/caudal or right/lateral aspect; this crossing configuration allows the needle to be guided through the far and near edges in a stable, opposing manner. Separations between instrument tips commonly range between approximately 1–4 cm; the working geometry is compact and centered directly over the incision. As suturing progresses, the surgeon demonstrates smooth hand alternation: some bites are delivered with the left hand as needle driver and right hand as forceps, while others invert that relationship. The choice seems driven by small variations in incision location and ergonomics rather than by any change in technique.

Over time there is a subtle shift toward using bare fingers more frequently for final approximation and tension control in preference to always holding forceps. In earlier passes the non‑needle hand commonly uses toothed forceps to grasp and evert the edge; in later passes the operator increasingly uses fingertip traction to seat the stitch and apply counter‑tension while the needle driver performs the instrument ties. This change streamlines knot tightening and aligns the suture tails for trimming.

Continuity and sequential placement along the column
The surgeon advances in a cranio‑caudal (or caudo‑cranial in some passes) progression along the right‑central vertical slit, placing interrupted stitches sequentially adjacent to previously tied knots. Multiple frames show completed interrupted sutures inferior to the working site while the operator places a new bite immediately superior to them, then repeats the pattern. The spacing between bites is consistent and measured, producing an even line of approximating points. At times several tied stitches are visible along the length of the incision as the operator works at the superior or inferior ends to extend the closure; in other shots the needle is being inserted into a fresh gap just beyond an existing row of stitches.

Needle handling details and minor visibility limitations
Needle grip tends to be mid‑shaft for most deliveries; occasionally the driver grips slightly closer to the tip for a delicate entrance. The needle path is a controlled arc, and the operator frequently readjusts the holder to optimize tip orientation before penetration. One minor limitation noted during the mid‑procedure is intermittent obscuration of the needle tip (some frames show the tip hidden behind instruments or fingertips), which momentarily complicates precise assessment of depth; despite that, the operator consistently achieves proper through‑and‑through purchase. The motions remain deliberate and steady, with the driver advancing and rotating, and the opposing forceps or fingers stabilizing and everting.

Variations in approach for different local segments
Although the conceptual technique — simple interrupted suturing with instrument ties — remains constant, the operator adapts small technical details to local geometry. On shorter stellate or oblique portions of the vertical column, the needle is presented at a slightly more perpendicular angle to achieve symmetric edge bites. Where the incision runs more longitudinally, the needle trajectory is oblique and the forceps may tent more aggressively to obtain adequate dermal capture. In one sequence a more horizontal orientation is recorded; this reflects the local segment geometry rather than any change in overall closure plan. Throughout, bites remain superficial to mid‑dermal, with intentional avoidance of deep tissue bunching.

Knotting technique and suture management
Once each pass is drawn, the operator secures the stitch using instrument ties. The needle driver is repurposed to manipulate the suture strand, and the forceps or fingers maintain counter‑tension on the opposite tail. Knots are snugged down, producing slight eversion of the epidermal edges. The operator habitually repositions and orients suture tails away from the wound after tying, preparing the field for the subsequent pass. In many frames the operator trims tail lengths and readjusts existing knots to equalize tension and ensure a smooth line of approximation. Where multiple stitches lie in proximity, the hands space knots to avoid overlapping tails and to preserve regular wound geometry.

Increasing efficiency and refinement
As the case proceeds the workflow becomes more economical. Early passes require more instrument adjustments and repositioning; later passes show more direct needle deliveries with fewer repositioning gestures. The operator’s left/right hand alternation seems to become more anticipatory: the non‑needle hand positions the edge and routes the suture tail slightly in advance, and the needle driver comes into the ideal plane for an uninterrupted pass. The overall cadence becomes a rhythmic set of needle pass—pull—tie—trim—move to next site.

Final consolidation and inspection
Near the end of the recorded sequence the column of interrupted closures is complete along the worked segment. The final passes are tied down and the operator uses fingertips to seat the knots and assess edge apposition. In the last visible frames the instruments are withdrawn and a clean row of evenly spaced interrupted sutures runs along the length of the original slit. The tokens of completion are clear: tied knots lie centrally over each bite, the epidermal margins are approximated with slight eversion, and suture tails project briefly cranially from the most superior knot in some frames. In the very last stills the operator has stepped back from the field; no instruments are in contact with the pad and the wound appears closed along the worked column.

Appearance of the completed closure
The closure line appears uniform, with slight eversion at each bite that would be expected to favor epidermal edge apposition during healing. There is minimal puckering overall, though slight localized puckering is noted in a couple of lower segments where knot tension is modestly higher. The stitches are regularly spaced and sit at consistent depths across the closure. No evidence of deep layered closure was required on this simulator model; the focus remained on epidermal/dermal approximation using simple interrupted technique.

Summary
From start to finish the operator executes a deliberate sequence of interrupted sutures along the right‑central vertical incision column. Needle handling is controlled and consistent — mid‑shaft grips, rotational passes through the tissue, and instrument ties for knot security. The non‑needle hand alternates between toothed forceps and bare fingertip traction to evert and approximate edges, evolving toward more fingertip control as the case progresses. Spatially, instruments converge over the wound in an opposing configuration within a few centimetres, enabling precise trajectory control. Over the procedure the suturing becomes more streamlined, and the final product is a neat, evenly approximated line of interrupted skin closures with slight eversion and minimal puckering — a competent, methodical skin approximation sequence suitable for the synthetic practice model used.
