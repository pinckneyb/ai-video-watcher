COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a suture pad with three parallel vertical incisions. Work is dedicated to the far‑right vertical cut from start to finish, and the activity on other lines that occasionally appears in isolated frames is not advanced as part of this closure. The closure progresses in a deliberate, methodical sequence from the lower third of the right‑hand incision toward the mid and superior portions, adhering to the selected technique throughout.

The opening moments establish orientation and setup. The right hand comes in with tissue forceps to the lower end of the right‑side slit, lifting and everting the near wound edge just enough to expose the dermis. From the opposite side, the needle driver arrives in the left hand, the curved needle loaded at roughly the proximal third, concavity oriented for a right‑to‑left, forehand trajectory. The driver approaches perpendicular to the skin surface with a small working gap between instruments. The needle tip is placed a few millimeters from the right margin at the inferior third, and the first entry is prepared with the edges gently everted by the forceps without crushing. During the first few moments, there is purposeful organization of the strand: the long, free suture tail is drawn gently to the right to maintain a clear field, and the driver regrips the needle to refine its angle, still perpendicular to the pad. This organizing phase briefly continues with the needle holder hovering above the right slit while the forceps manage the free end; no penetration is completed yet, but the tools are aligned and coordinated across the wound axis.

With the working window set, the first pass is taken. The forceps lift the near/right edge at the inferior third, and the driver arcs the needle through the dermal layer in a controlled wrist rotation. The bite is made perpendicular to the incision line and at an appropriate depth for skin closure, with counterpressure from the opposite instrument maintaining alignment and eversion. As the needle emerges, the suture is pulled smoothly through; a long loop of material arcs across the field, kept away from the other two incisions and clear of the working tips. The needle is released and regrasped to complete its arc or to position it for exit. Throughout this sequence the hands remain opposed across the wound, the driver crossing the incision slightly above the working point, and the forceps staying just lateral to the edge to control entry and exit.

After this initial pass, the rhythm of the chosen technique takes hold. At the lower portion of the right incision, a stitch is placed, tensioned to approximate the edges, and then secured. The needle driver and forceps briefly cross above the wound during knot formation, indicating an individual stitch being completed. Scissors are introduced at this stage to cut the tails neatly, again confined to the right‑side incision. With the first secured stitch in the inferior third, the closure begins to establish its spacing and edge eversion pattern.

The next sequence returns to preparation and placement for another stitch on the same incision. The right hand, still with forceps, again lifts the right margin a few millimeters from the edge. The left hand advances the driver, needle held two‑thirds from the tip and aligned perpendicular to the skin. The entry is made on the right wound edge and the needle is driven across the slit. The opposite lip is supported but not crushed. Suture is drawn through with deliberate, even traction. In these moments, the focus is on precise tissue purchase and alignment rather than tying; the pass is made, material is managed, and the needle is reloaded for the next movement. At times, both hands momentarily leave the field to regrip or organize the strand and instrument, then return to the same incision with identical roles.

Midway through the lower to mid portion, the pattern consolidates. The driver approaches from the operator’s left; the forceps are to the right of the wound, creating a two‑instrument opposing setup that frames the incision without crowding it. The needle is consistently loaded near its proximal third, the driver face kept perpendicular to the skin, and bites are taken close to the wound margins to obtain reliable edge purchase and eversion. The suture tail often trails across the pad toward the left, but is managed so that it does not cross the line of sight. A new interrupted stitch is placed in the mid‑portion and secured: the pass completes from right to left, the edges are drawn together evenly, and knot‑tying motions follow, with scissors entering to trim tails. These tied stitches become anchor points that set spacing and apposition for subsequent passes.

As the work advances along the right‑hand slit, the consistency of technique is evident. Forceps are used only to control and evert the edge—never to crush the tissue. Bites are taken perpendicular to the wound, generally equidistant from the wound edge on entry and exit, with controlled depth through the dermis and superficial subcutis. The curved needle follows its arc naturally; when necessary, the driver releases and regrips to maintain the curvature in the tissue rather than forcing linear movement. The instruments maintain a steady working gap of roughly one to two centimeters, preventing crowding. Each pass is followed by careful suture management: the free strand is draped away from the active edge, the needle is recovered safely, and the field is cleared for the next bite. Where tying occurs, knots are squared and set with even tension; tails are cut to an appropriate length. Between stitches, the driver occasionally hovers left and superior to the wound while the forceps stabilize the near/right edge, reflecting deliberate preparation for each next pass.

The closure proceeds from the inferior third upward into the mid portion. A sequence shows the needle being presented to the right margin and driven through, with the strand drawn diagonally across to the left side of the pad. Another sequence shows a stitch completed and tied in the mid region, with the driver and forceps crossing briefly for knot formation and then separating to set the throw. Each individual stitch contributes to the overall approximation—edges are brought flush without inversion, with subtle eversion where the bites enter. The surface remains level and bloodless, as expected on a synthetic pad.

Occasionally the camera catches interludes or cutaways that do not contribute to this closure. A brief segment shows manipulation over the left incision with additional interrupted passes being added there, and another shows the central incision receiving a stitch and knots. These do not alter the ongoing right‑side closure and appear to be separate, non‑advancing activities captured within the broader session. In still other moments, the left incision is seen at rest with previously placed sutures and no hands present. The dedicated closure, however, returns consecutively to the right‑most line, which is where the technique continues and completes its progression.

Back on the right incision, attention shifts to the mid‑to‑upper half. The pattern established earlier is repeated: the right hand uses forceps to evert the near/right edge; the driver, now sometimes in the right hand depending on camera orientation, loads the needle at the proximal third and holds it perpendicular to the skin. The tip is positioned a few millimeters from the edge, and the arc is driven across the wound. The suture material trails broadly across the field and is then drawn through, with the assistant instrument helping guide the strand and avoid entanglement. In one mid‑sequence, a fresh interrupted stitch is placed and definitively tied and cut—again, reinforcing that the selected technique is built on discrete, secured passes rather than a continuous weave.

As closure approaches the superior portion of the slit, there are moments of preparation without immediate tissue penetration. The driver reorients the needle; the forceps intermittently lift and release the edge to present an ideal entry point; the free end is controlled so it does not obstruct the wound. In one brief segment, a single transcutaneous pass is visible bridging the wound without an immediately visible knot; the operator reloads and takes a moment to organize the setup before the next bite. In another, the right hand works directly over the incision without the driver, holding the needle and strand in fingertips while tensioning or repositioning the line along previously placed stitches. This fingertip handling appears to be a temporary management maneuver—tightening or preparing the strand between placements—and, although it diverges from the ideal of using a driver and forceps for every manipulation, it fits within the overall workflow of setting and managing the suture between discrete stitches. During this fingertip sequence, no new tissue penetration occurs; the operator simply repositions and tensions the strand at the superior end, likely to ready the field for the next pass.

The final preparatory sequences again show the canonical setup: needle holder approaching from above/left across the right‑side wound, the forceps hovering below/right ready to evert and control the near edge. The needle is clamped securely at its proximal third and presented nearly perpendicular to the wound margin. The instruments oppose each other across the wound with a careful, millimeters‑close working distance; the long suture loop arcs over the upper field but does not obscure the entry site. These frames capture the measured, almost repetitive cadence of the technique—present, evert, pass, pull‑through, manage the strand, and set—now occurring near the superior third where the wound is already mostly approximated by the earlier stitches.

Throughout, spatial relationships and hand positions remain consistent even as roles occasionally switch hands: one hand holds the needle driver and advances the needle in a controlled arc; the other uses forceps to evert and stabilize the edge. The driver face is kept perpendicular to the pad; the needle is grasped reliably at the proximal third to two‑thirds from the tip to maximize control of the arc; instruments are positioned so that the driver crosses the incision centrally while the forceps approach from the lateral/right side. The working planes are kept parallel to the skin surface until the moment of entry, at which the needle engages the dermis orthogonally. Suture management is careful: the free strand is consistently trailed toward the left or organized to the right, away from the bite path; loops are not allowed to ensnare instruments; and when knots are tied, throws are formed with deliberate crossing of instruments above the incision and then squared by separating the hands along the wound line. When cutting, scissors enter briefly, trim the ends, and immediately withdraw, leaving a clean field for the next pass.

Tissue handling is uniformly gentle and purposeful. The forceps grasp near the dermal edge with the tips, providing just enough traction to evert and present the target entry point. There is no crushing of the wound edges; eversion is modest but consistent, and the bites appear symmetric across the wound, aligning the epidermal borders evenly. As each stitch is placed and tightened, the edges level without gapping or ridge. The suture line lies perpendicular to the long axis of the incision, and subsequent stitches are spaced to maintain consistent approximation from the lower to upper portions of the wound.

By the end of the recorded sequence, the right‑most incision is largely approximated along its length. The inferior and mid segments bear discrete, tied stitches with trimmed tails; the superior third is in active preparation or tensioning for the next stitch, with a transcutaneous pass and strand management visible just prior to the intended bite. The overall appearance is of a well‑advanced skin closure: multiple, well‑spaced stitches hold the wound edges together with slight eversion, the suture material is managed cleanly across the field, and the remaining open segment near the top is small and ready for final closure using the same technique. Any brief views of other incisions—whether idle or briefly manipulated—do not alter this trajectory and are not integrated into the closure being completed here.

In sum, the repair proceeds in a consistent, stepwise fashion on the far‑right vertical incision. The operator establishes and maintains a reliable pattern: forceps to evert the near edge, a needle driver advancing the needle perpendicular to the skin for each pass, careful pull‑through and strand management, and intermittent tying and trimming that secure individual stitches before progressing proximally. Minor variations—brief periods of strand organization, brief fingertip tensioning, transient off‑field moments, or camera glimpses of other incisions—do not disrupt the continuity of the chosen technique on the right‑side wound. The final state is a nearly closed incision with multiple secured stitches from the inferior margin up through the mid portion and into the superior half, with instruments aligned to place the next, likely final, stitch at the top to complete the closure in the same manner as the preceding ones.
