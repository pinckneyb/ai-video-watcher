COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a deliberate, methodical closure of a single linear skin defect on a synthetic practice pad. Across the entire series the operator consistently returns to and advances closure along the same vertical linear incision located near the midline of the pad (the central vertical wound that carries a developing column of interrupted stitches). The work proceeds as a sequence of individual, simple interrupted passes placed adjacently to one another, with the operator repeatedly using a curved needle and a two‑instrument technique: a needle driver in the dominant hand and fine tissue forceps or gloved fingertips in the nondominant hand for tissue handling and suture control. Although occasional frames show activity on a neighboring short right‑side incision or preparation steps elsewhere on the pad, those moments are brief and ancillary; the dominant and sustained work throughout the recording is the progressive, interrupted closure of the midline vertical incision.

Setup and initial approach
From the outset the operator establishes a compact, bimanual working posture directly over the wound. The needle driver (long, curved‑needle holder style instrument) is wielded consistently from the dominant side, generally entering the field from above or the upper‑right quadrant of the frame. The nondominant hand alternates between an Adson‑style toothed forceps and bare gloved fingertips to lift, evert, and steady the cutaneous margins and to capture/maintain suture limbs. Hands are habitually close to the wound — typically within 1–6 cm of one another — creating a tight working envelope that supports precise needle control and swift instrument exchanges.

Needle control and bite morphology
Throughout the procedure the operator uses a curved surgical needle held in the driver at or near the mid‑shaft (commonly one‑third to one‑half from the swage/hub). This mid‑shaft grasp recurs in nearly every set of frames, providing stable rotational control of the arc for a controlled pass through the synthetic dermis. The needle is oriented either perpendicular or oblique to the wound surface, depending on the approach vector at each bite, and is passed in a gentle arc that captures full‑thickness simulated dermis near the epidermal margin. The passes are deliberate and relatively shallow—aimed to produce secure skin edge apposition with mild eversion rather than deep tissue inversion—appropriate for skin approximation on a single‑layer synthetic model.

Tissue handling technique
The left (nondominant) hand uses forceps or fingertips to present and slightly evert the near wound margin while the driver advances the needle through the opposite edge. This counter‑traction is applied intermittently: sometimes the nondominant instrument tents the tissue tip‑to‑tip to expose the dermal edge, while other times the operator uses bare fingers to compress and align the margins. The forceps also routinely receive and hold the suture tail after needle withdrawal, allowing the dominant hand to reposition the needle driver, complete knot formation, or prepare the next pass. Edge approximation is achieved manually rather than with clamps or deep tissue placement; the operator relies on precise, local control to line up the epidermal margins so that each interrupted stitch brings the edges together with slight eversion and close apposition.

Sequential placement and spatial progression
The operator advances the closure in a linear, sequential fashion. Early frames show activity at the inferior portion of the central incision and adjacent open segments. From there the line fills in progressively: bites are placed adjacent to previously secured stitches and the operator moves superiorly and laterally along the wound axis, methodically closing gaps. The spacing between stitches is consistent — the operator maintains relatively even inter‑stitch distances and places each new bite immediately lateral to the most recently completed suture, creating a neat column of interrupted knots.

Each pass follows a predictable choreography: the driver establishes a mid‑shaft grip on the curved needle and rotates it into the tissue with a controlled arc; the nondominant forceps present the opposing margin and manage the trailing suture. The needle is pulled through until a long limb is exteriorized, then instruments are withdrawn and the pair prepares the next step (either tying the current stitch or setting the needle for the next bite). In frames where knot‑tying is visible, the operator secures the simple interrupted knot in a conventional manner before trimming or arranging tails; in other frames knot formation is off‑camera or not completed within the still frames, but the suture limbs are managed and prepared for tying in every cycle.

Hand position evolution and coordination
Hand positions remain remarkably consistent in their roles but vary subtly with local demands. The dominant hand keeps the needle driver largely centralized over the incision, approaching from above or slightly lateral depending on the site being addressed. The nondominant hand alternates between forceps held lateral/inferior to the driver and direct fingertip control over the skin edge and suture tail. When placing a bite, the nondominant hand typically moves to the immediate lateral margin of the incision (≈1–4 cm from the driver) to tent and evert tissue; during knotting or tail management it may shift slightly inferior or medial to accept and manipulate the loop. When the operator works the superior or inferior ends of the wound, the pair of hands translates along the line with the same inter‑instrument spacing, maintaining the same bimanual opposition that supports precise needle passage and tension control.

Technique consistency and small adaptations
The overall technique remains consistent: simple interrupted sutures placed with a needle driver in one hand and tissue control/manipulation in the other. The many frame groups repeatedly confirm the same mid‑shaft needle grip, full‑thickness skin bites near the margins, and manual approximation for edge eversion. There are minor, context‑dependent adaptations: for example, at times the nondominant hand uses toothed Adson forceps to grasp tissue when a firmer hold is needed, while on other passes the operator uses gloved fingertips to fine‑tune edge apposition; occasionally a longer needle tail is managed manually to help seat the next throw. When working at smaller defects or triangular spots adjacent to the principal incision, the needle approach angle becomes shallower and the bite slightly smaller to avoid unnecessary puckering; for broader portions of the wound the needle arc is more perpendicular to capture adequate dermal purchase.

Instrument handling and needle transfers
Needle grasp transfer and repositioning are performed smoothly. The driver often approaches the needle tip from above and, after passing the needle through tissue, the needle is either retrieved by the nondominant forceps or withdrawn directly into the driver for repositioning. Scissors and hemostats appear at the periphery of the field but are rarely active within the still frames; instrument exchanges are predominantly between the needle driver and fine forceps. When preparing a new needle from packaging the operator briefly pauses (visible in a small subset of frames) and then resumes the same pattern of mid‑shaft grip and controlled passes.

Suture behavior and knot management
Suture material is consistently threaded and managed with care. After needle withdrawal the nondominant hand commonly holds the externalized limb to maintain tension while the dominant hand prepares the driver for a knot or readies the next pass. In several frame clusters (e.g., those showing tightening/adjustment) the operator secures a knot and organizes the suture tails; however, the exact knot‑tying strokes are often not fully captured in the still frames, so while knot formation is frequently implied (tails held, instruments withdrawn), the precise number and sequence of throws cannot be confirmed with certainty. The result, though, is a series of secured interrupted stitches with short, managed tails; at times a looped suture is left for the operator to complete a final securing step visible in subsequent frames.

Eversion and cosmetic alignment
A recurring visual outcome is slight edge eversion at the stitch line: each interrupted stitch, when tensioned, produces a modest outward turn of the margins that should favor epidermal edge apposition during healing. The operator appears attentive to producing even, eversion‑promoting bites rather than flattening or inverting edges. Spacing, bite depth, and tension are kept regular along the line to avoid focal puckering; earlier stitches are used as a visual guide to maintain consistent placement and to achieve a smooth final contour.

Management of adjacent sites and brief divergences
Occasional frames show the operator briefly working on a separate short incision situated to the right of the main midline wound. These episodes typically involve placing one or two interrupted passes on that adjacent slit. While that activity is present in the documentation, it is transient and the operator promptly returns to the principal midline closure; the long, continuous column of sutures that develops on the central incision is the dominant procedural focus. In a few sequences the operator pauses to open needle packaging or to prepare instruments on the pad’s lateral edge; those are preparatory or ancillary actions that do not interrupt the overall pattern of sequential interrupted placement on the central wound.

Progress through the middle segment and refinement
As the procedure advances, the operator occasionally pauses to adjust suture tails, tighten recently placed knots, or slightly re‑position the tissue with forceps to better align subsequent bites. These refinements become more evident in the mid‑portion of the series: hands remain close to the skin surface, the operator uses small wrist rotations to manipulate the needle arc precisely, and the nondominant hand increasingly engages in fine fingertip adjustments rather than purely forceps‑based traction. This reflects an evolving emphasis on cosmetic alignment and consistent eversion rather than a change in stitch type; the interrupted technique itself remains unchanged, but the finesse of needle placement, bite depth, and tail management subtly improves as the line fills in.

Final passes, tying, and completion
Toward the later frames the operator works at the superior and central segments of the incision, adding the final interrupted bites to complete continuous coverage of the defect. Needle passes are shorter and more deliberate in these final steps, and the operator’s hands move slightly closer together during knot tying and tail trimming to stabilize the knot while maintaining tension. In the closing moments instruments are withdrawn, suture tails are gathered and managed with forceps or fingers, and the wound demonstrates a continuous row of evenly spaced, slightly everted interrupted closures spanning the original defect. Some frames show the operator withdrawing the needle driver and holding a completed stitch tail — a final organizational gesture before the session ends.

Final appearance and state of closure
At the conclusion the incision is uniformly approximated by a neat column of simple interrupted sutures. The edges are closely apposed with mild eversion from each stitch, creating a consistent, slightly elevated ridge along the suture line that reflects appropriate skin‑edge inversion control for a superficial closure. Most stitches appear securely tightened and organized; suture tails are short and controlled. No deep layer closure is performed in this model — all manipulation is at the synthetic dermal/epidermal level. Instruments have been withdrawn from the immediate field, and the wound remains closed along its entire length without obvious gapping. Occasional residual suture loops or tails are visible in some frames prior to final trimming, but the overall impression is of a completed interrupted closure with orderly spacing and consistent tension.

Limitations and observational caveats
Because this record is composed of still frame groups, certain dynamic details—such as the exact number of throws per knot, the precise knot‑tying sequence, and small transient adjustments—are not always captured in their entirety. A few segments show activity on neighboring incisions or preparatory steps (needle packaging, instrument staging) that momentarily divert attention, but the principal and sustained work remains the linear interrupted closure described above. The needle is repeatedly grasped mid‑shaft rather than strictly at the tip, and knots are initiated/organized in most cycles even when full knot strokes are not visible in the still frames.

Summary
In summary, the recorded procedure is a disciplined, stepwise closure of a midline synthetic skin incision using repeated simple interrupted sutures. The dominant hand manages a curved needle with a mid‑shaft grasp in a needle driver; the nondominant hand manipulates tissue and suture tails with fine forceps or gloved fingertips to present, evert, and tension the epidermal margins. Bites are full‑thickness for the simulated dermis but remain superficial in intent to secure edge apposition and promote mild eversion. The operator proceeds sequentially along the incision, placing adjacent interrupted stitches with consistent spacing and tension, refining technique as the line fills, and concluding with a continuous, evenly approximated closure.
