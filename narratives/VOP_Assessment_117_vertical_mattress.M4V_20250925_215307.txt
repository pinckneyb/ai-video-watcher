COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure films a single vertical skin incision on a synthetic skin pad being closed with a sequence of interrupted skin sutures. The incision lies slightly right of the pad’s midline and measures on the order of a few centimeters in length. Throughout the recording the operator repeatedly returns to the same incision line, adding successive interrupted stitches and working from one end of the slit toward the other in a deliberate, cyclical fashion. The tissue model is silicone/foam simulant; the operator consistently takes shallow dermal-to-subdermal bites intended to approximate epidermal edges with slight eversion while minimizing trauma to the simulated dermis.

Start and initial passes (0:00–0:29)
At the outset, the wound presents as a clean vertical slit in the right-central quadrant of the pad with a single previously placed central stitch visible. The operator establishes a two-handed technique: the needle driver is held in one hand and fine toothed forceps in the other. The needle is a small curved, swaged instrument and is grasped in the needle driver near the mid- to distal shaft. Instrument tips converge over the wound with a short working distance (1–3 cm). The near wound edge is grasped and slightly everted with the forceps while the needle driver delivers a controlled arc through the opposite margin, taking a superficial-to-mid dermal bite. After the needle exits the far edge, suture material is drawn through and a loop is formed in preparation for knotting. This early portion establishes the basic pattern that repeats throughout the procedure: controlled single-pass needle placement through opposing edges, tensioning to bring dermal margins into edge-to-edge approximation, knot formation, and tail management.

Progressing sequentially along the incision (30:00–119:00)
After the initial mid-portion bite, the operator advances cranially and caudally from that starting point in a stepwise manner. Hands maintain close proximity to the incision, generally within a few centimeters of the wound margin. The needle driver most often approaches from the cephalad/medial direction while the forceps come from the lateral side to present and evert the tissue. The needle is repeatedly re-grasped mid-shaft in the driver to rotate and complete the arc; occasionally the driver repositions the needle to improve purchase as it traverses the dermal layer.

Bites are consistently taken through the superficial dermis and sometimes just into the simulated subdermal layer to create reliable apposition. The forceps apply gentle traction to evert and align edges before each pass, maintaining slight eversion in the closure to counteract expected inversion with tightening. The thread is brought through after each needle pass and, in many sequences, the operator uses the free hand to tension and control the suture tails while preparing and securing surgeon’s knots. In several short sequences the knot-tying and tail management are clearly visible—tightening, securing, and trimming are performed with coordinated instrument exchanges (needle driver, forceps, occasional small scissors). These cycles of pass, pull-through, knot, and trim repeat as the operator advances the suture line.

Mid-case adjustments and technique nuance (120:00–224:00)
As the closure progresses, instrument roles occasionally swap: sometimes the right hand holds the needle driver while other times the left takes that role; forceps interchange between thumb-and-index and Adson-style pickups. Regardless of hand dominance, the choreography remains consistent—one instrument stabilizes and everts, the other applies the needle and completes the bite. The spatial relationship is stable: instruments typically flank the incision at opposite sides or approach from above and lateral directions, with tips crossing over the line as needed to control needle trajectory.

Needle grasp is mostly mid‑shaft to body, not right at the swage, enabling smooth rotation and predictable curvature through the simulated tissue. The operator makes short, controlled arcs rather than long sweeping passes; regrasping of the needle in the driver between insertion and exit is performed when necessary to guide the tip through dense simulant material. Tissue handling is careful—forceps lifts, minimal crush of dermis, and edges approximated without excessive traction.

An isolated observation at mid-procedure suggests a continuous running pass in one short sequence, where the operator appears to advance the suture cranially in a running manner rather than placing separate interrupted knots. This observation conflicts with the prevailing interrupted pattern observed in the rest of the recording. That single sequence is brief and appears to overlap temporally with knot-pulling and suture management behaviors elsewhere, making interpretation uncertain; the dominant, repeated pattern throughout the remainder of the footage is clearly the placement of individual interrupted stitches with knot tying after each pass.

Establishing tension and tying technique (225:00–299:00)
After several interrupted bites have been placed inferiorly along the incision, the operator focuses on knot security and tail management. Hands remain close to the wound as one instrument stabilizes the knot while the other tightens throws. The operator alternates instruments when needed—one hand using the needle driver to manipulate and hold, the other using forceps or scissors to cut tails once the knot is secure. Knot-tying steps are clearly seen in multiple sequences, although in a few frames the actual tying action is not visible (positions or framing obscure the motion), creating a data gap where knot formation is inferred by subsequent tightened suture loops and trimmed tails.

Throughout these tying sequences the operator preserves the everted approximation established during the bite. Slight puckering or traction lines are occasionally visible in nearby tissue, consistent with progressive tensioning as multiple adjacent stitches are secured. Instrument tips often come within 1 cm of each other when final tightening and trimming occur, and the hands cross over the incision axis to achieve precise control.

Superior progression and finishing passes (300:00–359:00)
Work continues cranially toward the superior apex of the slit. Needle position and orientation vary depending on which side of the incision is being engaged—the driver sometimes approaches from a medial/cephalad angle and at other times from a lateral/superior direction to accommodate tissue geometry. Bites remain superficial-to-mid dermal and are aimed at producing even spacing and consistent eversion along the entire length. The operator maintains a consistent suture spacing and bite depth to produce regular intervals of approximation.

Toward the latter parts of the closure the operator routinely completes needle passes, draws the suture through the tissue, and readies the thread for knotting. In several sequences the needle is visibly being handed off between forceps and the driver or is momentarily held by the forceps near the wound edge while the driver repositions—small instrument exchanges that underline careful control of the needle tip and suture orientation.

Final tightening and inspection (360:00–404:00)
As the operator reaches the proximal end of the incision, actions transition from active needle passage to knot security, trimming, and final inspection. The superior-most bite is completed and the suture is pulled through; subsequently the driver and forceps coordinate to place and tighten the final knot. At this stage, the suture line is continuous in position and appearance, with a series of interrupted knots along the vertical slit producing apposition from inferior to superior.

The closure is not without minor imperfections: a central region shows mild puckering and, in a few frames, a small residual gap beneath the uppermost stitch is evident. These localized discrepancies are small relative to the overall alignment and appear to reflect the normal interplay of tissue tension and knot tightening as multiple adjacent stitches are secured. In some of the final frames an absence of instrumented activity is observed—the sutures remain in place and appear tied, but no active needle passage or knot manipulation is visible. This gap in observed activity likely corresponds to short intervals where framing does not capture the operator’s hands or where attention shifts to suture tail trimming outside the camera’s field.

Final manipulation and completion (405:00–end)
In the last segment, one gloved hand briefly covers the closure and manipulates a flat metallic object (packaging/foil) rather than instruments. This action stabilizes the wound and compresses the stitched line for inspection and perhaps dressing placement while no new sutures are placed. No fresh needle activity is observed in these closing frames. Existing interrupted knots remain intact and the wound margins are approximated along the length of the incision with slight eversion. The operator’s surface palpation and pressing suggest a final check for alignment and tension before concluding the repair.

Technique consistency and overall appraisal
Across the recording the operator predominantly uses an interrupted simple-suture technique: single-pass needle insertions through opposing dermal margins followed by knot formation and tail trimming. Needle handling is competent—curved needles grasped near mid-shaft for rotational control, occasional regrasping to complete the arc, and coordinated hand exchanges to preserve control as the needle exits and the suture is tensioned. Tissue handling is atraumatic with forceps used to evert and stabilize edges rather than blunt manipulation. Instrument tips work within a compact working envelope (typically 1–4 cm between tips), crossing above the incision axis when necessary to control needle trajectory.

There are minor inconsistencies and data gaps: at least one short sequence could be interpreted as a running or continuous pass, and several frames do not show the knot-tying steps even though subsequent frames reveal completed knots—these gaps likely reflect camera framing rather than substantive technique change. Additionally, in a later interval the operator’s hands are not visible for a stretch of frames, preventing direct observation of some final tying and trimming actions. Despite these isolated ambiguities, the overarching technique remains focused on interrupted dermal approximation, repeated along the same vertical slit from initial site toward the apex.

Final state of the closure
When the sequence ends the vertical incision is approximated along its length by a series of individually placed and secured interrupted sutures. Edges are slightly everted to promote epidermal apposition. The closure is generally uniform, with orderly spacing between stitches and minimal surrounding tissue distortion. A small area near the superior-most stitch shows slight puckering and a residual sub-stitch gap in one view, and the operator briefly applies a hand and flat object over the repair to inspect and stabilize the closure. No further needle passes are made after this inspection. Overall, the wound demonstrates a methodical interrupted closure with measured needle handling, consistent tissue eversion, and routine knot security and tail management concluding the repair.
