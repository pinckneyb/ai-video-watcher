COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
This narrative follows the continuous (running) suturing technique as the selected method and traces the single wound line treated from the first needle pass to the final adjustment. The wound worked throughout the recording is the long horizontal linear incision across the upper/central portion of the practice pad (the long midline transverse incision located in the upper third/center–left area). The operator proceeds along that same incision, moving the working point along its length as the suture is advanced. Observations occasionally show actions and bites resembling interrupted sutures or isolated knot-tying at nearby puncture sites; those departures are noted where they occur, but the overall intended and predominant maneuver is placement of a continuous running closure along the long horizontal incision.

Initial approach and first bites (0.0–44.0 s)
At the outset the operator sets up at the left end of the long horizontal incision. The dominant hand controls the needle driver while the other hand uses fine toothed forceps to present and evert the skin margin. The curved, swaged needle is grasped across its shaft—typically in the mid-to-proximal third—so the holder keeps control of the needle’s arc. With the forceps lightly elevating the opposite lip, small, full-thickness epidermal–dermal bites are taken close to the wound edge. The needle trajectory in these early passes is tangential to the skin surface, rotated through a controlled arc so that the needle tip enters close to the epidermal margin and exits on the opposed side, producing small, evenly spaced bites. The surgeon maintains short working distances (1–3 cm) between hands and instruments, the needle driver and forceps operating in opposition to permit precise transfer of the needle and immediate tensioning of the suture. Tissue handling is atraumatic—edges are approximated with slight eversion and minimal gapping.

Advancement and establishment of the running line (45.0–104.0 s)
As the sequence continues, the suture is drawn through and progressively advanced along the incision. The operator alternates between advancing the needle with the driver and bringing the suture tail forward to set up the next bite. Throughout these frames the pattern of successive, closely spaced bites with the suture being pulled through in a continuous fashion is evident: the thread is not being left as isolated knots at each pass but rather drawn along, indicating a running approach. The needle is consistently held near its body rather than at the swage, allowing a controlled curvature for each pass; the grasp point permits short, precise rotations of the needle to exit the tissue cleanly.

Hand positions remain compact: one instrument stabilizes and everts the near edge while the needle driver approaches from the opposite side to drive the next bite. Hands occasionally cross over the wound axis, but mostly move in parallel along the incision line. Tension on the line is moderated—sufficient to bring the dermal margins into apposition without overt blanching or puckering. The operator uses the non-dominant hand to manage the suture tail, feeding and rotating it as needed so the running line advances smoothly from left to right across the long incision.

Mid-procedure rhythm and technique refinement (105.0–194.0 s)
Midway through the session the running technique is consolidated into a steady, rhythmic pattern. Needlepresentation becomes more tangential for sequential bites: the driver rotates the needle through the near edge, then the operator pulls the thread and repositions for the next bite a short distance lateral to the previous exit. The bites remain superficial-to-mid-dermal in depth, intentionally avoiding deeper tissue capture; this keeps eversion subtle and prevents bulk beneath the epidermis. The forceps consistently evert and steady one side while the needle driver draws the needle through the opposing side, and the two hands remain within a few centimeters of each other to maintain a short working arc.

Spatial relationships are consistent: needle driver often approaches from the left/top of the incision while the forceps come from the right/bottom (or vice versa depending on frame), but these orientations are secondary to the continuing left-to-right progression of the line. The suture tail lies to the right as the line grows; the operator periodically crosses hands to pull the strand and reset the needle. At several moments the surgeon adjusts grip on the needle—grasping slightly more proximal or distal on the shaft—to change needle arc or to clear a previously placed loop. These small grip adjustments are purposeful refinements intended to maintain even bite spacing and consistent edge approximation.

Intermittent variations and adjacent site activity (135.0–179.0 s)
During the mid-procedure period, observers note occasional frames that describe short vertical or oblique defects elsewhere on the pad where the operator places isolated interrupted bites or performs hand tying. These episodes represent temporary attention to neighboring practice wounds or final securing of the running line termini. Despite these interleaved actions, the continuous line across the long horizontal incision remains the planned focus; when instrumented needle passes along that incision are resumed, they resume the same steady, sequential pattern. It is important to note these brief deviations—at times the operator stabilizes or tensions a segment by hand without a needle in the field, or ties an anchoring knot at one end of the line—then returns to advancing running bites along the horizontal incision.

Continued progression, tension control, and stitch spacing (180.0–254.0 s)
In later frames the continuous suture moves progressively from the central portion toward the lateral end of the incision. The operator preserves a consistent inter-bite distance, capturing small amounts of dermis to approximate edges without over-tightening. The needle driver maintains a mid-shaft grip in most passes, and the forceps apply light counter-traction and eversion. The suture is periodically pulled taut to approximate the wound before the next entry, and the hands maintain a compact, parallel relationship across the line. The line’s geometry—slight eversion, minimal gaping, even spacing—becomes more uniform as the operator advances.

Some evidence of finishing maneuvers appears: at several points a free tail is anchored and managed by a stabilizing clamp or by a second instrument, enabling consistent line tension as additional bites are taken. Instrument exchanges occur smoothly—forceps and needle driver approach from opposing sides and alternate roles when required—without significant reorientation of the working field. The operator’s hand dominance may appear to switch visually in some frames (needle driver in the right vs. left hand), but functionally the working arrangement maintains the required opposition of instrument to forceps to produce consistent bites along the same horizontal incision.

Finishing passes, end‑management, and local adjustments (255.0–329.0 s)
As the suturing reaches the rightward extent of the incision, the line has become an even running closure that spans a substantial portion of the long horizontal wound. The operator concentrates on completing the remaining bites with decreasing working distance between hands to improve precision at the terminal segment. The needle is often grasped nearer the curvature to permit a tighter arc for the terminal passes. The assistant hand anchors suture tails and occasionally places a small clamp to prevent retrograde loosening.

At the lateral termination of the line, completing the final bite requires attention to both tension and knot security. Frames demonstrate the operator withdrawing the needle, leaving a loop and then preparing to secure the free end. Some images show final tightening and preparation for a securing knot, and a short sequence shows knot-tying by hand (fingertip manipulation) rather than using instruments for the final throws. Where instrument-absent frames are observed, fingers bring the tail into final position, tighten the loop, and shape the knot to sit neatly on the skin surface with minimal bulk.

Final adjustments, tie-down, and trimming (330.0–369.0 s)
In the closing frames the closure is inspected and small adjustments are made: slight re-tensioning of specific segments, smoothing of mild puckers by gentle traction, and securing the terminal knot. The final knot is sometimes performed with direct manual manipulation—fingers bringing suture limbs together and advancing throws—followed by trimming of excess strand in the vicinity. Across the closure the skin edges are held in good approximation with slight eversion and no gross gapping. Some frames show completion at neighboring small defects (puncture holes) where a final interrupted knot was hand-tied; these are adjunctive activities but do not alter the continuous line’s integrity.

Technique consistency and deviations
Overall, the running technique is consistently employed: sequential bites, suture drawn continuously through the wound, tension controlled to approximate the dermis with modest eversion, and instrument coordination maintained within a short working distance. The needle is predominantly grasped at the midshaft to enable rotational control; forceps are used to evert and steady the opposite edge. Spacing and bite depth remain uniform throughout, producing a line of apposed edges with minimal tissue inversion.

Noted deviations include occasional isolated interrupted-like passes at adjacent small wounds and moments where the end of the line is secured by hand-tying without instruments. Several frames also show brief periods when the needle is not present and the operator manipulates the suture by hand—these are finishing steps and do not represent abandonment of the continuous technique. Where conflicts arise between isolated interrupted actions and the continuous pattern, those actions appear to be securing maneuvers or treatment of small adjacent defects rather than conversion of the long horizontal closure to a different technique.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Throughout the procedure the hands remain close to the incision, typically within 1–4 cm, enabling fine control. Early on, the needle driver and forceps oppose each other across the wound with the driver often approaching from the lateral/top side. As the line advances the hands follow along the incision, moving laterally in tandem: the needle-bearing hand advances the driver into the next bite while the assisting hand moves the forceps and suture tail to support the pass. When finishing the terminal bites, instrument proximity tightens and fingers may replace instruments for final knot securing. The non-dominant hand alternates between stabilizing tissue, managing suture slack, and applying slight counter-traction for consistent bite depth.

Final condition of the closure
By the conclusion the long, horizontal incision is closed with a continuous running suture that spans the treated region of the pad. Edges are approximated evenly across the length with slight eversion and minimal gaping. The line demonstrates consistent bite spacing and uniform tension; terminal knot(s) have been secured and excess suture handled (either clamped, held, or trimmed). Minor adjacent puncture sites show isolated securing maneuvers, and the operator inspects and fine-tunes the closure with fingertip adjustments. The resulting closure appears cosmetically neat and functionally sound with orderly, evenly spaced apposition along the full thickness of the simulated dermis/epidermis.

Summary remarks and deficiencies
The procedure shows steady progression of a continuous running closure along the long horizontal incision in the upper central portion of the pad. Technique is performed with standard needle grips (midshaft), predictable needle arcs, and coordinated opposing instrument motion to evert and approximate wound margins. Observed deviations—occasional interrupted-like bites at adjacent defects, moments of hand-tying without instruments, and frames without visible needle—are limited and largely reflect finishing or adjunctive actions rather than a change of the intended continuous technique. Where instruments are absent for knotting, that deficiency in visualization is noted but does not appear to compromise the continuity or security of the completed running line. Overall, the operator maintains a controlled, consistent running suture pattern from initial establishment through to final tie-down and adjustment.
