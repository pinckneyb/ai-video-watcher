COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a single, continuous closure of one horizontal skin incision on the central pink practice pad. The incision is transverse across the pad’s midline, approximately 3–4 cm in length, and it is the only wound addressed across the entire sequence. From the first frames through the end, the operator consistently returns to that same incision, placing additional interrupted stitches in sequence and finishing each bite before moving laterally along the same seam.

Initial exposure and first passes
At the outset the wound is cleanly incised and shallow; earlier, isolated short slits higher on the pad are used for practice, but the central transverse incision becomes the focus. The operator sets up with standard instruments: a curved suture needle mounted on monofilament suture (usually a purple or dark monofilament visible in the field), a needle driver, and fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson-style). Hands are gloved, and the instruments are positioned within a small working envelope—both hands generally remain within a few centimeters of one another and immediately adjacent to the wound throughout the case.

Needle grasp and orientation vary slightly between passes but remain functionally consistent. The needle is most commonly grasped in the driver either near the midpoint-to-tip region or roughly one-third to one-half of the distance from the swage toward the tip; in several frames it is noted the grasp is not at the swaged hub but farther down the shaft. The needle’s curve is used to advantage: the driver directs the needle in an arc that traverses the near wound edge and exits through the opposing edge, taking superficial-to-full-thickness dermal bites of the synthetic pad. Frequently the curve is oriented downward into the tissue as the driver approaches from above or medially, and the driver rotates to follow the natural arc of the needle for a smooth through-and-through passage.

Tissue handling and bite technique
Throughout the sequence the assistant hand (or non-dominant hand) uses Adson-style forceps to present and stabilize the opposing wound edge. The forceps provide light elevation and eversion of the dermal margin so that each bite captures an adequate amount of simulated dermis. The operator consistently aims for eversion: after the bite the edges are slightly everted rather than inverted, indicating a superficial dermal bite intended to produce an eversion-friendly approximation when the knots are tied.

The sutures are placed as individual interrupted stitches. For each stitch, the needle driver advances the curved needle through one wound edge and exits the opposite edge; the suture tail is then drawn across the defect and manipulated for knot-tying. The operator alternates between instrument-mediated and fingertip-mediated knot work: sometimes the needle remains held with the driver while the opposite forceps retrieve the needle or hold the suture tail; in other instances the needle is removed and both hands use fingertips to form and tighten throws. Where knot work is performed by hand, the operator brings fingertips close together over the wound, forming loops with one hand while pulling the tail with the other to advance throws. In several frames the operator then trims excess tails with scissors or other small cutting instruments.

Sequential progression and lateral movement
Stitches are created in a deliberate sequence that progresses along the single incision rather than creating multiple separate lines. The operator often starts at one lateral end (frequently the right-central portion) and works sequentially across toward the opposite side. Early frames document attention to the right-central area, placing a new bite there while previously placed interrupted sutures are visible along the rest of the seam. Later frames show additional bites being added medially and then more laterally, indicating a methodical right-to-left progression of individual interrupted stitches until the full length is addressed.

Between active passes, the field periodically pauses. Several frame groups show no hands or active needle manipulation: the wound appears approximated by the previously placed purple suture material and an idle curved hemostat or needle driver lies to the left of the pad. These pauses do not indicate a change in plan; rather, they reflect brief interruptions between stitch placements, instrument idle moments, or repositioning of the operator. When activity resumes, the operator returns to the same central/transverse incision and continues the interrupted pattern, placing additional bites adjacent to the previously tied stitches to maintain even spacing and consistent tissue approximation.

Needle passage details and approach vectors
Two recurrent approach vectors are used. More often, the needle driver approaches from above and medial to the incision, angling the driver shaft to bring the curve of the needle through the dermis in a smooth arc. The opposing forceps typically approach from a lateral and slightly inferior position to present the far edge and receive or stabilize the needle. At times instruments cross over the incision plane—driver and forceps tips meeting over the wound with tight coordination to control entry and exit points. In other frames the driver and forceps remain on their respective sides, working in tandem without crossing.

Grasps of the needle vary: some frames note a mid‑shaft grip that allows rotation but provides less control near the swaged end, while others show a grasp nearer the tip for precise needle-tip control. The driver orientation also varies from nearly perpendicular to oblique relative to the skin surface depending on the bite being taken—perpendicular for controlled perpendicular puncture, oblique for shallow bites when slight eversion is desired.

Knot-tying and suture management
After each passage the operator frequently retrieves the needle and pulls the suture loop through so that the two limbs span the wound. Knot formation is executed with instrument-assisted and hand-assisted techniques. In many sequences the operator uses the needle driver and forceps to create the first throw and additional throws, crossing the limbs and pulling to advance each throw snugly. In other segments, the needle is removed and the operator uses thumb and index finger grip on the suture tails to create subsequent throws manually. The hands come very close—often within 1–2 cm—while forming and advancing knots, enabling precise tensioning to approximate the edges while preserving eversion.

Occasionally the operator uses fingers directly on the skin simulator to maintain tension while tightening knots, particularly when forming the final throws of a given stitch. This fingertip work preserves control and minimizes instrument bulk under the small-field suturing. After knot formation, excess suture tails are trimmed using small scissors or cutter-like instruments; trimmed tails and loose suture ends are left short to avoid interference with adjacent bites.

Tissue response and cosmetic aims
The operator consistently aims to maintain eversion of the wound edges after each stitch. After tightening, many frames show slightly everted margins with only modest puckering or puckering limited to focal points. Small areas of mild separation—two focal points of slight gapping—are noted at times later in the sequence, but overall the stitches maintain good approximation. The synthetic dermis exhibits occasional mild blanching or puckering at tight bites, but the operator adjusts subsequent bites to distribute tension and limit tissue bunching.

Pauses, static intervals, and occasional limited visibility
There are several intervals where hands are not visible and an idle instrument rests at the left margin. During these frames the suture line is present and appears static; no new sutures are placed. These pauses do not represent an abandoned plan but rather brief breaks between bites, repositioning of instruments, or moments when the operator inspects the closure. In a few frames the needle and driver are not visible—this restricts precise observation of needle grip during those intervals, and these moments are noted as limitations in visualization. Despite intermittent obscured activity, the overall stepwise addition of interrupted stitches along the single transverse incision remains continuous across the entire recording.

Evolving hand positions and ergonomics
Hand and instrument positions evolve in response to the local stitch being placed. Early in the sequence, most needle passes are executed with the operator’s dominant hand approaching from the right-upper or medial position, while the non-dominant hand presents the opposite margin from a lateral/inferior position. As the operator moves along the wound, the relative orientation shifts: sometimes the driver approaches from above/medial, other times from above/right or right-upper, depending on which bite is being taken. When the stitch site is at the far lateral end, the operator’s hands may reposition to approach from the top of the pad, and the non-dominant hand adjusts to maintain the appropriate tension and presentation.

During knot tying, both hands frequently come over the wound and meet above it. In these moments the operator’s fingers may rest on the pad surface adjacent to the incision to stabilize the field while the other hand performs knot throws or trimming. Overall, the hands remain very close to the wound (often within 1–3 cm), facilitating precise control and minimal instrument excursion.

Technique consistency and gradual refinement
The suturing technique is consistent across the procedure: a simple interrupted pattern is repeatedly used to approximate the skin edges. Needle handling shows minor variations—occasionally the needle is grasped more proximally or more distally—but the functional intent and execution remain constant: controlled arcing passage, full‑thickness dermal bites of the synthetic material, gentle eversion of edges, knot formation and trimming. Over time the operator refines each stitch’s tension to minimize puckering; when slight gaps or focal separation are observed, subsequent stitches are placed closer to the problem area to restore apposition. The operator’s motions suggest practiced economy: short controlled needle arcs, minimal tissue trauma, and quick transitions into knot tying.

Final passes, inspection, and completion
In the final sequences the operator performs the last passes and secures the final throws, then trims remaining tails. The wound ends are approximated and the suture line spans the entire incision with a series of evenly spaced interrupted stitches. Slight residual puckering and small areas of focal gapping remain visible in a few frames, consistent with tension distribution on a synthetic pad; however, the majority of the wound exhibits good epidermal approximation and slight eversion. In the last frames the operator’s hands perform a final inspection and fingertip smoothing of the sutured line; at other times the field is static with no apparent instrument engagement, indicating the procedure is complete.

Limitations and noted deficiencies
Throughout several intervals the needle or needle driver is not visible, and in a few passes the needle is grasped mid‑shaft instead of at the hub—this reduces the degree of observed needle control and is noted as a departure from an ideal swage-near grip. Additionally, multiple frames capture moments when instruments lie idle on the pad’s lateral edge and both hands are absent from the field; these moments limit continuous observation but do not alter the overarching pattern of isolated interrupted sutures being placed sequentially along the single transverse incision.

Summary visual impression and outcome
Taken as a whole, the recorded procedure shows methodical placement of simple interrupted skin sutures along one transverse incision in the central area of the practice pad. The operator uses a curved needle and needle driver, with the non-dominant hand presenting and everting the opposite edge with fine toothed forceps. Stitches are placed sequentially from one lateral region to the other, with consistent attention to eversion and even spacing. Knot tying is executed either instrument-assisted or by direct fingertip manipulation, followed by trimming of excess tails. Pauses between stitches are present but short, and the final closure yields a continuous line of interrupted sutures approximating the wound edges with minor puckering in places but overall satisfactory apposition for this training model.
