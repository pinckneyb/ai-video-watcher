COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone training pad with three parallel vertical incisions. After a brief setup phase, all meaningful suturing activity focuses on the vertical slit at the far right, near the pad’s lateral border. The technique remains simple interrupted suturing throughout, using standard instrument ties to secure each stitch and trimming tails to finish before moving on. The surgeon advances along this same right-side wound from its mid-portion toward the superior end, building a continuous, orderly line of neatly spaced interrupted stitches while leaving the central and left incisions untouched.

The session opens with preparation. Two hands enter the field over the left-most slit, a needle driver in one hand and tissue forceps in the other. The suture packet appears, instruments are aligned, and the team appears to test positioning and readiness. Importantly, no bites are taken and nothing is placed into tissue during this early glimpse; after this preparatory moment, attention shifts decisively to the right-side incision, and all subsequent suturing occurs there.

Work on the right vertical slit begins at its midportion. The surgeon brings a needle driver in the right hand and forceps in the left to straddle the slit. The curved needle is gripped about two-thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the pad surface, and advanced across the gap with wrist rotation. The assisting forceps lift the edge to evert and stabilize the dermis, guiding the needle to emerge at a symmetric distance from the far margin. The two instruments meet over the wound, then separate to draw the suture through. The passage is controlled and orthogonal, with the bite depth and spacing consistent with good simple interrupted technique.

Immediately thereafter, the surgeon continues the stitch on the same slit, now with the needle driver in the left hand and the forceps in the right, indicating a deliberate switch in hand dominance to optimize the approach angle along the right border of the pad. The needle is again held at the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, kept perpendicular to the surface, and driven in an arc through first one lip and then the opposing lip. The forceps briefly catch the needle tip to help exit and regrasping for retrieval, then release to let the driver draw the needle through. The suture loop is cleared laterally to avoid tangling with the adjacent, unused incisions.

With the first stitch fully passed, instrument ties begin. The driver hovers over the midline while the other hand retrieves the free end and throws are formed. The knot is seated on the right side of the wound without exerting excessive tension, just enough to coapt the edges. No forceps are needed here; finger tension suffices to control the strands. The driver crosses and uncrosses the incision as loops are created, demonstrating a standard sequence of throws to secure the stitch. The result is a neat knot resting lateral to the right slit’s margin at its upper half.

The next stitch follows nearby, still on the right slit. The right hand continues with the needle holder, the left hand alternating between forceps and a second instrument to guide the needle. Bites are taken perpendicularly with controlled rotation. The left edge is lifted and everted gently; the needle passes first through the far lip, then through the near lip, keeping entry and exit points equidistant from the wound edge. The suture is drawn through smoothly and prepared for tying near the earlier knot. Knot formation again uses the instrument tie approach, and the knot is brought down to the right margin. The strand is snugged to maintain approximation and a hint of eversion, while avoiding strangulation of tissue.

At the next sequence, a single stitch in the mid-to-lower portion is tightened further. The needle remains mounted in the driver primarily as a working tool to shuttle the suture for tying; no new bites are taken in this moment. The left hand manages the free tail and the standing end to seat the knot, then scissors enter from above-right to trim the ends short. The knot lies just right of the incision line, and the tails are cut closely to tidy the field.

The surgeon then repositions for a new bite superior to the previously placed stitches, marking a gradual progression toward the top of this same right-side incision. The driver, now in the left hand, holds the needle across its proximal third to half, curve oriented toward the slit. The right hand with forceps lifts the right wound edge, imparting slight eversion and presenting the tissue accurately for entry. There is brief tension on the suture strand to keep the field clear. These frames show set-up and reorientation rather than a completed pass, but the alignment is precise and consistent with simple interrupted planning.

A new stitch is placed at the top of the rightmost incision. The forceps evert the edge and the needle is driven in an orthogonal arc across the wound, grasped near the proximal third for leverage and control. The driver regrips the tip to draw it through. The pass is clean, the suture is pulled through, and the edges are approximated evenly. Knot tying begins immediately afterward with instrument ties. The knot is seated and secured; tails remain visible but are not cut in that precise moment.

The next sequence shows knot tying only—completing throws without additional needle passes—and then trimming the tails. The right hand uses scissors to cut close to the knot while the left hand steadies the stitch. This produces a tidy knot stack adjacent to earlier stitches, with short, consistent tails. The surgeon continues up the same line, achieving a steady rhythm of pass, tie, and cut.

Progressing further superiorly, the operator trims a prior tail, reloads the needle, and takes the next bite. The driver is commonly seen grasping the needle at the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip with the needle perpendicular to the surface, the curve oriented to pass from right toward left across the slit. The left forceps guide the point and stabilize the tissue, preventing the needle from skiving and ensuring symmetric entry and exit. Edges are everted lightly; the suture is drawn to approximate the margins, followed by instrument ties on the right side. The actions remain confined to this same right slit; the other two cuts are untouched.

Another stitch is then placed and tied near the superior end. The left hand continues to manage the driver while the right hand alternates between forceps for bites and scissors for tail trimming. During tying, the driver and forceps sometimes alternate roles above the superior-most stitch site, reflecting efficient bimanual coordination. The finished knots sit consistently to the right of the wound, yielding a uniform appearance.

There is a brief interval where a new pass is prepared but not completed—regrasping the needle, probing the bite site at the top—followed by sequences that show the stitch being passed and secured. Forceps engage the right margin just adjacent to the last stitch, lifting the edge enough to guide a symmetric bite. The driver and forceps meet over the wound, the needle passes through, and then the driver parks the needle to perform the instrument tie. Multiple throws are formed, the knot is cinched down, and the tails are trimmed close. Through these cycles, the line of stitches grows neatly toward the superior end of the slit.

As the row accumulates, the surgeon periodically pauses to groom the field: tensioning and trimming tails, checking approximation, and reloading the needle to maintain the correct jaw grip at the proximal third of the needle. At times the needle is parked in the driver while tying, and the driver is used almost like a hemostat to shuttle the suture during the throws. In a few moments, the needle and driver are briefly seen hovering over the central slit, but no bites are taken there; attention promptly returns to the right wound. This brief wandering reflects instrument management rather than a change in target.

The superior progression continues. Early in one sequence, a prior tail is snipped, then the needle is repositioned for the next pass at the wound’s apex. The forceps lift the dermal edge with tip-only contact to avoid crush injury. The driver presents the needle perpendicular to the wound edge with a curve that favors a right-to-left passage. The point is set a few millimeters from the margin for the near edge entry, aligned with the pattern established in the lower stitches. While one clip shows only the initiation of this bite, the next segment demonstrates completion: the pass is made, the suture is drawn, the knot is tied with instrument throws, and the tails are trimmed. The resulting stitch integrates smoothly with the existing row, continuing the gentle eversion and consistent spacing.

Toward the end of the sequence, the field quiets. Hands hover above the upper portion of the right slit without engaging the tissue; a ring-handled instrument rests off to the side. The sutured wound shows slight puckering where prior bites were placed, with knot stacks visible laterally and tails short where already trimmed. No additional needle passes or knots are added in these final moments, confirming that the line of simple interrupted stitches along the right slit has been completed as intended within this session, with the last visible actions being tail trimming and minor adjustments.

Throughout, hand positions and instrument roles adapt to the wound’s location and the immediate task. The driver alternates between right and left hands to optimize approach angles along the right border of the pad. The assisting hand uses Adson/Brown forceps to gently grasp or press the dermal edges, consistently aiming for slight eversion and symmetric bite placement. During tying, the assisting hand switches to manage the free end, providing counter-tension while the driver executes instrument throws across the incision. Scissors are introduced intermittently, most often with the hand that is not holding the driver at that moment, to cut tails close to the knot once secure. The instruments generally straddle the slit, converging over the wound during entry and exit, then separating to pull suture through and to seat each knot. The posture of the needle remains standard—held at the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin surface, with the curved profile guiding a smooth orthogonal passage across the wound.

The technique remains consistent across all stitches. Each pass is orthogonal to the incision line, with bites taken at symmetric depths and distances from the margin. The edges are approximated without strangulation, forming a mild, desired eversion. The surgeon regularly parks the needle in the driver while tying and trims tails after securing each stitch or a small group of stitches, keeping the field orderly. While a few sequences show knot tying without active forceps on the wound edges—reflecting confidence in the prior approximation—forceps are used when needed to stabilize edges during entry and exit. The suture material is kept clear of the other incisions and managed laterally to avoid entanglement.

By the conclusion, the right-side vertical slit is spanned by a contiguous row of simple interrupted sutures that extend from the initial mid-portion upward toward the superior end. Knots are consistently seated on the right (lateral) side, tails trimmed short near the knot stacks. The wound edges lie in close apposition with slight, uniform eversion and only minimal puckering typical of evenly spaced interrupted closures. The two other vertical cuts on the pad remain untouched and unmanipulated throughout the case. The final frames show no further needle passage or tying—just hands hovering briefly above the completed row—indicating the closure on this line has been satisfactorily completed for this exercise.
