COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single, short horizontal incision across the upper portion of the training pad. From the very first frames the operator concentrates exclusively on this superior slit while a longer, parallel lower incision remains unaddressed throughout. The work proceeds in a deliberate, stepwise fashion: an initial entry on one end of the wound, anchoring of the suture, sequential tissue bites advancing along the incision, and final knotting and trimming at the terminal end. Instruments used throughout are a curved needle mounted in a needle driver and fine tissue forceps (Adson-style); at times the operator substitutes direct finger counter‑traction in lieu of forceps. Hands and instrument positions evolve predictably as the suture progresses from one end of the wound to the other.

0.0–14.0 s — Setup and approach
The sequence opens with the operator preparing to engage the superior slit. For most of these frames no hands are visible; in the final frames the right hand appears holding a needle driver poised just above the incision, tip oriented leftward and parallel to the skin surface. No forceps or left‑hand assistance are yet applied. The needle itself is not clearly visible but the driver’s position indicates preparation to introduce the curved needle into the near left end of the incision. The wound edges are gaping at this stage and not yet everted—this is the preparatory posture immediately before the first penetration.

15.0–44.0 s — Initial bite at the left apex and early control
The operator initiates the closure at the left portion of the slit. A coordinated two‑instrument technique is established: a needle driver (dominant hand) approaches from above/superior, and tissue forceps (non‑dominant hand) grasp and evert the near wound edge from below/inferior. The needle is held approximately on the proximal third to mid‑third of its body; orientation is near‑perpendicular to the skin for precise entry and is then rotated through a curved arc to exit the opposing edge. The forceps present a small, tented segment of margin, producing mild eversion so the dermal edges will approximate correctly. After passage the driver regrips the needle and pulls the suture through, leaving an adequate tail for subsequent tying. These frames show a controlled, dermal‑plane bite through the edge of the incision consistent with placing the first suture pass.

45.0–74.0 s — Securing the initial stitch with instrument ties and tensioning
Following the first pass, attention shifts to securing the initial anchor. The needle driver and a second instrument (or fingertips in some frames) form instrument ties: the driver is used to loop the standing end and pass the short tail through, with the assisting hand grasping and tensioning the tail. The left/near edge, where the initial bite was placed, is gently approximated as throws are advanced—multiple instrument‑assisted knots are formed and tightened. During this period the non‑dominant hand alternates between forceps for tissue control and fingers for tail tensioning, and the driver is used both to complete knots and to hold the needle when present. Instrument orientation remains close to the wound, with the driver just superior to the slit and the opposing hand inferior, maintaining a compact working distance.

75.0–119.0 s — Sequential bites toward the midline and transition to running progression
Once the anchor is secure, the operator begins a series of successive passes working from the initial left anchor toward the wound center. The needle is repeatedly grasped at roughly the proximal‑to‑mid third and presented perpendicular to the skin, then rotated along its curvature to take shallow dermal or intradermal bites. The non‑dominant instrument continues to evert and stabilize the lip being engaged; in some passes the assistant’s fingers substitute for forceps, providing countertraction and mild eversion. Bites are consistently placed just lateral to the epidermal margin, advancing the closure with minimal gaping. Slack is removed after each pass by pulling the strand and keeping the line of suture running along the incision axis. Early passes are occasionally interrupted for additional instrument ties to secure tension before continuing, but the overall pattern is a continuous advancement from left to right rather than placement of widely spaced interrupted stitches.

120.0–179.0 s — Consolidation at the left, new passes and resumption of advancement
Frames in this interval document further establishment of the closure and renewed passes along the same upper slit. At ~120–135 s the operator again addresses the left apex for a precise bite—forceps present the margin while the driver advances the needle across the gap. Shortly thereafter knot tying is seen to secure a previously placed stitch at the left, with the driver used to pass the short tail through loops and the forceps providing countertension. The hands remain opposed across the incision, with the driver superior and the forceps inferior, and the needle continues to be manipulated in the proximal-to-mid grasping zone. After sitting a knot down on the left end, the suture is laid across the wound axis and subsequent bites are taken moving centrally and then to the right. Throughout this stage the operator maintains tight control of tissue eversion to promote proper edge apposition.

180.0–239.0 s — Consistent dermal bites through the midline with controlled approximation
Throughout these frames the operator advances additional passes through the dermis/subdermis of the wound, focusing on symmetrical bite depth and consistent spacing. The left hand typically holds the needle driver and the right hand the forceps—however, hand laterality occasionally appears reversed in the camera perspective—but the essential choreography is preserved: the driver approaches superior/medial to the bite site, presenting the needle perpendicular to the skin; the forceps are placed at the lateral margin to lift and evert. Each needle tip follows a curved trajectory through tissue and is regrasped or handed off as necessary to pull the suture through. After each pass the strand is tensioned to remove slack and to seat the previous loop, producing progressive approximation of the incision from left toward right. Visibility is sometimes excellent, though intermittent occlusions by the operator’s arm or hair obscure completion on occasion.

240.0–299.0 s — Approaching the right end: placement of terminal bites and beginning of final anchoring
Work concentrates at the right end of the horizontal slit as the closure nears completion. The wound is now largely approximated along its midsegment, and bites at the terminal right margin are placed with increased care to avoid puckering. The needle is grasped at the proximal-to-mid section and oriented perpendicular for precise entry at the corner. Forceps gently evert the right lip to expose dermis for symmetric purchase. Some frames show the needle tip exiting near the corner and being seized with forceps so the driver can be reloaded mid‑body—this handoff technique expedites passage and reduces undue traction on the tissue. After completing the terminal bite the operator draws the suture through, aligning the strand along the incision and removing slack in preparation for knotting.

300.0–344.0 s — Final knot formation, instrument tying and tensioning at the right apex
Once the last needle pass is completed, attention turns to securing the suture line at the right endpoint. The driver is used to form instrument ties: loops are created around the jaw, the short end is grasped and passed through, and successive throws are tightened in alternating directions. The assisting hand maintains light tension on the free short tail or standing end to present the loop and to ensure the knot seats at the skin surface without gaping. The instruments operate within a few millimeters of the wound edge and act in opposition—driver above, forceps or fingers below—so that the knot is advanced directly onto the tissue. During this sequence the operator occasionally uses a second instrument from the lateral side to manipulate or trim the tails.

345.0–381.0 s — Final seating, trimming and pause
The last segment documents final extraction of the needle, snugging of the knots, and trimming of excess suture. The knot is repeatedly thrown and locked to secure the continuous line; instrument‑assisted throws are seated flush against the skin. Metzenbaum scissors or fine cutting instruments approach from above to trim the tails while the assisting hand maintains tension to present the short end safely. By the end of the sequence the running strand lies along the incision from left to right, exiting at the right margin where a short trimmed tail is visible. In the very last frames hands and instruments are absent and the operator pauses; the incision appears approximated along its entire length with slight puckering reflecting the tension of the continuous closure and multiple passes.

Technique characteristics and evolution
From start to finish the operator employs a continuous running closure technique that begins with anchoring at one end, proceeds through serial dermal/subcuticular bites, and finishes with secure instrument‑ties at the opposing end. Needle handling remains consistent: the curved needle is grasped most commonly at the proximal‑to‑mid third, oriented initially perpendicular to the skin for accurate penetration, and rotated along its curvature to exit on the opposite margin; the needle is frequently regrasped mid‑pass or handed off to forceps to facilitate extraction without undue torque on the tissue. Tissue interaction shows a steady emphasis on gentle eversion of the wound edges using fine forceps or, at times, the operator’s fingertips, reducing edge inversion and promoting precise dermal apposition. Knotting technique is instrument‑assisted throughout, with alternating throws to lock the knot securely at both the initial anchor and terminal end.

Hand position and spatial relationships
Hand positions evolve predictably as the closure progresses along the incision. Early frames show the driver above and the forceps below at the left apex; as the suture advances both hands move laterally along the wound, keeping the driver slightly superior and the assisting instrument inferior to the immediate bite site. When knotting is required, the driver forms loops superior to the incision while the assisting hand retains the tail lateral to the wound to present it for capture. Occasionally finger countertraction replaces forceps; when this occurs the driving hand remains superior and the fingers work inferiorly to tension the line. Instruments frequently work within a few millimeters of the incision, operating in opposition across the wound to control entry angle, depth, and eversion while minimizing tissue crush.

Consistency and quality of closure
Across the procedure the operator maintains a consistent approach to bite depth, needle orientation, and eversion, resulting in even approximation and minimal gapping. There is mild puckering visible at times, particularly near earlier passes, which is consistent with the tension of a continuous closure. Occlusions and brief frames without visible hands or needle occasionally prevent verification of exact needle angles or every single bite; nevertheless, the observable pattern shows disciplined, methodical advancement from the anchored left end to a secure right‑end finish with instrument‑tied knots and trimmed tails.

Final state
At the conclusion the short superior incision is closed along its full length. The skin edges are uniformly approximated with mild eversion and slight surface puckering from the tensioned running strand. The suture has been secured at the terminal right corner with multiple instrument‑thrown, locked knots; excess tails have been trimmed. No manipulation of the lower parallel slit occurred at any point. Overall the closure appears sound, with careful dermal purchase, consistent technique from entry to final tie, and careful tensioning to hold the edges in apposition for healing.

Deficiencies and observational limits
A few intervals include frames without visible hands or with the needle obscured, which prevents confirmation of every individual bite angle or regrasp during those moments. Occasional occlusion by the operator’s arm or hair also hides some intermediate steps. These gaps do not alter the clear overall pattern of a continuous, left‑to‑right dermal closure with anchored ends and instrument‑assisted knotting and trimming.
