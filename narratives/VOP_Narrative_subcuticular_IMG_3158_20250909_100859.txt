COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence documents a single, continuous closure task performed on the long vertical laceration on the right side of a synthetic skin pad. A separate incision with four pre‑existing interrupted knots remains off to the center/left and is not part of the work. Across the clip, the operator methodically builds simple interrupted sutures along the right‑sided wound, generally progressing from the inferior apex toward the superior end, with the left hand controlling the needle driver and the right hand using Adson/tissue forceps to evert and present the wound edges. The camera occasionally reframes the field, so earlier stitches sometimes drop out of view; where that happens, the narrative tracks only what is actually visible at each moment, and the final count is taken strictly from the last frames.

Opening and first stitch at the inferior apex (0–29 s)
The work begins at the lower apex of the right‑side slit with open, gaping edges and no knots present. The left hand brings in a needle driver from the left; the right hand stabilizes the right wound lip with tissue forceps, lifting the dermis to create a target. The curved needle is grasped about the proximal third of its body, kept perpendicular to the skin surface, and driven in a smooth wrist‑guided arc. The first movement is an outside‑in bite on the right (near) edge at the inferior end of the wound. Small, close bites are taken near the apex, with the forceps maintaining gentle eversion and precise control.

With the suture passed at the apex, the scene transitions to tying. The needle is held in the driver and the free strand is managed to form instrument throws. Multiple loops are created around the driver and exchanged across the incision. At this point the throws are formed but not yet fully seated down onto the surface; the knot is in progress.

First knot secured and tails cut (30–44 s)
The first stitch at the lower end is completed. The operator advances sequential throws, cinches them down to approximate the edges, and establishes a square knot. The wound edges at the apex come together with mild eversion. Scissors are then brought in to trim the tails. By the end of this sequence, exactly one simple interrupted stitch is finished and trimmed at the inferior apex of the right incision. Tally at this moment: 1 completed stitch on the right‑side wound.

Setting up the next stitch in the lower third (45–74 s)
Immediately after, attention remains in the lower third, and a new pass is initiated. The right hand now momentarily holds the needle driver near the lower‑right of the field while the left hand briefly enters with scissors then leaves; no forceps lift the edge in the earliest frames. The needle exits from the right edge, oriented perpendicular to the skin and aimed across the gap, with the suture tail trailing to the right. As the sequence continues, the left hand again takes up the needle driver from the left side while the right hand resumes forceps control. The forceps pick up and evert the right lip; the needle is positioned to take the opposite (left) bite at the lower end, keeping a 90‑degree approach and following the curvature. The thread is seen lying across the incision, marking a new stitch under construction. No tying is completed in these initial lower‑third preparations.

Inferior stitch tightened; setup for the next superior bite (75–119 s)
Work remains at the inferior end. The left hand maintains the driver just left of the slit, the right hand uses Adsons to present each margin. The tip is driven from right to left across the wound, with small, symmetric bites near the corner. The first stitch at the inferior apex is tied and seated in view, confirming the apex closure, and then the needle is reloaded for the next bite placed just superior to the apex. Over these frames, the count in view remains anchored by the single inferior stitch; the operator’s attention shifts slightly proximally to begin building the line upward.

Mid‑portion stitch placed and tied (120–134 s)
The next pass now occurs in the mid‑to‑lower third of the right‑side incision. The left hand/driver stays to the left of the slit; the right hand/forceps elevate the far edge to ensure the bite engages dermis and creates eversion. The needle, grasped near its proximal third and presented perpendicular to the skin, advances from the near (right) side across to the far (left), maintaining symmetry a few millimeters from the margin. The suture is then drawn through and tightened. A simple interrupted stitch is tied and seated at the mid‑portion of the wound. Functionally, by this point at least two stitches have been fashioned on the right cut—one at the inferior apex and one more proximally—though, depending on the camera crop, only the current knot may be visible at any given instant.

Building superiorly: initiating and completing an additional stitch (135–179 s)
The operator continues to advance proximally along the right slit. The right hand, holding Adsons, grasps and everts the right wound margin. The left hand, with the driver, approaches from the patient’s left. The needle is grasped on its proximal third to mid‑shaft and driven perpendicular to the skin to take the bite on the right edge first, exiting dermis‑to‑epidermis and then being reloaded for the opposing margin. Over the next sequence the driver regrips to complete the pass across and then releases to tie. The thread is crossed, loops formed, and a square knot is seated, establishing a new simple interrupted stitch. In these passages the operator’s mechanics are consistent: forceps present the tissue, the driver follows the needle’s arc cleanly, and knots are laid down with instrument ties. This adds another completed stitch to the series being built along the right‑side wound.

Advancing to the superior end: first bite only, then full placement and tying (180–224 s)
Now the work moves to the superior end of the right incision. The cut here is longer than the contralateral slit and shows several small dimples from prior markings or test bites, but no knots at the immediate superior margin. The right hand holds tissue forceps on the far/right edge near the top, gently pinching to evert the dermis. The left hand brings in the needle driver from the left, and the curved needle—grasped about one‑third from the swage, kept perpendicular to the skin—is driven outside‑in on the far/right wound edge at the superior end, following its curvature. Only this first bite is taken in the early part of this sequence; the needle hasn’t crossed to the near edge yet. The technique emphasizes controlled depth and tissue preservation with small bites and preserved eversion.

With the first bite set, the operator completes the passage and begins tying at the superior end. The left hand maintains the driver centered over the upper third of the right slit, while the right hand alternates between briefly using forceps to gather the free end and then managing the tail during instrument throws. Multiple loops are formed and sequentially tightened. The knot is seated slightly to the right side of the wound, cinching the superior margins into approximation. The needle rests parked just superior‑lateral to the upper edge while the throws are secured. By the end of tying at the top, a single simple interrupted stitch is clearly visible and secured at the superior end of the right‑hand wound.

Trim and confirm (225–239 s)
The immediate next view stays at this same superior site. The right hand holds the needle driver over the newly tied stitch; the left hand brings in suture scissors, crossing over the driver to cut. The synthetic skin edges at the superior end are now approximated by the stitch that has just been tied. After trimming, the instruments withdraw. In this view, that one superior stitch is clearly present; below it, two puncture marks are visible without knots, suggesting prior test bites or passes not left tied at those locations. The midline/left incision with four knots remains unmanipulated and is not part of this work.

Final pass attempt at the superior end; no knot present at end of the clip (240–254 s)
The final frames once again focus on the superior end of the same right‑side wound. The left hand holds the needle driver just medial and slightly superior to the top of the slit; the right hand steadies the lateral (right) margin with tissue forceps near the same area. The needle is grasped roughly two‑thirds from the tip, oriented to pass across the superior end. A fresh bite is made through the right wound edge and the suture is drawn through as the driver releases and the right hand pulls the free strand superiorly. The edges approximate minimally during passage, but no knot is tied in this sequence. In these last frames, no completed knots are visible anywhere on the right‑side wound; the scene shows only a newly initiated pass at the superior end with the strand being pulled through.

Technique and hand position consistency
Across all segments, the operator maintains a consistent simple interrupted technique. The needle is always presented at or near 90 degrees to the skin surface and advanced in a controlled arc, with frequent regripping on the needle body to maintain the ideal bite trajectory. The right hand’s Adson or fine tissue forceps provide delicate dermal purchase to evert each margin and expose a stable bite site. Bites are taken a few millimeters from the cut edge and are kept symmetric across the wound, avoiding undue trauma to the synthetic pad. During passage, the driver is most often in the left hand approaching from the patient’s left; when tying, instrument ties are executed with the driver guiding the free end while the opposite hand manipulates the standing end to deliver the throws squarely and seat the knot neatly just to one side of the wound line. When trimming, scissors enter from the opposite side and cross over the driver to cut tails to an appropriate length. Spatially, the two hands oppose each other across the incision throughout, converging at the wound for placement and then diverging to set tension during knot seating.

Progression pattern along the wound
The closure effort builds upward from the inferior apex toward the superior end. The first confirmed completed knot is established at the lower apex, after which the operator reloads and advances proximally, placing and tying another stitch at the mid‑portion before moving higher toward the top. In the upper third, the operator first takes a far‑side bite and then completes passage and ties, producing a visible superior stitch that is subsequently trimmed. Occasionally, the camera isolates just the working segment, so earlier knots may not be visible in a given view even though they were tied earlier in the session; likewise, isolated puncture marks below the superior knot reflect prior passes that were not left as completed stitches at those points. The final view again shows work beginning at the top, starting a new pass without tying.

Spatial relationships and evolution of hand positions
From start to finish, hands remain opposed across the wound: the left hand driving the needle from the left across the right‑side incision, the right hand everting the near or far lip depending on the pass. During knot tying, the roles shift slightly—one hand holds the instrument to throw loops while the other controls the free end and sets tension. At the superior end, hands occasionally cross as the right hand shifts superiorly to manage the free strand while the left hand stabilizes the driver over the wound edge. Throughout, the tools align parallel to the wound axis when preparing throws and perpendicular during needle passage.

Suture count progression and final verification
– Start of the procedure (0–14 s): 0 completed stitches on the right‑side wound; first bite is taken at the inferior apex.
– Tying begins (15–29 s): Still 0 completed as throws are formed.
– First completion (30–44 s): 1 completed and trimmed stitch now present at the inferior apex.
– Lower‑third preparations (45–74 s): A new stitch is set up; the previously placed apex stitch remains the reference, but tying is not completed at this new site in these moments.
– Inferior fixation reaffirmed and next setup (75–119 s): The apex stitch is shown fully tied; the needle is reloaded to continue proximally.
– Mid‑portion stitch (120–134 s): One new stitch is placed and tied at the mid‑portion, functionally bringing the running total to at least 2 completed stitches along the right wound during the session.
– Additional stitch placement and tying proximal to midline (135–179 s): Another simple interrupted stitch is fashioned and tied, raising the session total further as the line is built upward.
– Superior stitch (180–224 s): A new pass is initiated at the top and tied; a single, clearly visible superior stitch is present and then trimmed.
– Immediately before the end (225–239 s): One trimmed stitch is visible at the superior end; two lower puncture marks are evident without knots.
– Final frames (240–254 s): A fresh pass is initiated at the superior end, the suture is drawn through, but no knot is tied; no completed stitches are visible anywhere on the right‑side wound in these last frames.

Mandatory final count statement
By the final frames of the procedure (240–254 s), the right‑side wound shows 0 completed sutures visible. The sequence ends with an untied pass at the superior end and no knotted stitches in view.

In summary, the closure effort on the right‑sided incision consistently employs simple interrupted techniques with meticulous edge eversion, perpendicular needle entry, and instrument ties. The operator begins at the inferior apex, moves upward through the mid‑portion, and then focuses on the superior end, tying and trimming as they go. Although earlier portions of the session demonstrate completed knots at the lower and mid segments and then at the top, the final camera view captures a fresh, untied pass with no completed stitches visible. Therefore, the procedure, as seen in the last frames presented, results in zero completed sutures visible on the right‑side incision.
