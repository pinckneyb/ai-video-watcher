COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with multiple practice slits, but all active work consistently returns to one wound: a short, straight vertical incision in the upper-left quadrant of the pad, just medial to the left border. This line is the only site that receives needle passage, knot tying, and tail trimming throughout the recording. Other slits enter the camera’s view at times, particularly a central vertical slit, but no suturing is performed on them during the observed intervals. The operator methodically builds a short row of interrupted closures along the left-sided slit, working in small increments from its mid-portion toward the superior end, then organizing and trimming. Where the camera drifts to another part of the pad, no progress is made until it returns to this same left-sided line.

From the outset, the technique is deliberate and controlled. The opening sequence shows the first bite being taken on the far edge of the left-sided slit. The needle driver in the left hand holds the curved needle at the junction of the proximal and middle third, with a short jaw exposure for stability. The right hand, using fine tissue forceps, everts the far dermal margin to present the entry point. The driver advances the needle perpendicular to the skin surface, following the arc with a smooth wrist motion; the right hand briefly steadies the needle body as it penetrates and guides its emergence. The bite is placed a few millimeters from the wound margin at an appropriate depth, and the strand is pulled through into the wound. In this early phase the instruments straddle the incision—the driver on the far (left) side, the forceps on the near (right) side—maintaining a clear field with the suture trailing across the pad without snagging other cuts.

Immediately after this first pass, attention shifts to securing the stitch with instrument ties. The needle itself is parked safely away, and the needle holder serves as the tying instrument. The left hand positions the jaws just lateral to the slit; the right hand manipulates the free end to form loops and deliver the tail into the instrument. Throws are cinched down progressively, approximating the edges without blanching or crushing the tissue. The knot begins slightly lateral but is guided to the center of the incision as it is seated. With the stitch secure, the operator trims the tails with a fine instrument, keeping cuts close to the knot. The early tying sequences are characterized by careful, measured tension and symmetric seating of throws, with the right hand maintaining gentle counter-traction across the wound as the left hand advances each loop.

With that first stitch down, the operator immediately builds upon the closure. The next sequence returns to the same incision, now with one stitch in place and the edges already partially approximated in the mid-portion. Again, forceps in the non-dominant hand gently grasp the dermal edge to evert and expose a precise entry point. The driver, holding the needle about two-thirds from the tip and oriented perpendicular to the surface, takes a new bite at the superior portion of the slit. The pass respects the curvature of the needle, and the regripping technique is clean: once the tip has emerged on the far side, the driver adjusts its hold to pull the remainder of the needle through without torqueing the tissue. The long strand is drawn through smoothly, and the operator transitions back into instrument tying. Throughout, the suture thread is managed so that it lies superiorly across the field and does not entangle with neighboring slits; the hands move apart to snug each throw and then re-approach to set the next.

These cycles of pass, tie, and trim repeat, steadily constructing a series of closely spaced interrupted closures along the same left-sided slit. The camera captures several tying sequences without intervening needle passes—moments when the needle is parked and the needle holder is used purely as a tying tool. In these intervals, the incision edges are already coapted by the placed bite; the tying action is about seatment and stability. Knot stacks are kept tidy on the external surface, with short tails cut millimeters from the throws. As this progresses, the wound displays mild eversion along the sutured segments and little to no gaping between adjacent stitches.

By the time the superior half of the slit is occupied by a short row of closures, the operator moves to the very top of the incision, taking another bite to close the remaining small gap. This is done with the same technique: needle held at the proximal-to-middle third, perpendicular approach, and a brief regrip to deliver the needle through both edges. The right hand with forceps provides counter-traction and selective eversion at the right wound edge, ensuring symmetric entry and exit distances. After the pass, the suture is drawn through, the tail is left long enough to tie, and instrument throws are added. In these sequences, the operator alternates between controlling the free limb and using the driver as a post, taking care to maintain plane alignment so that the knot seats directly down onto the bite without tilting the wound edges.

One mid-procedure segment briefly looks like a continuous progression: the needle holder marches along the superior segment of the slit with successive bites placed in close succession, while the right hand tensions the strand to maintain apposition. Even in that brief interval, however, the handling and goal remain consistent with the selected technique for this case—individual passes intended to be tied as discrete interrupted stitches. Subsequent frames confirm this interpretation with knot laying, tail trimming, and no continuous loop of suture traversing multiple bites without intervening knots. Where there is any ambiguity in the isolated frames, it resolves once the sequence returns to clear tying and trimming of individual stitches along the same line.

As the top of the slit comes together, the operator shifts focus to refining the closure. Several frames show the right hand manipulating existing knots and organizing the tails. The left hand occasionally stabilizes the pad or provides light retraction with fingertips rather than forceps, a choice that preserves tissue while allowing quick adjustments. Fine scissors or a needle holder used as scissors trim tails in sequence along the superior segment, resulting in a neat row of short, uniform ends. During these housekeeping steps, the incision edges remain well approximated, with only the unsutured caudal portion of the slit showing minor residual gaping.

The technique remains consistent throughout: the needle is always grasped at an appropriate point on its body to maximize control, the orientation is perpendicular to the skin at entry, and the arc is respected to avoid skiving or tearing through. Forceps, when used, grasp the dermal edge lightly just enough to evert and present the bite; crushing of the edge is avoided. After each pass, the driver often regrips to deliver the needle smoothly, and the suture is drawn through without excessive drag. Instrument ties are executed with deliberate, even tension, with the right hand often serving as the working hand on the free limb and the left hand holding the driver as the knot pusher. Throws are alternated and laid flat, and in several sequences the operator confirms knot security, then trims close to the knot.

Spatially, the hands consistently straddle the incision, working tip-to-tip over the wound line. Early and mid-procedure, the left hand (driver) is positioned just superior-lateral to the slit, while the right hand (forceps or suture tail control) is on the opposing side. As the operator closes toward the superior apex, this orientation remains stable, with occasional minor adjustments in driver angle to maintain perpendicular entry and to keep the needle’s curvature aligned with the tissue. The suture is kept out of the way—laid superiorly across the pad—preventing clutter around adjacent slits that are not being used. When trimming, the instruments track down the suture line in a controlled, sequential manner, cutting tails without disturbing the approximation.

One detailed sequence at the top of the slit illustrates the operator’s finesse in finishing a newly placed stitch: the right hand stabilizes the edges by lightly pinching the dermal margins or briefly tenting them, while the left hand advances consecutive loops with the driver, grasping the free end, and seating the throws snugly. The knot is tightened with hands moving apart in the line of the suture to avoid torquing the tissue, then repositioned centrally over the bite. The final cut is made with the tips perpendicular to the wound and within a millimeter or two of the knot, leaving clean, consistent tails.

During a later phase, after several stitches have been tied and trimmed along the superior half of the wound, the operator repositions the needle in the driver, aiming to begin another pass on the same slit. In this setup, the driver hovers at the superior edge, the tip lightly tents the skin margin, and the needle is aligned perpendicular to the incision as if to start the next bite. The opposite edge is not yet engaged with forceps, and no tissue penetration is seen in those frames. It’s a poised, preparatory moment—alignment and grip are optimized, but the actual drive through the tissue is not captured before the camera view changes.

Following this preparation, there is a prolonged lull where the camera centers on a different slit—the central vertical incision—and then shows mostly idle frames or non-field areas. Importantly, during all such intervals, no needle, suture, or instrument interacts with the central wound; its edges remain un-approximated and unchanged. When the camera later drifts still further off the operative field, revealing a gray background and a white drape edge, no suturing occurs. These segments represent pauses or repositioning rather than any change in the site of operative work. The only wound that ever receives suturing activity is the left-sided slit described above.

Across the entire sequence, the closure on the left-sided slit evolves logically and consistently. It begins with precise, perpendicular needle placement on the far edge, proceeds through a series of individual passes with instrument ties that progressively approximate the wound from the mid-portion toward the superior end, and then transitions into a refinement phase where knots are seated and tails are trimmed in order. Hand positions evolve only as needed: early on, the right hand employs tissue forceps to evert and control the opposite edge; later, the right hand largely handles the suture strand during tying and acts as an assistant during trimming. The left hand remains the driving hand with the needle holder, regripping and adjusting the needle as required, then converting the instrument to a knot pusher during ties. Throughout, the operator respects the curve of the needle and the plane of the skin, takes symmetric bites a few millimeters from the edge, and avoids excessive tension that would blanch the synthetic tissue.

The final state at the last clear view of the wound shows the superior half of this left-sided slit closed with a tidy row of interrupted sutures. Edges are apposed with mild eversion and slight, expected puckering near the knots; the tails are trimmed short and consistently. The inferior portion of the slit remains slightly open at that point, suggesting that additional stitches were planned next—the operator is seen reloading and positioning for another bite—but those subsequent passes are not captured before the camera moves away from the field for an extended interval. No additional wound is sutured at any time, and the central slit that appears in later frames undergoes no manipulation. Taken together, the footage documents a careful, stepwise closure of the left-sided vertical incision using the selected technique, with clear evidence of proper needle handling, meticulous instrument ties, effective management of suture strands, and attention to edge eversion and symmetry. Where the camera temporarily obscures the field or shows another incision, there is no change in operative focus and no deviation from the established approach.
