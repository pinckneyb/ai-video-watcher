Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion is calm, deliberate, and repeatable. The working triangle stays intact, needle driving is consistently perpendicular with a true arc, and the right hand alternates seamlessly between edge control, needle delivery, and suture management. The flow cycles predictably—evert, drive, deliver, tension, tie, trim—producing a clean, even closure without visible trauma or tension errors.
