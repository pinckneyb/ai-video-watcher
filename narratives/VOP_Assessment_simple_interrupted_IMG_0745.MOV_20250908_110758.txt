Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
The motion economy and flow were disciplined: consistent needle loading, perpendicular entries, and smooth wrist-driven arcs produced clean, symmetric bites. Knot tying choreography was repeatable and efficientâ€”loops formed and advanced cleanly with alternating throws, knots centered and flattened with balanced bimanual tension, and scissors consistently presented parallel to the skin for tidy tails. The operator kept instruments close to the work, rarely crossed hands, and avoided entanglement by parking the needle before tying.
