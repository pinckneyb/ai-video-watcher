============================================================
The procedure opens with identification of a single superficial incision in the silicone practice pad located slightly left of the midline. At the earliest frames the incision is already being engaged: a short single-layer curved-to-vertical skin defect in the lower half of the pad shows an initial suture strand in place and the operator preparing to place or secure the next interrupted stitch. The working field is compact; instruments and gloved fingers remain within a few centimeters of the defect throughout. The approach is methodical and consistent: a curved surgical needle mounted on suture is controlled with a needle driver while fine tissue forceps are used to elevate, evert, and steady wound edges and to retrieve suture tails. The simulator material is only superficial dermis analogue, so all handling is confined to epidermal/dermal layers with no deep layer work.

From the outset the operator uses a conventional needle grip on a curved needle — typically mid‑shaft to distal‑third — orienting the needle tip down toward the skin edge and advancing it in a controlled arc. The near edge is frequently tented and approximated with Adson‑style forceps while the needle driver enters from the opposite side and carries the curved needle through the far dermal edge. Bites are small and precise, taken a few millimeters from the wound margin, and aimed to bring the epidermal edges into close apposition with modest eversion. The needle is rotated with short, controlled wrist motions; the driver often acts as a fulcrum against the superior wound margin to control depth and trajectory. The operator repeatedly repositions the driver along the needle shaft as needed to maintain control of the arc and tip during passage.

Early sequences show the first complete interrupted stitch being established. The needle is passed from lateral to medial (or from the near to far edge depending on orientation), the suture pulled through with the fingers or forceps, and then the loop is tightened. Throughout these initial maneuvers the hands are tightly coordinated: one hand (most often the left) holds the needle driver over the wound, while the other hand mans the fine pickup to manipulate tissue and manage the suture tail. Instruments typically remain within 1–3 cm of the incision, approaching from slightly superior/medial and lateral/inferior vectors so the jaws converge over the wound to control needle entry and suture retrieval. Occasionally the roles alternate briefly, but the choreography remains constant — one instrument driving the needle, the other opposing and stabilizing tissue, then switching to suture handling and knot formation.

As the operation proceeds the operator establishes a sequential series of simple interrupted sutures along the same vertical/curved incision. The sequence progresses cranially along the wound: after completing and securing the initial stitch, the surgeon moves slightly superior to place the next bite adjacent to the prior knot. Each new pass is handled in the same disciplined way — small, superficial dermal bites, mid‑shaft needle grip, forceps tenting the near edge, and controlled rotation through the tissue. Needle passes are commonly near‑perpendicular to the skin surface or at a shallow angle, depending on whether the aim is to capture slightly more dermis for eversion or to stay strictly epidermal for a low-profile closure. Across frames the needle is sometimes held a bit nearer the hub or slightly toward the tip when finer control is required for shallow bites near the epidermis.

Tensioning and knot security are recurrent focal points. After each pass the suture tail is drawn through and the loop is tightened to bring edges into apposition. The operator uses fingertip control or forceps to tension the free strand while the needle driver assists in forming the throws. Knot‑tying motions are deliberate: the driver and forceps manipulate the suture limbs to fashion square, secure throws, and the tails are then organized for trimming. During many sequences the operator adjusts previously placed sutures — retightening, reposing tails, and trimming excess — before moving on. This iterative tightening and trimming helps maintain uniform edge approximation along the entire repair.

Throughout the repair there is consistent emphasis on epidermal apposition with slight eversion of edges. The synthetic pad’s limited pliability means the surgeon must be precise with bite depth and spacing to prevent puckering. Indeed, several frames document minor puckering and small inter‑knot gaps that are corrected as the repair advances — the operator repositions forceps or re‑tensions knots to even out the closure. At times a previously placed loop is held while the operator prepares a subsequent throw, or the needle driver serves temporarily as a stabilizing instrument against the wound margin to act as a fulcrum for knot formation. The workflow alternates between needle passes, suture capture and pull‑through, knot formation, suture tail trimming or dressing, and preparation for the next adjacent bite.

Hand positions evolve only subtly over the course of the case but remain consistently adjacent to the incision. In early frames the needle driver tends to approach from superior/medial vectors while the fine pickup approaches from lateral/inferior; in later frames the surgeon occasionally reverses orientation depending on access to the cranial-most portion of the incision. Hands remain within a narrow workspace: typically 1–6 cm from each other across the wound with tips converging over the incision. At times the instruments cross briefly over the wound plane during needle retrieval, but the operator maintains a compact, efficient posture to keep control of the needle arc and suture tension. When cutting or trimming suture tails the operator introduces a small scissors or suture snip instrument in the lateral hand, again keeping movements close to the wound to avoid losing suture ends.

Needle handling shows a steady refinement as the repair progresses. The driver grip is consistent — jaws on the shaft, typically in the distal-third — but the angle of approach is varied to suit bite orientation; sometimes a perpendicular bite is favored to take a small cross‑section of dermis, while at other times the needle is angled to capture slightly more tissue for secure eversion. Re‑grasping of the needle is observed when the operator needs to adjust arc or exit point, and the assistant forceps often change from a pure tissue pickup to a suture‑manipulating role as the stitch is completed. When the needle has been fully withdrawn the driver releases and the second hand snatches the suture tail to begin tying; when the needle remains attached the operator uses the free limb to tension the loop while the driver completes the pass.

No deep tissue or subcutaneous layers are entered; all bites are confined to the superficial dermal analog. The technique is a classic simple interrupted skin closure throughout: pass the curved needle through one side, then the other; draw the suture; tie square knots; trim tails; and move to the next location. This straightforward method is repeated in series to recreate a uniform line of interrupted stitches from one end of the incision to the other. On several occasions the operator pauses to manipulate and re‑position an earlier knot in order to improve edge approximation, demonstrating an iterative quality control emphasis rather than a single linear pass without adjustment.

As the repair advances toward the superior end of the incision, the operator works increasingly cranially, placing additional interrupted stitches adjacent to the previously tied ones. Each new stitch mirrors the previous ones: small superficial bites, modest eversion, consistent spacing and orientation. The surgeon anticipates the next pass by holding the suture tails out of the field, aligning the driver so the needle arc will enter at the desired point, and using the forceps to tent the near edge to avoid catching excessive epidermis. Occasionally, when access is constrained near the end of the repair, the operator alters hand positioning slightly — rotating the instrument approach or swapping which hand holds the needle driver for comfort and visibility — but the essential technique remains unchanged.

Throughout the process there are periods devoted to finishing work on already placed sutures: tightening throws, trimming tails, and ensuring knots sit neatly adjacent to the skin. When the majority of stitches are in place the operator spends time arranging tails to minimize interferences and to reduce tissue puckering. Small residual gaps between a few knots are observed at times, and the surgeon corrects these by retightening specific stitches or placing an additional throw if necessary. These corrective maneuvers are conservative, aimed at achieving smooth epidermal alignment while avoiding excessive tension.

The physical relationship of hands and instruments to the wound remains intimate from beginning to end. The needle driver often occupies the superior or cephalad orientation relative to a given bite, with the opposing forceps approaching from the lateral or inferior side to receive the needle and to evert tissue. Hands typically operate within 2–4 cm of each other with tip‑to‑tip cooperation; in some frames the gap widens to 5–6 cm when the driver is positioned to pull across a broader arc, but the working space remains compact. Instruments may briefly cross over the wound during exchanges or needle retrievals, but the operator maintains controlled, predictable passages and avoids excessive hand retractions between steps.

By the final sequences the incision is spanned by a row of closely spaced simple interrupted sutures. Most knots are secured and trimmed; the wound edges are approximated with modest eversion and only minimal puckering at a few sites. The operator performs last adjustments — smoothing tails, re‑tensioning a throw, and trimming final suture remnants — to produce an even, apposed line. The closure shows the expected small superficial bite footprints in the synthetic dermis; underlying tissue planes were not explored given the model’s limitations and the chosen technique. The simulation’s material occasionally limits the tactile nuance and the visual appraisal of needle tip depth, so the operator relies on consistent spacing and bite depth to achieve uniformity.

In summary, the case demonstrates a textbook, methodical placement of sequential simple interrupted skin sutures along a single short vertical/curved incision left of midline on a synthetic pad. The operator employs conventional needle‑driver and fine forceps technique throughout: mid‑shaft needle grips on a curved needle, forceps tenting and everting the wound edge, small superficial dermal bites close to the epidermal margin, careful suture tensioning and square knot formation, and final trimming and dressing of suture tails. Hand positions remain tightly coordinated and close over the wound, with slight variations as the repair progresses cranially and as finishing work is performed. The end result is a continuously approximated linear closure, with multiple interrupted stitches evenly spaced and secured, minor residual puckering corrected as needed, and the wound surface neatly coapted along its full length.
