COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator set to close a single, short vertical skin defect on the left side of the practice pad. At the opening frames the wound sits in the left‑central/upper‑left quadrant of the pad: a straight 1.5–3.5 cm linear incision through the synthetic epidermis and dermis, pliable and without active bleeding. The surrounding pad bears multiple previously completed sutures along adjacent lines, and the team’s objective is to place a series of individual interrupted skin stitches to restore edge apposition along this solitary line.

From the outset the operator uses a two‑instrument technique: a needle driver in the dominant hand and fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style) in the other. The instruments remain in tight coordinate proximity throughout—tips often within 1–3 cm of each other and of the wound margins—so that the forceps can present, lift, and evert the edge while the driver advances the curved needle in a controlled arc. The needle is consistently a small curved surgical needle mounted on monofilament suture; the operator grips it around the mid‑shaft to distal third depending on the particular bite, repositioning the grasp between passes as needed to control arc and depth.

Initial passes are deliberate and controlled. The near edge is lifted with the forceps and held slightly everted so the epidermal lip will approximate well when the stitch is tied. The needle driver holds the needle relatively close to the body of the needle and brings the tip down into the near edge on a shallow oblique to perpendicular trajectory; the needle traverses superficial dermis through to the far margin in a near‑to‑far then far‑to‑near pattern, producing short dermal bites about 2–5 mm from the wound edge. Each pass is performed with small, efficient arcs: the driver is rotated through the curvature of the needle to pass it through the tissue rather than forcing a straight push. The forceps hand immediately steadies the opposing margin at the point of exit to ensure that the bite mirrors the opposite side and that the skin edges evert slightly rather than invert.

Early sequences show the operator taking single passes and pulling suture material through, then preparing for knot formation. The pattern is consistently individual interrupted stitches: needle passed across the wound, suture drawn through until tails are available, and then tightened and prepared for tying. Throughout, the bites are superficial to the dermis/subcutis simulated layer rather than deep full‑thickness passes: the goal is epidermal approximation with slight eversion and minimal tension on the underlying tissue. Spacing between stitches is kept regular and uniform; as closure progresses toward one end of the incision the operator slightly reduces the gap between newly placed sutures to ensure even distribution and secure closure at the terminal segments.

As the procedure continues, subtle refinements in technique become apparent. The operator repositions the grip on the needle to optimize trajectory: at times the grasp is mid‑shaft to facilitate a perpendicular bite; at other times it moves closer to the swage for finer control of a shallow dermal pass. The driver’s orientation shifts dynamically—initially more perpendicular to the skin to obtain secure purchase, then rotated to a more parallel orientation as the tip engages the dermal plane and exits the opposite edge. These adjustments reflect attention to bite depth and the need to prevent undue puckering. Between passes the left hand often momentarily applies fingertip pressure or uses the forceps to lift and fine‑tune edge alignment, ensuring a consistent eversion profile across each stitch.

Hand positions evolve in a predictable, efficient pattern. Early in the video the operator’s hands approach the wound from slightly different quadrants—one instrument often coming from a superior/cephalad vector while the other approaches laterally—but as the sequence progresses the hands settle into a stable interplay: the needle driver frequently occupies a position just medial and slightly above the wound while the forceps remain lateral and slightly below or at the wound margin to present tissue. When working at the superior-most and inferior-most ends, the driver may approach from a more cephalad angle and the forceps adjust to provide countertraction. Throughout, the hands remain close together, allowing rapid needle transfer, quick regrips, and immediate suture tensioning. There are frequent small crossings of instruments over the incision axis when the driver and forceps converge on the bite site, but these movements are economical and maintain good ergonomic spacing for precise needle control.

Technique consistency remains high: the operator uses simple interrupted stitches throughout rather than switching to running or mattress patterns. Needle passes are short, controlled arcs through dermal tissue with a focus on epidermal alignment. After each pass the suture is pulled through carefully, tails managed to permit secure knot formation. In many frames knot‑tying occurs immediately after suture passage with instrument‑based tying technique—driver and forceps forming throws and cinching them down—followed by trimming or managing the tails to keep them clear of adjacent bites. In some sequences new sutures are placed between existing ones, indicating attention to even distribution and avoidance of excessive tension at any single point.

Spatial relationships between hands and the wound are consistent and deliberate. The needle driver usually works from the operator’s dominant side, approaching the incision either straight on or obliquely; the forceps approach from the opposite side to present tissue. The two instruments often bracket the incision: one medial, one lateral; one cephalad, one caudal; but always adjacent to the wound to minimize lever arm and maximize control. Where the wound narrows near its superior tip the instruments converge closer—often less than 1 cm between tips—to allow precise final bites without overlying tissue bunching. When the operator moves up or down the incision to place the next stitch, both hands translate together across the pad so the same two‑instrument relationship is maintained.

A few frames intermittently describe activity on a different, more central or right‑side incision. Those brief descriptions appear inconsistent with the overall sequence and likely represent momentary camera focus shifts or notes from other practice pad areas; however, throughout the vast majority of the series the left‑side vertical line receives continuous attention and sequential stitch placement. Any brief indications of work on the right or center do not reflect a sustained change in plan: the operator returns to the left line and continues adding stitches in a sequential, methodical fashion.

Mid‑procedure, efficiency increases. The operator’s grip and wrist motion become more economical: the driver is regripped fewer times per pass, and the needle is presented with consistent arc and entry point. The forceps hand anticipates the exit point and is already positioned to receive the needle or to stabilize the tissue, reducing wasted motion. Bites are kept uniform in distance from the edge and in depth, producing a line of slightly everted closure with minimal puckering. When placing stitches near the already‑stitched portions, the operator narrows spacing to ensure there are no remaining gaping segments; when working near the apex, smaller bites secure the terminal tissue without tearing the thin pad material.

The operator also demonstrates controlled suture management. After each knot the tails are kept to manageable length and moved laterally out of the way of the next pass; sometimes a left hand holds suture tails with forceps while the right repositions the needle, reflecting coordinated two‑handed choreography. At a few points the needle is regrasped closer to the tip to finish an exit or to pass a particularly short arc where the tissue is tighter; elsewhere the grip is more central to use the full curvature for a broader bite.

As the line nears completion, stitch placement becomes slightly denser toward the distal or superior margins to respect the geometric taper of the wound and to prevent dog‑ears. The operator continues to maintain slight eversion of each approximated edge so that when the sutures are tied and trimmed, the epidermal edges sit in apposition without inversion—this technique reduces the risk of edge necrosis in real tissue and here provides an even cosmetic profile in the simulation.

Final sequences show the operator completing the last few interrupted stitches at the superior portion of the incision, tying down and trimming tails where appropriate, and smoothing the line. The final appearance is an evenly spaced row of interrupted sutures running the length of the original defect, each producing gentle eversion and close epidermal approximation. No deep tissue sutures were introduced; the closure is focused on dermal/epidermal alignment. Instrument positions at the end show the needle driver stowed and the forceps returning to a neutral position as the operator inspects the repair and tidies suture tails.

Throughout the entire case the technique remains disciplined and consistent: a simple interrupted pattern, controlled mid‑shaft needle grips with occasional adjustments for bite geometry, forceps‑assisted edge presentation, and coordinated one‑or two‑handed knot tying. The hands move in compact, paired motions along the incision, maintaining the same two‑instrument choreography from the first bite to the last. Where frame descriptions briefly imply activity on other regions of the pad, those instances are isolated and transient; the procedural focus clearly remains on the single left‑side vertical incision, which is closed sequentially and methodically into a neat, slightly everted line suitable for further postoperative care.
