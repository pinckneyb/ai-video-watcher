Pattern: Simple Interrupted

1. Perpendicular needle passes: The needle is repeatedly reloaded to a true 90-degree approach and driven in a smooth arc with minimal shear, producing deliberate perpendicular entries. Minor reorientation steps suggest attention to angle but also small inefficiencies; overall, passes are appropriately perpendicular and controlled. 4/5 proficient

2. Gentle tissue handling: Forceps use is minimal and precise, with pencil-grip presentation and light traction to evert a corner without crushing, and the needle is consistently parked safely. Tissue is stabilized with minimal lift and no visible pinching or torsion, reflecting careful handling. 4/5 proficient

3. Square, secure knots: Instrument ties are alternated with opposing vectors and seated flat on the epidermis, producing true square throws that stay low-profile. Occasional slight off-center settling of the knot is noted but does not compromise security. 4/5 proficient

4. Appropriate approximation/tension: The operator consistently draws throws horizontally to avoid gapping, and edges meet cleanly without puckering. Knots are snugged just enough to approximate without crushing, maintaining even apposition. 4/5 proficient

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm): The resulting line shows well-spaced interrupted sutures with uniform intervals along the left laceration. Placement is consistent and orderly, supporting even tension distribution. 4/5 proficient

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable): A corner bite is intentionally everted with forceps, while most other bites rely on suture tension to approximate, yielding predominantly flat edges. Eversion is adequate but not consistently emphasized across all stitches. 3/5 competent

7. Economy of time and motion: The workflow is calm with a consistent pass–tie rhythm and instruments mostly remain in the field, but frequent regrasping, angle refinement, and “tidying” pauses before the next bite add extra steps. Parking and repositioning the driver as a post is safe yet slightly dilutes efficiency. 3/5 competent

Summative assessment:
This is a controlled, methodical sequence with a steady pass–tie cadence, consistent perpendicular entries, and disciplined knot construction. Hand roles are clear, the left-hand driver reliably serves as a post, and the needle is parked safely during ties, reflecting mature situational awareness and field control.

Efficiency can improve by reducing regrasping and pre-bite “tidying,” planning the next bite during knot seating, and minimizing instrument parking on the field. Emphasize routine, active edge eversion on every bite and keep knots centered over the wound axis to standardize cosmesis. Overall, this demonstrates competent, safe interrupted suturing with good control and knot security; tightening up economy and consistently executing eversion will elevate the work from solid to exemplary.
