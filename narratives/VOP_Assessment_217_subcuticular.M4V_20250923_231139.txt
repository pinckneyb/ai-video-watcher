COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure is a methodical closure of the right lateral skin incision on the practice pad: a single vertical slit located along the pad’s right margin. The work is concentrated along that one wound, beginning at the inferior tip and progressing cephalad toward the superior end. Instruments and hands remain clustered over that right‑edge incision throughout, and the surgeon consistently uses a curved cutting needle and standard microsurgical instrument technique—opposed needle driver and tissue forceps—while performing sequential simple interrupted passes with instrument‑tied knots. Although a few brief frames show what appears to be a smaller oblique defect at the extreme lower corner or transient repositioning of the drivers, the dominant, continuous task in every sequence is placement, tightening and securing of individual stitches along the single right‑margin wound.

0:00–0:14 — Initial approach and first bite
The case opens with the left hand holding a needle driver and the right hand using tissue forceps. Both hands move down to the inferior end of the right‑most vertical slit, near the pad’s rounded corner. The curved needle is mounted in the needle driver, grasped around the proximal to mid third of its arc, and oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin edge. With the forceps lifting and slightly everting the far (right) wound lip, the driver advances the needle tip into the epidermis/dermis of that right margin and arcs it through toward the opposing (left) edge. The entry is done as a shallow, controlled skin bite appropriate for epidermal/dermal approximation; the opposing edge is not yet grasped. The strand is pulled through and laid across the field, setting up the first simple interrupted stitch at the inferior extremity.

0:15–0:29 — Tensioning and initial knot formation
Following the initial pass, the needle driver is repurposed to begin instrument ties. The driver parks near the wound and alternately grasps the long strand and releases to form loops while the assistant hand (or the contralateral instrument) controls the short tail with pickups. The right‑hand forceps stabilize the wound edge while the left driver executes sequential throws. Edges are approximated as loops are cinched; no new bites are taken. The pattern of instrument‑ties—wrapping the long strand around the driver, transferring the tail, and cinching down—is established here and will repeat for every stitch.

0:30–0:44 — Locking throws and stabilization
The knotting sequence continues at the lower end of the slit. The needle is parked in the driver while the operators form additional throws with alternating instrument grips. The right‑hand forceps hold the short tail near the wound margin while the driver cinches each loop down until the stitch holds the epidermal edges in apposition. The needle remains attached to the long strand and is kept outside the immediate knotting zone to avoid tangling.

0:45–0:59 — Completing the first knot, preparing the next stitch
With the stitch tied down and tissue edges closely approximated, instrument throws are finalized. The driver and pickups work in a compact triangle around the incision so that the knot seats on the skin surface. The long strand is tensioned and the knot tightened fully; the operator keeps the tail outside the wound to maintain control as the knot is secured.

1:00–1:14 — Repositioning for the next bite at a neighboring slit (brief ambiguity)
A series of frames at this interval focuses on a short vertical incision slightly more inferior/lateral on the pad, where the needle driver sits obliquely and the right hand uses forceps to manipulate the suture and wound edge. This appears as a short shift in visual attention to a nearby patch of skin and may reflect tailoring of instrument position or momentary attention to a closely adjacent defect. There is no substantive new pass noted here; rather, the needle is repositioned and prepared for the next bite along the main right‑edge slit. This is one of the few moments where the recorded view momentarily suggests work on a smaller oblique slit, but the dominant continuous activity returns to the principal right‑margin incision immediately thereafter.

1:15–1:29 — Needle reloading and tail control
The operator regrips the curved needle about two‑thirds from the tip and holds it ready to take the next pass. The right hand alternates between Adson forceps to evert the edge and the driver to perform instrument throws when needed. Throughout these exchanges the left driver maintains control of the needle’s orientation. The wound edge is gently stabilized with the forceps, and the needle is positioned to enter the skin at an appropriate distance from the margin for a good epidermal bite.

1:30–1:44 — Advancing a second bite through the dermis
The driver advances the needle through the inferior‑mid portion of the right lateral slit. The forceps lift the lateral edge to present the dermis and epidermis to the needle tip; penetration is superficial and consistent with skin closure technique. The suture is then drawn through, leaving a free strand crossing the field. Fingers and instruments remain opposed across the wound with the driver on the patient’s left and the forceps on the patient’s right, maintaining a controlled working corridor.

1:45–1:59 — Knotting and seat‑down of the second stitch
After passage, instrument ties commence. The long strand is wrapped around the parked driver and the free tail is grasped by the opposing instrument to complete the throws. Sequential cinching reduces the gap and seats the knot lateral to the wound. The operator uses alternate grips to create secure instrument‑towered knots; the right forceps serve both to hold the tail and to provide counter‑traction on the skin edge while ties are advanced.

2:00–2:14 — Completion and brief reassessment
The newly formed knot is tightened and the tissue edges are seen approximated without gaping. The needle is reloaded for the next pass and the suture strand is managed to keep slack away from the working field. Hands remain close to the upper portion of the same right‑edge slit, and other incisions on the pad remain untouched.

2:15–2:29 — Moving cephalad to the mid‑height of the slit
Attention shifts up the same vertical slit to the mid‑height. The curved needle is again held by the driver on the proximal third, arc oriented to travel from the right margin toward the left. The right forceps approach the right wound edge to evert and stabilize it as the needle is brought to the entry point. At this stage the operator is repeating the established pattern—enter, pass, draw the strand, and prepare to tie—now working progressively higher on the same line.

2:30–2:44 — Needle traversal and delivery of the thread
The driver advances the needle through the near/right wound edge and arcs it across to the contralateral margin. The forceps provide counter‑traction and expose dermal tissue for a consistent bite depth. The suture emerges on the left side, and the operator pulls a smooth length of thread through, keeping the strand under light tension across the pad.

2:45–2:59 — Knot formation and tightening at mid‑slit
With the pass completed, instrument ties are executed. The needle driver wraps the long limb to form a loop and the forceps control the short tail as the loops are transferred and cinched. The knot is carefully drawn down until the skin edges sit in close apposition; the right edge remains slightly everted as needed to ensure edge-to-edge contact of dermis.

3:00–3:14 — Tail trimming and tidying
Following secure knot formation at the mid level, scissors appear to clip the suture tail close to the knot. The cutting hand approaches from the superolateral direction and trims the tail while the assistant maintains slight tension on the opposing limb to avoid loosening the knot. This tidies the repair and leaves a short tail. The needle is parked or reloaded in preparation for the next superior pass.

3:15–3:29 — Progressing to the superior third of the slit
The team advances to the upper portion of the same right‑edge incision. The needle holder and forceps assume the familiar opposed positions: the driver crossing from the left, the forceps anchored on the right margin. The needle is grasped about the mid‑to‑distal third and aligned perpendicular to the skin. With a controlled wrist rotation, the needle is entered at the right edge and delivered through the dermis toward the left edge; the passage is smooth and superficial.

3:30–3:44 — Suture drawn and knotting begins near the top
The suture is drawn through and the long limb managed to form instrument ties. Forceps continue to evert the right wound lip while the driver performs sequential wraps; the free end is transferred and cinched down, locking the stitch at the superior site.

3:45–3:59 — Completion of knot throws and final cinching
Multiple throws are made to secure the stitch, following the same instrument‑tie pattern used throughout: the long strand is wrapped around the parked driver, the tail is grasped with the opposing instrument, and loops are alternately tightened until the knot is fully seated. Operators remain cautious to keep the knot slightly lateral of the wound line so the final loop compresses the dermal edges without inverting or everting them excessively.

4:00–4:14 — Rechecking approximation and suture trimming
After the final throw, the knot is tightened and the tension is checked by both hands. The forceps hold the tail, the driver places the finishing throws and then releases. Scissors are brought in once more to cut the residual tail adjacent to the knot, leaving a short stump. The wound along the entire right margin now displays a series of well‑approximated skin edges with evenly spaced, instrument‑tied simple interrupted sutures.

4:15–4:29 — Intermittent handling and knot‑security maneuvers
During the remaining seconds of recorded activity, the operator revisits earlier knots briefly to double‑check security: several frames show the driver re‑grasping the knot or the adjacent strand to make final, minor adjustments and to ensure that each throw is snug. The right hand sometimes swaps between forceps and a second driver for improved tail control during instrument ties; the left hand consistently controls the needle driver when new bites are needed and later is used to form the loops for tying.

4:30–4:44 — Final instrument passes and cleanup
In the closing frames the driver parks a curved needle away from the knotting zone, and both hands withdraw slightly as they perform final instrument‑tie passes. The suture tails are cut close to the surface and the operator ensures there is no residual slack across the pad. Instruments remain parallel to the wound axis as they are removed from the field to avoid disturbing the freshly seated knots.

Overall technique and evolution
Throughout the entire case the team uses a consistent, reproducible approach: sequential simple interrupted epidermal/dermal bites placed from the inferior end of the right lateral incision and progressing cephalad toward the superior pole. The needle is repeatedly grasped on the proximal or mid third to allow a controlled arc across the cut, and it is oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface at entry to create symmetric epidermal eversion and dermal apposition. Tissue forceps are used primarily to evert and stabilize the right wound margin at each entry point while the driver advances the needle; occasionally the driver itself functions to provide gentle edge control during passage.

Knotting is performed with instrument ties throughout. The operators rely on a systematic sequence of wrapping the long limb about the parked driver, transferring the tail with the opposing instrument, and cinching each throw down—producing secure, flat knots that seat lateral to the wound edge. The right and left hands alternate roles as needed: the left hand most often controls the needle driver executing passes and forming loops; the right hand typically handles Adson forceps to evert tissue, hold tails, or perform tying with a second driver. Scissors are introduced sparingly and predictably to trim short tails after the knot is secured.

Spatial dynamics and hand evolution
Hands and instruments remain clustered over the same incision throughout. The left‑hand driver generally approaches from the patient’s left side and crosses toward the wound to drive the needle from right to left; the right hand anchors on the lateral edge of the slit and provides the everting counter‑traction. As the procedure progresses upward along the slit, the driver and forceps maintain this opposed relationship, moving cephalad in small increments. During tying sequences the instruments form a compact triangle with the incision at its center: the driver often sits medially/superior to the wound while the forceps rest laterally/inferiorly to control tails. When scissoring is required, scissors are introduced from the superolateral aspect and cut close to the knot while the opposing instrument protects knot security.

Consistency and quality
The suturing technique is consistent from the first pass to the last: shallow, dermally‑based bites that bring epidermal edges into direct contact, controlled needle arcs with the driver grasped at a reproducible position on the needle shaft, gentle eversion of the lateral edge with Adson forceps, and instrument‑tied knots seated flush to the skin. There is no evidence of deep tissue bites, crushing of tissue, or wide spacing between stitches; each pass is deliberate and oriented to produce a cosmetically acceptable closure.

Final state
By the completion of the recorded sequence, the entire length of the right lateral incision is closed with sequential, well‑apposed simple interrupted sutures. Knots are neatly seated lateral to the wound line and compressed sufficiently to approximate the edges without causing inversion. Suture tails are trimmed short and excess thread removed from the field. The skin edges along the pad’s right margin lie in close, evenly spaced apposition from inferior to superior with no residual gaping. Instruments withdraw from the region with the wound secure and tidy, leaving a clean series of interrupted sutures along the right‑edge incision.
