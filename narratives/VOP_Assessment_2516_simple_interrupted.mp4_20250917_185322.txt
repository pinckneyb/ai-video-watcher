COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel, vertical slits. Lighting and camera position frame the field so that the pad’s right margin is clearly visible, and each incision is distinct and unambiguous. The operator is already set with a curved needle mounted in a needle driver and a pair of tissue forceps within reach. Throughout the sequence, the work is meticulous and methodical, with careful attention to needle angle, wound edge eversion, and suture management, using standard instrument ties to secure each interrupted stitch.

The very first moments show a brief, isolated maneuver on the leftmost slit. The right hand holds a needle driver, the left hand alternates between forceps and fingers to manage the strand, and the needle is loaded at approximately the proximal third of the curve, perpendicular to the pad. The left wound edge of that leftmost slit is gently lifted and everted with the forceps while the needle driver presents the tip to the near side, engages, and follows its curvature across the gap to the far side. The suture is drawn through, and the needle is reloaded for a second pass just superior along the same line. No knot is tied in these introductory frames, and this left slit is not revisited. After this brief, non‑continuing demonstration of basic bite placement, all subsequent work shifts to the vertical incision at the pad’s far right edge and remains there for the remainder of the procedure.

The main closure begins at the rightmost incision, a short linear cut near the pad’s right margin. Initial activity concentrates at its lower third. The left hand assumes control of the needle driver with the jaws vertical over the wound, while the right hand works with tissue forceps for precise edge control. The needle is clamped at the junction of the proximal and middle third of its body, oriented perpendicular to the skin substitute. With the right wound edge stabilized and gently everted by the forceps, the left hand advances a controlled forehand arc, capturing the near margin and traversing the gap to take a symmetric bite on the far margin. The suture is drawn through, and the short end is retrieved to set up an instrument tie. Throws are placed deliberately, alternating direction to lock the knot without undue torsion. The knot is seated directly over the wound line, bringing the edges into apposition with slight eversion. The right hand transitions to scissors and trims the tails to tidy the field.

Working just superior to that first stitch, the next series of frames shows a similar rhythm: the driver now in the right hand and forceps in the left, still poised over the rightmost incision. The needle is again grasped at the proximal third, held perpendicular to the synthetic skin, and driven in a smooth arc through one edge and then the other, with the assisting hand everting and presenting each margin in turn. The pass is completed, the suture pulled through under controlled tension, and multiple instrument throws secure the knot. The knot sits consistently to the right side of the wound, and the hands cross and separate as needed during the tie to keep the loops orderly and the tension well balanced. Throughout, the unused incisions remain untouched and free of instruments.

The closure proceeds systematically along this same right‑edge slit, building a small row of evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches. With each new pass, the operator positions the needle holder directly over the wound line, ensures that the jaws grip the needle at a point that maximizes control (commonly two‑thirds from the tip or at the proximal‑to‑middle third), and keeps the needle’s curvature perpendicular to the skin for an orthogonal, atraumatic trajectory. The forceps—mostly in the right hand during these mid‑sequence placements—pick up the near wound edge to achieve reliable eversion. Equal depth and width are taken from each side of the incision, maintaining symmetry and avoiding dog‑ears. After passage, the forceps often let go of the tissue and, instead, control the suture end to help maintain consistent tension and prevent tangles while the driver regrips the needle or sets up for tying.

At intervals, as the row of stitches grows, the operator pauses to attend to knot security and cleanup. One sequence shows the left hand holding the needle driver superior to the wound, grasping the suture rather than the needle while the right hand switches to forceps and then scissors to help translate and dress the knot, and finally to trim the tails. In these tying moments, the needle remains parked in the driver while throws are cast. The driver often crosses over the incision transiently, with the opposite hand maintaining a steady hold on the short end. Each knot is cinched with a small, deliberate motion that seats it firmly at the edge without crushing the wound margins or inverting them. The short limb is consistently managed on the right side; the standing limb arcs diagonally across the pad when necessary to maintain a clear corridor above the incision.

As the line extends, hand dominance alternates seamlessly to maintain ergonomic, forehand passes and consistent needle handling. Sometimes the left hand carries the driver and lays down the stitch while the right hand’s forceps stabilize the right wound edge. Other times, the right hand moves into the driver role, particularly when the next bite benefits from an approach vector that keeps the needle perpendicular and the pass forehand. In each instance, the assisting hand is positioned opposite the driver across the incision, holding the target edge 2–4 mm from the margin to avoid crushing the very edge while still providing excellent exposure and eversion.

Several sequences illustrate careful pre‑positioning and reloading prior to the next pass. The needle is regripped on its body to restore a perpendicular presentation, with the curve oriented to follow a natural wrist arc. The driver advances across the gap; the forceps sometimes transfer the needle tip as it exits, preventing sudden jerk forces on the tissue and keeping the needle point controlled at all times. The suture strand is kept out of the needle’s bite path—often trailing superior‑left across the field—so that it does not snag or create unintended loops.

The stitch line climbs superiorly along the right slit, and the edges of the wound are consistently approximated after each knot. In a few moments, the operator returns to a segment just inferior to an existing knot to place an additional stitch. The movements are unchanged: the needle engages the near side with a forehand entry perpendicular to the skin, passes through with a uniform bite, exits on the far side, and the suture is drawn through. Gentle traction on both strands approximates the edges before tying, avoiding over‑tightening that could blanch or invert the margins. Instrument ties follow—multiple throws, alternating direction—seating the knot and leaving short, neat tails.

As the superior end of the right‑edge incision is approached, the technique remains consistent. A prior pair of stitches sits in the mid‑to‑lower portion, and the next passes are laid just above them, moving toward the top. The right hand, now with forceps, tents the right wound edge adjacent to earlier knots to present the dermis. The left hand holds the driver, the needle clamped two‑thirds from the tip, and the tip is poised at a constant margin matching the spacing of prior stitches. With a smooth wrist rotation, the needle arcs through the right dermal layer and continues across to exit the left side at a symmetric depth. The assistant hand briefly shifts from tissue to suture control, gripping the short end to modulate tension as the strand is pulled through.

When tying these upper stitches, the driver and forceps alternate crossing paths above the incision. The long and short ends are kept on opposite sides to preserve clarity. The loops lie flat, the friction between strands is used to lock each throw without cranking down excessively, and the final seat of the knot occurs with a short, precise motion that brings the edges together with subtle eversion. In one sequence, the right hand moves to scissors and trims the newly secured tails; in others, the tails are left intact to the right side, aligned and out of the way while more stitches are placed.

Occasionally, a previously placed stitch is tightened a touch more before the next pass is begun. This is done by drawing on the standing limb while the opposite hand stabilizes the knot and monitors the wound edge response. After this brief adjustment, the needle is reloaded and oriented for the next bite. The operator is careful to maintain a consistent bite width relative to the incision, mirroring earlier stitches so that the row looks even and the tension distribution remains uniform. The spacing and geometry are deliberate, aiming for a balanced closure that neither gaps nor puckers.

Near the top of the right slit, multiple sequences capture the initiation and completion of new stitches, followed by tying with instrument throws. The knot ends tend to lie on the right side of the incision, reflecting the side on which the short limb is controlled. Throughout, the working corridor stays narrow and disciplined: the needle driver works vertically just over or slightly medial to the wound; the forceps are lateral, close to the right edge for fine exposure; and during ties, the driver sometimes crosses the line while the other hand holds the short end steady on the near side. The suture loops arc over the incision but never entangle the neighboring slits, which remain untouched after the opening moments of the video.

In several mid‑late sequences, the instruments briefly withdraw from the field after tightening a stitch, then return to the same incision to either place the next bite or secure the most recent one. When reappearing, the left hand often approaches from the upper left with the needle driver, reestablishes control of the needle at the proximal third, and assumes a perpendicular presentation for the next pass. The right hand, lateral to the incision, uses forceps to tent the right skin margin, demonstrating consistent control and atraumatic handling of the synthetic tissue.

Tying sequences at the superior end of the line are particularly clear: the driver holds the needle and strand superior to the wound while the opposite hand—first with forceps to manipulate the short suture end and later with scissors—completes the tie and trims the tails. No new tissue bites are taken during these specific stretches; they are devoted to securing previously placed stitches and ensuring that each knot lies flat, is well seated, and contributes to uniform approximation.

By the end of the run, the right‑edge incision is spanned by a neat row of simple interrupted sutures. The superior and mid portions of the wound show well‑opposed edges with slight, intentional eversion created by thoughtful forceps handling and controlled knot seating. The knots are small, snug, and oriented consistently to the right, with short tails that do not crowd the line. The operator’s needle handling has remained disciplined throughout: the driver grips the needle at the proximal‑to‑middle third, the needle enters the skin perpendicularly, and the arc is followed smoothly to avoid lateral tearing or imprecise exit points. The assisting hand alternates between stable edge eversion with Adsons and precise management of the short suture limb during ties, helping keep each knot low‑profile yet secure.

In the final static view, there are no hands in the field. The right‑edge incision is partially but effectively closed by the series of interrupted stitches, which approximate the edges nicely along the superior through mid‑inferior segments. A small residual gap remains at the most inferior end where another stitch could be added; otherwise, the edges are well aligned with gentle eversion and no inversion or strangulation. Free suture ends extend laterally to the right and lie flat without tangles. The two central incisions—untouched during the main closure—remain distant and free of suture material.

Across the entire procedure, the method is consistent with a simple interrupted skin closure performed with instrument ties. The operator keeps the needle oriented perpendicular to the skin, uses measured, symmetric bites with reliable edge eversion, and secures each stitch with multiple alternating throws. Suture management is orderly: the standing limb is kept out of the bite path, the short limb is controlled during tying, and tails are trimmed as appropriate. Hand roles are flexible and responsive to the needs of each pass; the driver alternates between left and right hands to maintain forehand arcs and perpendicular entry, while the assisting hand provides steady countertraction and exposure from the opposite side of the incision.

Although the very first frames show a brief, isolated placement across the leftmost slit without knotting—an action not resumed later—the procedure proper is carried out entirely on the rightmost incision. From the early stitches at the lower third, through midline bites and up to the superior end, each step builds a coherent closure that prioritizes uniform spacing, consistent depth, and gentle eversion. The final appearance is that of a carefully constructed interrupted suture line, with well‑seated knots to the right and a largely approximated wound, needing only a final inferior stitch to complete the closure fully.
