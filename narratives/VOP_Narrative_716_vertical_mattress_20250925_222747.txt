COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator settling over the left-most vertical laceration on the silicone practice pad and proceeds as a focused, sequential placement of multiple simple interrupted sutures along that same line. From the opening frames the surgical plan is evident: the operator stabilizes the wound margin with fine tissue forceps while the dominant hand controls a curved needle in a needle driver, taking small, controlled full‑thickness bites through the synthetic dermis and advancing stepwise along the length of the defect. Instruments and technique remain consistent throughout—curved cutting needles held mid‑shaft in a driver, opposing toothed Adson‑style pickups to evert and steady skin edges, and repeated, deliberate passes followed by knot/throw sequences and suture tail management—resulting in a series of closely spaced interrupted stitches approximating the wound edges with slight eversion.

Initial passes (0–44 s)
At the outset the right hand predominantly wields the needle driver (an instrument consistently identified by a red tag/ring in several frames), while the left hand holds tissue forceps. The needle is grasped about mid‑body or proximal on the curve, enabling the operator to rotate it through a short, nearly perpendicular arc relative to the wound edge. The forceps tent and evert the near edge, presenting a stable target; the driver approaches from above or from the operator’s right and pierces full‑thickness through the synthetic dermis to the opposite margin. Bites are deliberately small—taken close to the wound edge—so that when tensioned they invert only minimally and produce the desired slight outward eversion for optimal epidermal apposition. After each pass the suture is drawn through so that a loop is available for knotting.

Early in the sequence both hands are typically 1–3 cm from the working point and form a compact triangle with the needle tip to preserve precision. The operator uses a pencil/three‑finger style grip on the driver in some frames and a tripod orientation in others, with the grasp point adjusted to control needle rotation through tissue. The forceps grip is similarly precise—Adson‑type toothed pickups are used to stabilize and evert without crushing the synthetic tissue.

Progressing along the wound (45–149 s)
As the procedure continues, the operator advances along the same vertical line, placing additional interrupted stitches in sequence. The progression is methodical: needle passes, retrieval and/or positioning of the suture tail, followed in subsequent frames by knot tying and tail trimming. In many frames the operator’s motions shift from needle driving to knot management—tightening throws, tensioning the loop to evert the edges slightly, and trimming the tails with suture scissors. The needle driver remains the primary tool for needle control; the non‑dominant instrument provides consistent tissue stabilization and suture handling.

Throughout this interval the characteristic features of the technique are maintained. Each bite traverses the dermal depth of the pad, approximating the epidermal margins directly without engaging deeper subcutaneous layers or performing separate deep dermal sutures. The operator occasionally pauses to inspect tension and edge apposition—sometimes pointing with an index finger or withdrawing instruments momentarily to reassess alignment—then resumes with the next bite. Instrument positions shift subtly as the operator moves from superior to inferior (or vice versa along the short vertical defect), but the relative spatial relationship remains: the driver approaches from one side while the forceps oppose from the other, hands staying close and coordinated.

Reinforcing technique and managing knots (150–239 s)
Midway through the procedure more frames emphasize the knot‑tying and suture tail management aspects. The needle may be withdrawn or repositioned between throws; the driver secures the needle near the swage for controlled rotation, and the forceps assist with suture capture and tensioning. At times the operator switches briefly between instruments—introducing scissors or a clamp to cut tails or temporarily dock a suture—but the working pattern returns repeatedly to the core sequence of bite, retrieve, tie.

During these sections attention to detail is notable: edges are everted slightly during knot tightening, and tension is adjusted to avoid puckering while still achieving precise apposition. Hands continue to operate within a compact workspace—typically 1–4 cm apart—so that needle transfer and suture management can be performed without awkward extension. Occasionally the operator’s forearm or gown marginally occludes the field during repositioning, but these brief interpositions do not alter the underlying repetitive workflow.

Focused passes and minor variations (240–314 s)
The operator maintains the same closure pattern as the line advances toward its superior or inferior terminus. Needle handling remains conventional: the curved needle is gripped near mid‑shaft to maximize control of the arc, and short, perpendicular-to-slightly oblique bites are taken so that the needle traverses full thickness of the simulated dermis. Forceps continue to lift and evert the near edge just before passage. In several frames the driver and forceps are seen to cross directly over the wound as instrument tips converge to exchange the needle or to snug a loop, demonstrating close bimanual coordination.

While the dominant pattern is a right‑handed driver and left forceps, there are intermittent frames showing the needle driver in the left hand or the forceps in the operator’s dominant hand—indicative of brief instrument exchanges or ambidextrous adjustments. These occurrences are infrequent and do not alter the continuity of the closure technique: interrupted bites are still taken sequentially along the same line, and tensioning/tying steps follow each pass.

Completion of stitches and final adjustments (315–359 s)
As the row of interrupted sutures approaches completion, the operator spends more time on knot security and trimming. The needle is sometimes held in the driver near the hub to withdraw or dock it for safety after the last pass. Forceps and hemostats are used to maintain loops while throws are secured. Instances show active tightening and cutting of suture tails, with one hand stabilizing the knot while the other manages scissors or a cutter. The wounds are inspected visually—hands withdraw briefly to assess edge approximation and detect any small gapping that requires an additional intervening bite.

Throughout these frames the wound edges remain well approximated with minimal gapping; suture placement is closely spaced to ensure even tension across the incision. The synthetic dermis demonstrates slight everted margins after knot tensioning, which is consistent with the operator’s goal of epidermal edge alignment for optimal healing approximation.

Final inspection and closure state (360–366 s)
In the closing frames the operator performs a final assessment of the sutured line. Instruments are repositioned and small adjustments are made—some knots are retensioned and a few tails are trimmed to finish the cosmetic line. The operator’s finger is occasionally used to palpate or point to the incision while the instruments are withdrawn. The final appearance is a continuous row of closely spaced, evenly tensioned interrupted sutures bringing the epidermal edges into direct apposition with slight eversion, and no deep tissue layers or undermining have been performed on the model.

Technique evolution and consistency
Across the entire procedure the suturing technique is remarkably consistent: repeated placement of simple interrupted sutures with small, perpendicular-to-oblique bites through the simulated dermis, deliberate tightening to achieve slight eversion, and meticulous knot‑tying and suture tail management. The operator maintains a controlled grasp on the curved needle—typically at the mid‑shaft—to facilitate rotation through tissue and predictable needle trajectory. Tissue handling is atraumatic in the context of the model: toothed forceps are used to evert and steady without obvious crushing, and tension is applied judiciously to avoid puckering.

Subtle evolution in technique is evident as the operator completes the row: early frames prioritize establishing accurate bite placement and suture spacing; mid‑procedure there is a balance between passage and knot management; later frames emphasize knot security and trimming. Instrument exchanges and occasional handedness changes occur but are brief and appear to be tactical adjustments rather than fundamental shifts in method. Occasionally, frames describe activity on adjacent incision lines or show the operator momentarily inspecting other areas; these are transient and the entire suturing session remains targeted toward completing the same single vertical line.

Hand positions and spatial dynamics
From start to finish the hands remain centralized over the working line, rarely straying more than a few centimeters from the wound. The dominant hand typically controls the needle driver while the non‑dominant stabilizes with forceps; both hands form a compact, stable working triangle with the wound. Instruments sometimes cross directly over the incision for needle transfer or knot management, reflecting close bimanual coordination. When attention shifts to knot tying and tail trimming the driver may be used in concert with scissors or hemostats; when inspecting, the operator occasionally points with a gloved index finger before resuming instrument work.

Final state of closure
At the conclusion of the procedure the left‑most vertical incision is closed along its length with a continuous sequence of simple interrupted sutures that are closely spaced and evenly tensioned. The edges are approximated with slight eversion, preventing inversion of the epidermal margin, and there is no evidence of excessive tension or tissue strangulation on the synthetic model. Knot throws have been completed and tails trimmed, and the line is visually inspected for uniform apposition. The workflow demonstrates a controlled, methodical approach to interrupted skin closure: reliable needle control, consistent small bites, precise tissue handling, and attentive knot security produce a cosmetically favorable closure on the practice pad.

Note on observational inconsistencies
A minority of frames document activity at other incision sites or show brief attention to adjacent wounds; these occasional deviations do not change the overall continuity of the primary closure described above. The dominant, repeating pattern across the video is the systematic placement of interrupted sutures along the same left‑most vertical line, executed with consistent bimanual technique, deliberate needle handling, and stepwise knot management culminating in a well‑approximated wound closure.
