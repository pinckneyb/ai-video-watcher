COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents stepwise placement of a row of simple interrupted skin sutures to close a single vertical laceration on a synthetic practice pad — the same linear incision located slightly to the right of midline in the upper third of the pad (the second vertical slit from the right). From the start to the finish of the video the operators work exclusively on that one wound, adding sequential interrupted bites and completing each knot before moving to the next adjacent point along the same line. Throughout the case the surgical team uses a consistent instrument set and a coordinated two‑handed technique: a needle driver in the dominant hand to control the curved needle and suture, and fine toothed tissue forceps in the nondominant hand to stabilize and evert tissue, retrieve the needle, manage suture tails and facilitate knot‑tying. Occasional scissors or a small cutter are introduced when tails are trimmed.

Initial passes and early technique
At the outset the wound is a full‑thickness synthetic incision with exposed substrate and one or two early stitches already present near the inferior aspect. The operator approaches the wound from a roughly superior/right vector while the assistant or second hand approaches from below/left. The curved needle is consistently grasped in the driver at a mid‑shaft to distal third purchase (occasionally closer to the swage in some frames), and the driver is oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface for controlled, short arc passes. The nondominant forceps lifts the near edge, creating a small eversion as the needle traverses the opposing edge. Bites are taken shallowly through the dermis of the pad, with an aim at superficial‑to‑mid‑dermal depth rather than deep or layered closure.

Early sequence frames show the surgeon making a single controlled needle throw through the near edge, the driver rotating to complete the curve and withdraw the tip through the far edge while the forceps present and grasp the tissue. As the needle emerges the forceps retrieve the tip and the suture is pulled through; this same movement repeats to establish the loop required for the interrupted stitch. The pair of hands operates in a tight working zone (typically 1–3 cm between instruments), crossing lightly over the wound axis as the driver and forceps form a pincer‑type coordination. The suture is then tensioned, and knot throws are performed with the driver and forceps controlling the limbs to seat the knot down snugly without over‑tightening. Slight edge eversion is achieved on most bites.

Progression up the wound and repetition of the stitch pattern
After completing the initial bites and securing the early knots, the team progresses incrementally along the vertical incision, placing subsequent interrupted sutures adjacent and superior to the previous ones. Needle grips vary slightly between passes — sometimes the grasp is nearer the swage for stronger control, other times mid‑body grips are used — but the motion remains a controlled rotation through a short arc using the curve of the needle to traverse the tissue. The nondominant hand repeatedly manipulates the tissue edge, everting or approximating it while the driver pierces and draws the suture through. In several frames the assistant uses the forceps not only to present tissue but to manage and tension suture tails as knots are formed; a small scissors or cutting instrument is introduced intermittently to trim tails after knot completion.

Technique nuances and handling variations
Throughout the series the technique remains that of sequential simple interrupted sutures, but with some variability in bite depth and spacing. On multiple occasions bites are described as slightly asymmetric, with one side taken a bit deeper or closer to the wound edge than the other, producing uneven suture tails or a minor inverted‑V appearance at one anchor. Generally, however, the operator aims for superficial‑to‑mid‑dermal purchase and light eversion of edges to promote edge apposition. The needle trajectory is consistently shallow and controlled; the driver is repositioned or regrasped when necessary to guide the tip through the opposing margin, and the forceps are frequently repositioned to retrieve the needle or to steady tissue.

The hands maintain a predictable choreography: the dominant hand drives and manipulates the needle while the nondominant hand presents tissue and receives the needle. When knotting, the two instruments converge over the wound with the driver applying downward/medial tension and the forceps stabilizing and orienting the tail to permit secure throws. At times the left and right hands switch roles slightly (e.g., using the left driver and right forceps) depending on small changes in approach angle or the location of the bite along the incision, but the overall coordination remains consistent: one instrument controls the needle and suture, the other controls tissue and tails.

Mid‑procedure adjustments and suture management
As the row extends, the operator occasionally pauses to reposition or trim tails, and to ensure previously placed knots remain snug. Several frames depict the needle being grasped near the hub to guide an exiting tip or to reorient the arc for the next bite. Forceps occasionally grasp the suture loop to prevent entanglement while the driver reorients. The instruments often cross directly above the incision during needle passage; this close proximity enables precise transfer of the needle and careful control of bite depth. Throughout, the pad’s synthetic dermis limits tissue stretch, and no undermining or deep layer approximation is performed — all action is confined to epidermal/dermal simulation.

Advancing toward the superior aspect
Work advances toward the superior end of the incision. Frames centered near the mid and upper‑mid segments show the same pattern: needle passes through near and far edges, retrieval with fine tissue forceps, suture pull‑through, knot throws and tail trimming. Small differences appear in some bites where spacing or depth varies slightly from the earlier, more symmetrical stitches; occasional mild gapping is visible between adjacent bites, and some stitches exhibit short tails projecting laterally rather than lying flush. The operator continues to use light traction on suture limbs to seat knots and achieve modest eversion, avoiding tissue strangulation.

Final passes, knotting and tail management
In the final working frames the operator completes stitches at the superior-most portion of the incision. The needle is placed, retrieved, and knotted in the same controlled fashion; multiple previously formed knots remain along the vertical line and help hold apposition as the last throws are seated. Scissors are used intermittently to trim tails close to knots. By the late frames the wound is closed across most of its length by sequentially placed interrupted sutures; a vertical column of knots and tails runs along the incision. The hands remain close to the wound until each knot is secured and tails are managed.

Ending observations and final wound status
In the closing frames no instruments or hands are visible, and the wound is seen with multiple tied knots and loose tails projecting laterally. The absence of hands and needle in these final stills prevents assessment of the very last manipulations, but the completed row is apparent. The final closure approximates the skin edges along a roughly 3–4 cm length with a series of simple interrupted sutures that generally achieve edge-to-edge apposition with slight eversion — the intended goal for epidermal approximation. Some small gaps are present between bites in places, and bite depth and spacing are not perfectly uniform: a few sutures are slightly asymmetric in depth or spacing, and there is minor eversion or puckering at some knots. No deep layer or subcutaneous closure was performed; the technique remained focused on superficial dermal approximation throughout.

Instrument and hand dynamics over time
Across the entire case the dominant pattern of hand positioning and motion is consistent: a needle driver controls the curved needle and performs the needle‑throw and rotating motions, while fine toothed forceps present and stabilize the tissue, retrieve the needle, manage the suture loop and tailor the tails during knot‑tying. Instruments repeatedly cross above the wound in a tight working zone (commonly within ~1–3 cm), forming a coordinated pincer approach that facilitates precise needle transfer and consistent tensioning of sutures. Occasionally the operator repositions the grip point on the needle, and the nondominant hand is used to steady or to trim tails, but the underlying two‑handed choreography remains the same from the first pass to the last.

Overall assessment of technique development
The suturing technique remained directed and methodical: interrupted stitches were placed sequentially from an initial inferior/mid location, moving superiorly along the same vertical incision. The operator consistently used the curved needle’s arc, controlled mid‑shaft grasps, perpendicular-to‑oblique needle trajectories and coordinated forceps support to take superficial‑to‑mid‑dermal bites and secure knots. Minor inconsistencies in bite depth and spacing appeared as the row progressed, and a few small gaps and uneven eversion remained in the final closure — likely reflections of technique variability in a tight workspace and the synthetic nature of the pad. There was no attempt at layered closure or undermining, and tissue approximation depended entirely on the superficial interrupted stitches.

In sum, the entire video documents a continuous, orderly placement of simple interrupted sutures along a single vertical incision (the second vertical slit from the right), using standard driver‑forceps coordination: controlled needle passes, forceps‑assisted tissue presentation and retrieval, sequential knot tying and tail trimming, progressing the closure superiorly until the wound is spanned by a continuous series of tied interrupted stitches. The final appearance shows good overall apposition with modest irregularities in spacing and eversion; the absence of hands and needle in the final stills limits assessment of the very last knot sequences.
