COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on the vertical incision closest to the right edge of the suture pad. From the very first frames to the final image, all effort remains concentrated on this single linear wound, progressively closing it from its lower half upward with a consistent, systematic suturing technique. The other two vertical incisions visible on the pad are never engaged; instruments, tissue handling, and suture activity all remain confined to the right-sided cut.

The opening sequence shows careful setup and the first pass. With the incision exposed in the lower half, the left hand brings a needle driver in from above while the right hand, using Adson-style tissue forceps, lifts and everts the right wound margin. The needle is loaded properly at the proximal third of its curve, oriented perpendicular to the skin. The first bite is initiated on the right edge, a few millimeters from the margin, following the curve through the dermal layer. The right edge is stabilized and slightly everted by the forceps to present a crisp entry point and to control depth. From there, over the next several frames, the needle crosses the gap and exits on the left side, where the suture is drawn through in a controlled arc. The driver regrips the needle as needed to maintain the short working arc and cleanly deliver the suture, leaving a strand spanning the incision and setting up for the first knot.

Tying is performed with an instrument tie technique. The needle remains in the jaws of the needle holder as the right hand manages the free end and then alternately the standing part to build a secure square knot. The knot is seated just lateral to the wound line on the right side, keeping tension balanced across the incision to approximate the edges without blanching. No forceps are used during the tie; edge approximation at this moment depends on suture tension and the operator’s control of both ends. Once the knot is snug and centered over the gap, scissors are introduced to trim the tails. This completes the first stitch: the edges are drawn together along the lower portion of the right wound, and the excess suture is cut to an appropriate length. The knot sits neat and lateral, the edges opposed and beginning to show the desired slight eversion.

After completing that initial stitch, the operator repositions to continue along the same incision. A short pause for organization follows—the driver holds the needle parked above the knot while the assisting hand maintains gentle tension on the line—then the scissors return to polish the tail lengths and confirm the knot’s seat. With the first knot secured and trimmed, attention shifts a short distance superior along this same incision. A prior puncture or entry mark around the mid-section is visible, and the lower knot acts as a reference for spacing.

The next series of frames show methodical preparation for another stitch higher up on the same wound. The left hand again controls the needle driver; the right hand reintroduces the forceps on the lateral (right) wound margin, just superior to the existing knot. The needle is reloaded at the proximal third of its curve and aligned perpendicular to the skin surface, the tip presented exactly at the intended entry point on the right edge. The forceps lift the dermis to evert and expose the bite site, and the driver advances the needle with a short, controlled rotation. The thread trails out of the field in a way that keeps it organized and away from the tip of the driver.

A new pass is created through the right edge and then across to the left. The operator is disciplined about bite symmetry: the entry and exit points remain equidistant from the wound margin and at a consistent depth, matching the geometry of the first stitch below. The driver regrips near the needle’s swage when pulling suture through, an efficient maneuver that reduces torque at the needle-tissue interface and keeps the arc short. Once the pass is completed and the suture drawn across, setup for tying mirrors the first stitch. Instrument ties are laid with alternating throws; the right hand manipulates the free end while the driver’s jaws act as the post around which the loops are formed. The knot is squared, seated snugly, and the tails trimmed, adding a second discrete knot stack just above the first. Across these early closures, overt eversion is best achieved during needle passage with the Adson forceps; during tying, gentle traction brings the edges together without crushing.

Working steadily superior, the surgeon repeats the same pattern: stabilize the right wound edge with toothed forceps to present the dermis; align the needle perpendicular to the skin; take a small, symmetric bite through the right side, traverse the gap, and exit on the left; pull the suture through with a regrip near the swage to minimize tissue drag; then perform an instrument tie and cut. The hand positions remain consistent: the needle holder generally approaches from above or slightly lateral, and the forceps oppose it on the right edge, creating a compact working triangle that keeps instruments from crowding the wound. Occasionally the left hand takes the driver and the right hand the forceps; at other moments, especially during tying, the right hand manages the suture while the driver remains clamped on the needle. The alternation appears based on ergonomics and the direction of approach to the superior bite sites but does not alter the technique.

At points, there is minor variation in how the edges are managed during tying. In several sequences, forceps are not used during knot formation; the approximation depends on balanced traction. In others, the left fingers—not the forceps—press gently to seat the knot stack and confirm that adjacent bites lie flush without gapping. These small variations do not change the underlying approach: discrete, evenly spaced simple sutures closed with instrument ties and tails trimmed as each stitch is completed.

As the closure progresses into the mid-to-upper portion of the incision, the workflow becomes even more rhythmic. There are repeated cycles of preparation and placement: the forceps lifting the right edge to ensure eversion and consistent entry depth; the driver’s careful orientation and short wrist rotation to follow the needle’s curvature; the controlled draw of suture through; and then tying and trimming. The spacing among stitches remains consistent with aesthetic principles—close enough to prevent gaping, far enough to avoid strangulation—and the bite depths match each other from one stitch to the next, maintaining parallelism of entry/exit points. Where a prior stitch is already present, the next is positioned slightly superior with a steady cadence that builds an even series along the right edge of the wound.

Near the upper third, a hemostat appears parked superior to the field to manage a suture limb, keeping the standing part organized and out of the working path. This small efficiency helps keep the line tidy, reduces tangling, and improves visibility of the superior bite sites. The operator’s coordination is evident: when retrieving or regripping the needle, the driver crosses over the forceps without clashing, and the suture is drawn across the wound in a plane that avoids dragging over the skin surface. The wound edges are maintained without excessive manipulation; the forceps grasp lightly to protect tissue and to produce slight eversion as each entry is taken.

At one sequence toward the upper end, the left hand holds tension on the suture as the right hand drives and then retrieves the needle, producing the appearance of a “lock” as each throw is snugged down during knot formation. Despite the visual similarity to a running, locking ladder of loops, the subsequent frames and the final view confirm that this is not a continuous line; rather, it is a series of standard instrument-tied square knots seated individually on the right side of the incision. Each stitch is placed as a discrete pass across the wound and then secured. A momentary absence of forceps and the use of finger pressure to seat knots might contribute to the impression of a different pattern, but the closure remains a set of separate, evenly spaced interrupted stitches.

Approaching the very top of the incision, the technique remains unchanged. The left hand with the needle driver centers above the last open portion while the right hand applies precise counter-tension with the Adson forceps on the lateral edge. The needle is loaded at the proximal third, oriented orthogonally to the skin, and a final series of superior bites are placed with measured rotation. In some frames, after the needle’s passage, the driver deliberately grasps the suture near the swage to help pull through, minimizing drag and keeping the field clear. After each pass, the operator releases the needle, repositions for tying, and creates a neat, square knot stack. The scissors are then brought in from the superior or superolateral side to trim tails cleanly. During these final knots, the hands alternate duties smoothly: the right hand frequently switches from driver to scissors, while the left hand manages either the strand or direct finger pressure over the knot stack to seat it precisely.

Notably, throughout the entire procedure the spatial relationships are disciplined and consistent. The working distance is short and focused at the active bite site, generally within 1–2 cm of the top of the incision once the closure advances superiorly. The driver and forceps oppose each other over the wound; the driver frequently approaches from superior or from the patient’s right, while the forceps stabilize the right margin immediately adjacent to the intended entry. The suture is kept out of the way—sometimes trailed superiorly, sometimes corralled by a clamp—so that it neither obscures the view nor snags during needle passage or tying. The operator is careful not to disturb the completed stitches below, keeping their knot stacks tidy and avoiding excessive traction that might deform the already approximated segments.

By the penultimate sequences, a new stitch at the top is tightened, seated, and trimmed, bringing the closure nearly to completion. One more stitch is then placed at the very superior end: the forceps briefly evert the margin; the needle is passed with perpendicular alignment and minimal tissue trauma; the suture is drawn through and then tied with multiple instrument throws to secure a durable knot. The tails are cut short. Final touches involve gently pressing the knot stack to lie flush and inspecting the line for even spacing and consistent approximation.

The closing image captures the result: the right-side vertical incision is now bridged by several evenly spaced stitches, each with its own visible knot, all aligned along the lateral aspect of the wound. The edges are approximated without obvious gapping, and the previously open superior segment has been consolidated by the last one or two stitches. There is no new activity on the other incisions. A spare needle with attached suture lies idle on the lower left of the pad, away from the operative site, and a gloved hand hovers above the top of the closed line as if in post-procedure inspection. The wound shows neat, sequential closure along its length, with knot stacks uniformly seated on the right side, consistent bite depth and spacing from inferior to superior, and no signs of excessive blanching or tissue crushing.

Across the full procedure, the technique is consistent: small, symmetric bites across the wound taken with the needle oriented perpendicular to the skin; gentle eversion of the right edge with toothed forceps at the moment of entry; careful pull-through with regrips near the swage to protect tissue; and controlled instrument ties with alternating throws to produce square, secure knots. Intervals where the operator ties without forceps or uses finger pressure to seat knots reflect efficient variability rather than deviation from the plan. A brief appearance of ladder-like loops at one point is reconciled by later frames and the final state, which make clear that the closure consists of separate interrupted stitches rather than a continuous locking line. The final result is a neatly approximated incision with an even series of individual knots and well-aligned edges, reflecting a careful, stepwise closure of the single rightmost wound from its lower portion to the superior end.
