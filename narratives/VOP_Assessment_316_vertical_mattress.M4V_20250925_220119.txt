COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure targets the central vertical incision on the practice pad — the middle of three parallel, premarked vertical lines — and remains the sole focus for the entire sequence. The operator begins with setup and inspection, then proceeds through a methodical placement of skin sutures along the length of the central wound, advancing from initial needle introduction to sequential passes, knot securing, tensioning, trimming, and final inspection and instrument withdrawal.

0:00–0:14 — Preparation and assessment
At the outset the central incision sits cleanly marked with entry/exit dots but no suture yet engaged. Both hands are present in the workspace; the left hand moves medially across the pad while the right hand remains lateral and largely stationary. Instruments (needle driver, hemostat) rest on the instrument tray to the left. The wound is inspected and the operator positions themselves and the instruments for the first insertion. No needle handling or tissue manipulation occurs in these frames; this is a brief period of visual appraisal and instrument staging.

0:15–0:44 — First needle introduction and controlled first passes
Within the next interval the operator picks up the needle driver and a curved, swaged needle is introduced. Hand positions settle into a consistent bimanual pattern: the needle driver in the dominant hand approaches from above or from the left/cephalad aspect of the wound while fine toothed forceps or Adson-style pickups in the nondominant hand present, tent, and approximate the near edge. The needle is grasped near the mid‑shaft or proximal third (varies slightly by frame) rather than at the tip, permitting a controlled rotational arc. Passes are made with short wrist rotations rather than large arm movements. The nondominant forceps gently elevates and everts the dermal edge to present epidermis for a superficial to full‑thickness bite through the simulated dermis. The suture tail becomes visible as the needle is pulled through, indicating the first stitch has been passed and the operator is preparing to withdraw and manage the suture for knotting.

0:45–1:14 — Establishing pattern and in-line instrument coordination
The operator continues placing individual bites along the center incision. Hands remain close to the wound (tips within a few centimeters), with the needle driver generally superior/cephalad and the forceps inferior/caudal or lateral depending on the approach angle. The needle is repeatedly grasped near the swage or midshaft and delivered in controlled backhand or driver-mediated passes through the opposing edge. Tissue handling emphasizes atraumatic technique: forceps tent and align the wound edge, taking small dermal bites with minimal tension to avoid crushing the synthetic tissue. After each pass the suture is drawn through, and the operator repositions for the knot sequence or next bite. Early stitches are positioned to approximate the jagged or irregular edges of the central incision.

1:15–1:44 — Completing initial stitch sequences, knot control and trimming
As sutures accumulate, the operator alternates between inserting new bites and concentrating on securing previously placed stitches. At times a scissors/needle-holder style instrument (gold-handled scissors observed intermittently) is used for manipulation and tail trimming. The nondominant hand increasingly handles suture tails, controlling slack while the needle driver rotates and withdraws the needle. Frames in this range show knot-tying maneuvers and tail trimming: one instrument provides counter-traction on the knot while the other places subsequent throws or cuts the tail. Throughout, both hands remain immediately adjacent to the incision, with instruments crossing the wound axis as needed to complete ties.

1:45–2:14 — Continuing sequential placement and managing existing sutures
The operator proceeds to fill central gaps along the incision. Multiple previously placed interrupted sutures are visible along the wound; the working area shifts slightly along the incision as each new bite is added. Needle handling remains consistent — grasp near the midshaft, drive in an arc, and hand off to the opposite forceps as the tip exits. The nondominant forceps occasionally receives the needle tip and steadies tissue while the driver withdraws. There is careful attention to dermal capture rather than deep bites: passes are superficial to the skin analog’s depth, taking small, evenly spaced bites to bring the epidermal edges into close apposition and slight eversion, which promotes edge closure without inversion.

2:15–2:59 — Mid-procedure: dense activity, suture handling, and brief ambiguity
Throughout the middle portion there is a rhythm of pass–withdraw–tie that repeats as the operator traverses the central wound from one end toward the other. Both hands remain tightly coordinated: the needle driver often approaches from the cranial/upper-left quadrant and the forceps from the lateral or inferior side. A consistent feature is the secure grip on the needle, rotation through tissue with controlled arcs, and immediate management of the suture tail for tying. Around one segment (noted in a subset of frames), the visual impression briefly suggests a continuous progression of suture material along the wound; however, the operative actions remain consistent with placing and securing discrete bites in sequence. This likely reflects lengthy suture tails being managed or closely spaced interrupted bites rather than a formal continuous running technique. Regardless, the operator maintains the planned pattern by placing and securing individual stitches.

3:00–3:44 — Refinement of technique: tensioning, approximation and multiple passes
As more stitches are in place, the operator focuses on refining approximation and equalizing tension across the wound. Forceps in the nondominant hand are used not only to present tissue for needle passage but to manipulate and tension existing sutures during tying. The needle driver repositions frequently — sometimes grasping the needle more proximally for a broad arc, other times slightly nearer the tip to negotiate tighter angles at the jagged wound margins. The tactile sequence is deliberate: the needle arc enters the dermis on one side, exits the opposing margin, the suture is externalized and drawn snug, and the knot is secured with instrument-assisted throws. Throughout, the operator chooses superficial dermal purchase to avoid bulky deep bites and maintain smooth epidermal edge apposition.

3:45–4:29 — Focused central work, tie management, and occasional trimming
In this phase the operator concentrates on the central portion of the incision where gaps remain. Instrument interplay is frequent: the needle driver advances and the forceps receives; the forceps control tails while the driver delivers throws. A pair of small scissors is brought in intermittently to trim tails after knotting. Hands periodically cross over the incision plane to optimize angles. The repeated pattern — present/pinch, drive, withdraw, tension, tie — continues in a steady cadence. Tissue handling stays gentle: edges are approximated with slight eversion and minimal compression, preventing puckering or necrosis of the simulated skin edge.

4:30–4:59 — Final passes and instrument withdrawal
Toward the end of the sequence the operator places final stitches and secures remaining knots. The wound now shows a line of regularly spaced interrupted sutures approximating the epidermal edges along its length. The operator inspects each knot, adjusts tension where necessary, and trims tails. In several late frames both hands withdraw slightly as instruments are set aside. One of the last frames shows both hands pulling away from the pad and instruments being placed to the side, indicating procedural completion.

Technique details and evolution
- Needle grip and motion: From the first needle introduction the operator consistently grasps the curved, swaged needle near the mid‑shaft or proximal third. This grip, combined with short wrist rotations, allows consistent needle arcs and controlled passage through the dermal analog. In some frames the needle is held closer to the swage for greater control of curvature; in others the grip shifts more distal to negotiate tight entry/exit angles.
- Tissue handling: Fine toothed forceps/Adson pickups are used throughout to elevate and present the near edge, apply gentle counter-traction, and manage suture tails. This avoids tissue bunching and facilitates slight eversion of edges. The operator takes superficial-to-mid-dermal bites to ensure epidermal approximation without deep fascial engagement.
- Knot tying and tail management: The operator alternates between driving new passes and securing previous stitches. Knot formation is instrument-assisted; one instrument maintains tension on the suture while the other places throws and then trims the excess. At times a long hemostat or small scissors is used to manipulate or cut tails. The technique for securing knots remains consistent: establish pass, externalize suture, draw snug, instrument-tie, and trim.
- Consistency and minor deviations: For the majority of the video the approach is a sequential placement of individual interrupted skin sutures positioned to close the central vertical defect. There are brief visual moments where the suture material appears to run along the incision, but these are accompanied by tying and tail management actions that indicate discrete bites were being secured rather than a continuous running suture pattern. Overall, the operator maintains a steady, reproducible method from start to finish.

Hand position progression and spatial relationships
- Early: Hands start by approaching from opposing sides — the needle driver typically from the left/superior direction and forceps from the right/inferior side. Fingers are kept off the wound opening; instrument tips hover within a few centimeters of the incision.
- Mid-procedure: Hands maintain close proximity (generally within 1–5 cm of each other and the wound), instrument tips bracketing the incision axis. The driver often occupies a superior/medial position while the forceps occupy a lateral/inferior position. Instruments may cross over during needle transfer or knot tying.
- Late: As sutures accumulate, hand movements become more localized to the area being tied or trimmed. Final frames show gradual withdrawal of the hands and instruments to the table edge, indicating completion of the closure.

Final state of closure
By the end of the recording the central vertical incision is approximated along its length with a series of completed, instrument-secured interrupted skin sutures. Edges are brought into close apposition with slight eversion appropriate for epidermal edge alignment. Knots appear tightened and suture tails have been trimmed in the closing passes. The wound surface is smooth with no gross gaping; surrounding synthetic tissue shows minimal distortion due to atraumatic forceps handling. Instruments are withdrawn and set aside, and the operator completes a visual check of the closure line before concluding the procedure.

Summary
From initial inspection and instrument staging through steady, deliberate placement of individual skin sutures, the operator executes a focused and controlled skin closure on the central vertical incision. The workflow is characterized by consistent needle handling (midshaft grip, rotational arc), careful tissue presentation with fine forceps, instrument-assisted knot tying, and attentive suture tail management. Minor visual ambiguity suggesting a running segment is outweighed by repeated actions that demonstrate discrete bites being placed and secured sequentially. The result is a neatly approximated incision with securely tied and trimmed interrupted sutures, achieved through coordinated bimanual technique and incremental refinement of tension and alignment throughout the case.
