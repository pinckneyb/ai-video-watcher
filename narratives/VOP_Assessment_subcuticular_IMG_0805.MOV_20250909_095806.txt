Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
The work demonstrates steady hands, deliberate needle control, and respectful handling of tissue with consistent spacing and tension management. Instrument choreography is predictable and mostly efficient, with good use of the needle arc and forceps to evert and stabilize. However, the execution does not meet subcuticular standards. The closure lacks a continuous intradermal track, shows repeated epidermal punctures with surface knots, and finishes without a properly secured end, leaving the line puckered rather than flat. To reach competence for this technique, maintain the needle tip within the dermis parallel to the skin edge on every pass, avoid breaching the epidermis between the start and finish, keep bite length and depth uniform, and complete the closure with an appropriate subcuticular finish that leaves the skin surface smooth and planar.
