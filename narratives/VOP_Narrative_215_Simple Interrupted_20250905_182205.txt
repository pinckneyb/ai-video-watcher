COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with calm, deliberate setup. The left hand, in a standard ringed grip, loads the curved needle near its proximal third and hovers over the central incision. Opposite it, the right hand uses fine forceps to present the dermal edge, creating a stable working triangle over the wound. The needle tip is aligned perpendicular to the skin, angle and depth fine‑tuned before the first entry. Suture slack trails out of the field and remains untangled.

The first passes are demonstrated on a lateral incision. The left needle driver advances the needle in a smooth, wrist‑driven arc while the right forceps evert and steady the near edge. As the needle tip appears in the wound, the forceps capture it, assisting the pull‑through. The suture is drawn across and managed laterally to leave an adequate tail; the two hands separate momentarily while the right hand organizes slack.

With that rhythm established, the operator cycles through placement, tying, and trimming on adjacent incisions. After a stitch is passed and the suture positioned, the left hand briefly sets the needle holder aside to bring in scissors, cutting tails close to the knot line while the right hand stabilizes. Two clean, square knots become visible along the wound, tails trimmed short and directed away from the field. Throughout, the instruments remain parallel to the incision and work just above the tissue to preserve control and visibility.

Attention returns to the central incision. A near‑edge bite is initiated: the left hand drives the needle at approximately 90 degrees to the skin with a curvilinear wrist motion, while the right hand everts the edge and then reaches into the wound to grasp the emerging needle tip. In the next sequence, the pass is completed across both edges in one smooth arc, the needle is reloaded to optimize angle, and the suture is pulled through to leave a short tail. The scissors appear briefly, then the left hand returns to the driver for continued placement. A short pause allows the left hand to exchange the needle driver for scissors to trim a strand near the swage; the driver is reintroduced and the sequence continues without losing field organization.

Pass by pass, the technique remains consistent: perpendicular entries a few millimeters from the edge, symmetric depth, and gentle tip‑only handling with the forceps to encourage eversion. Suture loops and free ends are kept clear of the operative lane. The left hand advances the needle; the right hand retrieves and then manages tension. As a stitch is seated, the left hand transitions seamlessly into knot tying with the needle driver, while the right hand serves as a post on the free end. Throws are formed cleanly, alternating tension across the incision to square the knot and keep it centered; the wound edges approximate without blanching. The scissors return to trim tails flush to the knot line.

The flow settles into a steady cadence—load, present, drive, retrieve, pull through, tie, and trim—moving methodically along the central incision. There are moments devoted purely to housekeeping: precise reloading of the needle with the help of the pickups, orthogonal alignment of the grasp on the needle body, and intermittent trimming of previously tied suture tails. Each intervention is brief and purposeful, maintaining a clear field and uninterrupted progress.

Midway through, the technique transitions to a continuous sequence on the central incision. The left hand holds the needle driver over the suture line, maintaining gentle tension on the standing limb while the right hand orients the needle for the next entry. Without passing yet, the instruments meet just above the wound to set up the next bite. The very next moments show the needle again entering perpendicularly and sweeping across; the right hand briefly captures the tip on exit, and the left regrips to draw the needle and suture through. Bites remain equidistant and at matched depth, and slack is controlled so the running loops lie tidy across the midline without strangulation. The forceps continue to present the edge ahead of each pass, and the driver operates just to the superior/central side, hands rarely colliding.

As the run approaches its endpoint, the left hand keeps the needle clamped within the driver while performing an instrument tie—looping around the right‑hand instrument or suture end, retrieving the tail, and alternating direction to square each throw. The right hand alternates between pickups and scissors, briefly crossing into the midline to set the knot and then returning laterally to cut the tails. The standing limb remains stabilized as each throw is cinched, seating the knot centrally over the incision.

The final sequence is devoted to grooming the closure. The right hand lifts individual suture ends near their knots with pickups, presenting them at a safe angle, while the left hand brings scissors straight down to cut. Cuts are deliberate and close, with the blades kept off the skin. After the last tail is trimmed, both instruments withdraw, revealing a neatly closed wound line with evenly spaced, square knots and short, uniform tails. The field is clean, edges are well approximated with gentle eversion, and the tempo of the entire session—from first needle alignment through final tail cut—has been consistent, economical, and controlled.
