COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The camera opens on a central vertical skin simulator incision slightly right of the pad’s midline. Several interrupted stitches have already been placed in the upper portion of the wound, leaving a middle-to-inferior segment open for closure. From the outset the operator works within a compact, repeated two‑instrument pattern: a needle driver in the dominant hand and tissue forceps/hemostat in the nondominant hand. Instruments converge over a narrow working zone and the operator advances a curved surgical needle in short, controlled arcs, taking superficial-to-full‑thickness bites of the synthetic dermis to bring the opposing edges toward one another.

Early maneuvers (0–60 s)
At the beginning of the sequence the needle driver approaches from above/left while the forceps provide counter‑traction from the right. The needle is grasped not at the extreme tip but along the shaft—usually in the mid‑to‑proximal third—so the driver can rotate the needle through a precise arc. The assistant or opposite hand lifts and presents the lateral wound edge with fine forceps; bites are placed close to the epidermal margin to approximate cutaneous layers. After each passage the suture is pulled through and held for knot formation. Initial activity alternates between passing a new bite and manipulating/tensioning a recently passed stitch for tying; the operator keeps the hands tightly coupled (often within a few centimeters) to allow tight control of needle trajectory and suture tension. Edges are approximated with a slight eversion as knots are taken.

Progression into mid-inferior segment (60–180 s)
Working sequentially, the operator places additional interrupted stitches along the same vertical line. The hands remain in the same complementary arrangement: needle driver delivering the needle from a cephalad or lateral approach, forceps holding the near edge and managing tails. Needle passes are shallow and controlled — frequently dermal-to-epidermal bites on the training pad — and the operator frequently re‑grasps the suture and tightens loops before completing throws. Knot‑management steps appear in several frames: loops are brought to hand, suture tails are tensioned using a hemostat or fingers, and redundant tails are prepared for trimming. As new bites are added the operator systematically advances caudally along the incision; previously placed stitches maintain apposition and prevent gaping while the next stitch is prepared.

Consistent instrument choreography and needle technique characterize this portion of the case. The needle is commonly held near the swaged end or mid‑shaft to provide leverage during rotation, and the curve consistently points toward the wound to permit smooth passage from lateral to medial or from one edge to the other. Forceps are used to evert and present the tissue, producing the slight outward roll of each bite seen repeatedly in the frames. When stitches are being tied, the nondominant hand often shifts to hold the suture tails or to use a hemostat for knot pushing while the dominant hand controls the driver for the next pass.

Mid‑procedure refinement and small variations (180–360 s)
As the series progresses, the operator alternates between placing new interrupted stitches and finishing previously passed suture loops. There are frequent instrument crossings: the needle driver approaches from above while the forceps come from below or from the opposite lateral side; sometimes the left hand places a clamp on the tail to maintain tension while the right hand rotates the needle through tissue. The operator tends toward short, controlled needle arcs rather than wide swings, keeping bites consistent in depth and placement adjacent to the existing knot row.

At several intervals the procedure shows small variations in support technique: a long hemostat is used to control a suture tail while the other hand advances a new pass; at other times the nondominant hand stabilizes tissue with a fingertip rather than forceps. These subtle changes reflect typical intraoperative adaptation—managing suture tails, alternating which hand receives the needle, and staging knot throws—while maintaining the same overall stitch pattern down the length of the wound. Even during tie completion and trimming, the needle driver remains close to the wound so the operator can quickly resume passing the next stitch.

Occasional deeper handling and suture management (360–480 s)
Through the mid‑to‑late portion of the video the operator continues to place stitches in sequence along the same vertical incision. The technique remains consistent: needle grips near the shaft, forceps presenting edges with tip-only traction, and bites that bring the dermal layers into alignment with gentle eversion. A few frames show the needle being withdrawn after a pass and the suture tail being externalized so the knot can be formed; other frames highlight final tightening and trimming of tails, with hands alternately providing counter‑traction and knot control.

A notable observation in this interval is a transient presence of a continuous‑appearing segment on the right side of the line in some frames. Where it appears, the operator is seen advancing suture thread through consecutive bites in a running fashion and tensioning a column of stitches. This contrasts with the predominant interrupted, mattress‑style approach evident elsewhere, so it is called out as an inconsistency in application rather than a change in intent: most passes and knot‑forming sequences remain interrupted in character and are handled with the same needle‑and‑forceps choreography as earlier. After these brief continuous passes the operator resumes interrupted passes and tying maneuvers on subsequent portions of the wound.

Needle positioning and hand changes
Across the whole case, the dominant hand alternates its point of approach (top/left, top/right, or directly above) depending on the working segment and the angle needed to pass the curved needle. The nondominant hand shifts between pinching the near edge with forceps, holding suture tails with a hemostat, and occasionally placing a fingertip on the pad to stabilize tissue. When completing a knot the secondary hand often comes inferior or lateral to the stitch to maintain tail orientation and prevent entanglement; when placing a fresh bite the same hand presents and slightly everts the tissue. Instrument tips cross over the incision axis repeatedly, enabling the needle driver to deliver the needle at a favorable angle while the opposing instrument receives or steadies the needle as it exits.

Technical consistency and stitch character
Throughout the sequence the operator consistently takes relatively superficial but full‑thickness simulator bites that approximate the dermal edges with slight eversion—an approach optimized for skin approximation on this model. Needle grips remain conservative (mid‑shaft to near the swage), favoring control over reach. The operator repeatedly uses two‑handed coordination: a driver to drive and rotate the needle, and forceps/hemostat to present tissue and manage the suture tail. Knotting technique is iterative—after each pass the operator pulls the suture through, forms the loop, tensions the throw(s), and then trims or arranges tails before moving to the next position.

During tying and suture management the hands come very close together, and the operator routinely re‑grasps the needle or repositions instruments to maintain ergonomic control. At times the needle is pulled through and the driver is held outside the pad to prepare for the next pass; in the final frames the loaded driver rests just outside the lower-right corner of the pad poised to re-enter, indicating a methodical, staged approach to completing the closure.

Handling irregularities and edge apposition
While the general pattern is one of consistent interrupted bites and sequential progression along the line, small imperfections are visible at times. Between some stitches there are tiny residual gaps or slight overlapping of edges before final tying; although knots and subsequent tightening reduce these, the final line is not “perfectly” apposed in every location. These small variations likely reflect incremental tightening after each knot and the limitations inherent in a synthetic model. Overall, however, the operator repeatedly draws the edges into alignment with slight eversion, consistent with the intended cutaneous closure technique.

Late procedure maneuvers and readiness for completion (480–590 s)
In the closing portion of the video the stitch line shows a near‑continuous column of placements—older knots are secure and newer stitches are being added adjacent to them. The operator continues the same grasping and rotational needle technique, moving sequentially along the wound. There are sequences of knot tightening and suture tail handling, alternating with fresh passes; on occasion a finger is used to stabilize the pad while the needle is withdrawn and the tail tensioned.

In the very final frames the field shows a column of interrupted mattress‑style stitches with adjacent simple interrupted stitches along the length of the incision. The loaded needle driver rests outside the pad to the right, tip oriented toward the wound as if poised for one more pass. The forceps and other clamps lie idle to the left of the pad or just outside the working quadrant, consistent with a stage of completion where most bites are placed and only final tensioning or a last stitch remains.

Final appearance and operative assessment
At the end of the sequence the wound is approximated along its entire length by a sequence of sequential, closely spaced sutures. Edges exhibit modest eversion from the mattress‑style and interrupted configuration, and most gaps have been closed by knot tightening; where minute irregularities persist there is visual evidence of slight overlapping or small residual gaps between stitches. Sutures appear to traverse the full‑thickness of the simulator dermis, and the operator has maintained a disciplined two‑instrument technique throughout: the needle driver controlling needle delivery and rotation, and the opposing instrument presenting tissue, holding tails, or providing counter‑traction during knot formation.

Throughout the video the practitioner adheres to a repetitive, efficient workflow: prepare and present the near edge, grasp and drive the needle through the far edge with the driver held near its shaft, externalize the suture, tension and tie the knot with coordinated hand movements, and then reposition for the next bite. Hand positions evolve responsively to the immediate need (needle passage vs. knot‑tying), but never depart from the tight, close‑quarters coordination necessary for accurate skin approximation.

Observations on technique fidelity
The principal technique applied is interrupted, mattress‑style and adjacent simple interrupted suturing along the single vertical incision slightly right of center. In a few frames a running segment appears transiently, representing a brief deviation from the interrupted pattern; otherwise the operator consistently uses interrupted bites with individual knotting. When deviations occur they are limited and quickly return to the interrupted mattress/simple interrupted pattern that defines the closure strategy. Needle handling — mid‑shaft grasps, controlled rotations, and shallow-to-full‑thickness bites with slight eversion — remains consistent, and instrument roles stay clear and complementary throughout.

In summary, the closure progresses methodically from the initially sutured superior segment through the mid and inferior portions of the same vertical incision. The operator uses a disciplined two‑hand technique to pass the curved needle, approximate and evert the edges, tension knots, and trim/arrange tails. By the end of the recording the incision is largely closed with a continuous column of sewn, everted tissue and residual minor irregularities corrected by sequential tightening; instruments rest poised for final tightening or one last pass, reflecting a near‑complete, controlled skin closure.
