COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video documents a suturing practice on a three‑incision silicone skin pad. There are three parallel vertical slits: one on the right that already carries a line of simple interrupted sutures, a central vertical wound with multiple interrupted stitches but persistent gaps at its lower end, and a long left‑sided incision that begins with no sutures and is used repeatedly for needle handling practice. Despite periodic attention to the left and right cuts, the closure described centers on the central wound: its inferior gap is inspected, tails are trimmed, and instruments are repeatedly positioned to place the next interrupted stitch. No new knot is actually completed on that line during the captured intervals, and the final state shows four completed simple‑interrupted sutures on the central wound. What follows is a chronological account linking each sequence into a coherent story of technique and hand choreography, while tracking counts and progress unambiguously.

The session opens with setup and tissue preparation away from the eventual target line. At the leftmost incision, the team trims the thickened inferior skin edge. The right hand uses forceps to lift and steady the lower lip while the left hand alternates scissors and a needle driver to debride a small wedge and then bring in a loaded curved needle. The needle is grasped roughly two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the pad, aimed to enter at the inferior end of the left cut. This brief preparatory interlude establishes instrument control and edge presentation but does not yet involve closure; no suture is passed across that left wound in these early frames, and there are zero completed stitches visible there.

Attention then swings to the right wound, which already bears a neat row of simple interrupted sutures. Here the activity is largely setup: a needle driver holds a curved needle at the body (about two‑thirds from the tip) in the lower‑right quadrant, the forceps approach to probe and align the wound edge, and scissors briefly enter the field. The tools are oriented to place another stitch near the inferior end, but no bite is taken and no knot is tied in this segment. The right incision shows four completed interrupted sutures; this number remains stable through several returns to the right side. The needle is occasionally reloaded by the left hand while the right hand uses forceps to align the needle tip; manipulation is gentle and the existing sutures maintain approximation with mild eversion, so tissue handling is minimal.

After this early instrument loading over the right wound, the team finally turns to the midline incision—the one that will be the focus of closure work. At the central wound’s lower end, the right hand uses Adson‑type forceps to stabilize and evert the left dermal edge while the left hand brings in suture scissors or a driver. The primary action is trimming and tidying: tails from prior simple interrupted sutures are tensioned, inspected, and shortened. This produces a cleaner field at the inferior portion of the midline wound. By the end of this tail‑trimming run, five completed simple interrupted sutures are visible along the midline incision, with the lowermost neighborhood being adjusted. No new needle pass is made during this trimming—the forceps hold and evert the edge and the other instrument trims tails at the corner of the wound.

Immediately afterward, work begins at the inferior pole of the central slit for another interrupted stitch. The right hand again grips the patient’s left margin with Adson forceps, lifting and everting the epidermal edge to present dermis. The left hand positions a needle driver just lateral to the lower left corner of the wound, needle grasped at its proximal third, arc perpendicular to the skin so the tip can dive through the left dermis in a standard outside‑in bite. The instruments oppose each other across the gap, tips converging squarely perpendicular to the incision line—classic simple interrupted technique. The sequence shows positioning and an entry bite being taken at the bottom of the central wound; however, no knot is tied during this sequence. In this view, four completed interrupted sutures are clearly visible on the central line, with a gap at the inferior third where the next stitch is planned. Differences in count between this and the prior trimming sequence reflect what is clearly visible in each shot; critically, there is still no added knot completed on the central wound at this stage.

The scene then cuts away from the midline to a series of extended practice passes on the long left incision. Across multiple segments, the left wound is engaged repeatedly at its superior and inferior ends, but each time the action represents needle entry or passage without completion of a knot. The right hand—with forceps—everts and steadies the near edge; the left hand advances a curved needle grasped somewhere between one‑third from the swaged end and two‑thirds from the tip, always keeping it perpendicular to the skin so it rides the curvature through the dermis. Initially the needle enters the near (left) edge; later sequences show it traversing to or across the far edge at the wound’s top; even one pass completes both sides. Despite these passes, the suture is never tied and no cut ends are seen on the left wound throughout. At the apex, the forceps guide and retrieve the emerging needle; at the inferior segment the driver re‑grips the needle intra‑wound to control rotation. Tissue handling is careful: the forceps tent the dermis slightly to control bite depth, the driver backs the needle out in small arcs, and the edges are kept everted. Yet the closure is intentionally deferred—the left incision remains without completed stitches in all these frames.

With that practice achieved, the team returns to the right wound for housekeeping and brief setup. The right hand alternates between forceps and scissors over the right incision, tensioning suture strands to inspect puckering and then trimming tails. The left hand sometimes holds a needle driver elsewhere near the top of the pad or stabilizes the substrate. The right wound’s edges are already approximated, mild eversion maintained by the existing line, and no new bites are taken. The count on the right side remains four completed simple interrupted sutures. Soon after, the instruments again hover over this same line with a needle driver holding a curved needle at the proximal third of the arc. The suture thread trails across the field; the forceps or a second driver in the opposite hand aligns the needle so the arc is perpendicular to the incision. The tips oppose each other across the line, targeting the lower portion of the wound. Edges are gently approximated with the instrument tips to emphasize eversion at the inferior segment. Even here, however, a new knot is not completed—the team is rehearsing the set‑up for another interrupted stitch without executing it during these frames.

Once more the left incision is used briefly to initiate another pass. The needle driver, approaching from the left/top‑left, holds the curved needle perpendicular to the pad and takes a bite at the superior end; the right hand’s forceps present and slightly evert the margin. Thread is drawn through the pass, giving the impression of progress, yet knot tying is again withheld in these views. At no point are completed knots formed on the left wound, so this long incision remains entirely without completed sutures through the end of the captured sequences.

The final image returns decisively to the midline—the wound of interest. The right hand is visible in the upper‑right, holding a needle driver with a curved needle grasped at mid‑curve, tip angling toward the pad, suitable for the next dermal bite across the central wound. The left hand is not in frame; no forceps are currently elevating tissue. The silicone edges along the central slit rest in approximation from prior stitches, with uneven spacing and somewhat untidy tails—a useful picture of an in‑progress, didactic build of simple interrupted closures where knot quality and spacing are still being refined. In this final frame, four completed interrupted sutures are visible along the central wound. The leftmost incision is untouched in this final glance; the right incision, lateral to the active site, appears orderly and already completed, consistent with earlier housekeeping alone on that line.

Throughout the session, hand positions relative to the central wound evolve with task. When trimming tails at the lower end of the midline, the right hand used Adson forceps to stabilize the left dermal edge, while the left hand approached from the patient’s left with scissors to snip tails—an arrangement that keeps the cutting hand clear of the tissue being tensioned. During attempts to initiate the next stitch at the inferior third, the right hand maintained tissue control with the forceps on the left edge to ensure eversion; the left hand held the needle driver lateral to the incision, the needle oriented perpendicular to penetrate through the left flap and arc toward the right side. In the last frame, the right hand alone hovers with the driver above the wound, the left hand out of view—no bimanual tensioning is occurring at that instant as the team pauses just before the next pass.

Technique is consistent whenever the team sets up a stitch on the central line. The needle is always loaded near the proximal third to mid‑curve to maximize arc control and minimize torque on the dermis. Each planned bite is oriented perpendicular to the skin surface, with the forceps providing just enough epidermal edge purchase to lift and evert without crushing. The planned trajectory is symmetric across the incision to yield even depth and width, which supports eversion when tied. The suture is drawn across the field with attention to keeping the strand free of tangles. On the right and left incisions—used mainly for instrument calibration and practice—the same principles are evident: careful eversion, perpendicular needle path, and controlled re‑grasping of the needle as it exits to complete the turn.

Suture progression and counting for the central wound merit special, explicit tracking. Early in the central sequence—during tail trimming at the inferior end—five completed interrupted sutures are visible. Immediately after, while preparing and initiating the next bite at the bottom, four completed sutures are clearly visible in the frames. No knot is tied in that sequence, and none is tied in the final image either. The last frame again shows four completed interrupted sutures on the central line. Given that no additional knots are completed at any time in the captured midline segments, the most reliable and definitive count is the one visible in the final view: four.

It is also important context that the neighboring incisions do not change their counts. The right wound repeatedly shows four completed interrupted sutures; actions on that line consist of reloading the needle for a potential pass and trimming/inspecting existing tails, but no new suture is added. The left wound—used for multiple needle placements—never shows a tied knot; all visible actions are single‑edge entries or across‑wound passes without completion, leaving the count at zero on that line throughout the observed shots.

Putting the full story together, the closure work advances the central wound toward completion without yet adding another knot. The inferior third of the midline is the persistent target: edges are everted, needle and driver alignments are rehearsed, and the field is cleaned by trimming previous tails. The hands operate predictably: the forceps hand presents tissue on the near edge; the driver hand sets up perpendicular passes, re‑grasping as needed. Parallel activity on the right and left incisions serves as either housekeeping (right) or needle handling practice (left), not as active closure that would change counts.

Final state and verification:
- Final frame shows the central vertical wound with four completed simple interrupted sutures, unevenly spaced, and untidy tails—a work in progress with the next bite being set up but not yet taken.
- Over the course of the video, no additional knots are completed on this central wound; the visible count fluctuates between four and five in different views but returns to four at the end.
- The right wound maintains four completed sutures with occasional tail trimming; no new stitches are added there during these sequences.
- The left wound has no completed sutures; it is used to practice entry and across‑wound passes without tying.

Mandatory suture count verification:
- Total number of completed sutures visible on the wound being closed at the end of the procedure: 4 completed interrupted sutures on the central vertical wound.
- Progression: early midline trimming reveals five visible; later operating views and the final frame show four; no new knots are added during the captured intervals, so the final, verified count remains four.

In sum, the video chronicles meticulous setup and technique rehearsal centered on finishing the inferior portion of the central incision with simple interrupted suturing. The operator consistently uses proper bimanual control, perpendicular needle orientation, and gentle eversion. The final image confirms the current stage: four completed sutures secure the midline, with instruments poised to place the next stitch, but without a newly tied knot within the recorded frames.
