COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence opens with a deliberate, right‑hand–dominant setup on a synthetic skin pad bearing three short vertical incisions. The surgeon loads the curved needle in the needle driver at the proximal-to-middle third, while the left hand, holding Adson forceps, stabilizes and everts the near dermal edge. With the needle perpendicular to the skin, a smooth wrist rotation drives a full-thickness bite across the leftmost incision from right to left. The driver briefly regrips the needle after emergence to complete the pull-through. The suture trails cleanly out of the way as the edges come into gentle approximation; no knot is tied yet.

As the first pass settles, the right hand releases and reloads the needle, this time on the distal third from the tip, and reorients to keep the curve perpendicular to the next intended entry. The left hand sets the forceps down and transitions to managing the free suture limb outside the field, keeping it clear while the right hand returns to the wound. By the end of this setup, the needle is poised at the near edge, the suture tail laid to the left, ready for tying.

The surgeon then shifts into an instrument tie. The left hand becomes the anchor, holding the static end low and left, while the right hand uses the needle driver as a tying instrument. The driver alternately wraps, grasps the working end, and draws throws down, with tension vectors opposing—right hand pulling up and rightward, left hand down and leftward—to seat the knot directly over the puncture site. The needle remains parked on the strand and out of play while the throws are stacked. Once the knot is snug and centered, the driver is set down and the left hand checks the lay of the knot with a gentle press.

With the first stitch secured, attention moves to the central short incision. The right hand picks up the needle driver; the left hand takes Adson forceps again. The needle is loaded at about the proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the pad, and advanced across the incision with controlled rotational motion. The left forceps lift and evert each margin just ahead of the needle tip, guiding a full-thickness purchase on both near and far edges. Throughout, the driver approaches from the right/superior side, the forceps from the left/inferior side, meeting over the wound while keeping the suture line arcing safely away from the tips.

Without changing the field, the surgeon transitions directly into tying over this central bite. The left hand keeps the forceps at the left edge to steady tissue and occasionally to present the short tail; the right hand, now manipulating only suture with the driver, forms loops, grasps the tail, and pulls it through. The first throw is cinched with the hands separating laterally—left hand drawing the tail outward, right hand drawing the standing limb to the opposite side—seating the knot while maintaining approximation. Subsequent throws are built the same way, the driver tip staying low and centered over the knot, crossing in front of the forceps when retrieving the tail. As the knot stacks, the forceps are set aside; the left hand switches to fingertip control of the suture while the right hand alternates loop directions to create square throws. The final snug is a smooth, coordinated slide-down of the knot onto the incision.

With two stitches in place, the surgeon begins the next placement. The right hand, again with the needle driver, occasionally parks the instrument at the top of the field to clear working space, then re-enters with the needle reloaded at the junction of the distal and middle third of its curve. The tip is aimed squarely at the near edge, perpendicular to the skin. The left hand initially corrals the free suture with fingers, then upgrades to Adson forceps to grasp and gently evert the near dermal edge. The driver initiates a rotational drive through the near edge at a consistent offset from the wound margin. The suture stays slack and out of the driver’s arc; within this sequence only the near-edge penetration is visible, suggesting a methodical, staged pass across the wound.

Once the purchase is complete and the needle is set aside at the field margin, tying resumes. The right hand uses the driver solely on the suture strands, and the left hand alternates between forceps stabilization and fingertip control of the short tail. Throws are formed immediately adjacent to the wound, the driver staying low to minimize lift on the tissue. Loop direction alternates to build a secure square knot stack, with each throw advanced down under opposing, controlled tension so the knot remains centered and the edges remain approximated without blanching or distortion. A brief appearance of scissors or a hemostat near the knot suggests preparation for trimming, but tying continues until the stack is complete.

The final tying sequence shows the same rhythm and economy: the needle is parked laterally, loops are formed just above the wound line, and the two hands separate in opposite directions to set each throw while the knot remains coaxed to the midline. By now, three simple interrupted stitches are seated neatly over the midline closure.

The procedure concludes with tail trimming. The left hand elevates each set of free ends from the most superior knot while the right hand introduces scissors from the superior-right, tips close to the knot and parallel to the skin. Tails are cut short in succession, leaving compact, tidy knots with tissue alignment unchanged. The instruments withdraw, revealing a clean series of evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures, each placed with consistent needle loading, precise rotational passes, and calm, alternating instrument ties that give the whole sequence a steady pass–tie–trim cadence.
