Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Final count on the right vertical wound in the image: 4 completed simple interrupted sutures. This matches the closing frames of the video. The line shows acceptable approximation centrally with slight eversion but leaves an excessive inferior gap that should have been closed before stopping.
