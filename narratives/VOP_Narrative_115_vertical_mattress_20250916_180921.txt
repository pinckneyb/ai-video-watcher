COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The footage documents a focused, methodical closure of the central vertical incision on a silicone suture pad using a simple interrupted technique. Two parallel practice slits lie to either side of this midline wound; at times they are visible but remain unused for the primary closure. Throughout, the operator returns to the same midline laceration, placing, tying, and trimming individual stitches in sequence and steadily advancing toward the inferior end. The other incisions occasionally appear in view—sometimes even being manipulated with a continuous technique—but those interludes are separate practice segments and are not part of the midline interrupted closure described here.

Field and setup
- The primary wound is a straight vertical slit in the middle of the pad. Its edges are already slightly everted by earlier stitches when the video opens, and the superior half of the incision is progressively well approximated as the procedure advances.
- The operator predominantly uses a needle driver (holder), Adson/tissue forceps, and suture scissors. Orientation is consistent: the needle is grasped about one-third from the swaged end to mid‑body, with the curve oriented roughly perpendicular to the skin surface; bites are symmetrical across wound edges.
- Hands are opposed across the incision to create a stable working triangle. The “post” hand stabilizes the suture during knot tying, while the working hand drives the needle or forms throws. The driver is often centered over the midline; the forceps typically approach the right wound edge to present tissue and to assist with eversion and loop control.

Early progress: establishing the next stitches
- After an initial survey where several completed stitches are already visible superiorly, the operator sets up additional bites in the lower half of the midline wound. The right-hand forceps present and gently evert the right wound edge; the left-hand driver loads the needle at its proximal third and enters the dermis perpendicularly. Passes are executed with controlled wrist rotation, traversing from near to far side and exiting in mirror fashion, preserving symmetry and eversion.
- In one early sequence, four completed interrupted stitches are present in the superior segment. A new bite is taken in the lower third (the needle is driven across while the forceps hold the right edge). The suture is then drawn through and organized to prepare for tying.
- Immediately thereafter, the team transitions to knot formation. The needle is parked, and the driver is used to form instrument ties. The assisting hand manages the free suture end, sometimes switching to a second driver for two-instrument tying. Throws are laid with the driver held vertically over the midline, and knots are seated squarely over the incision. Tails are trimmed close to the knot with scissors introduced from the inferior or left side, crossing the wound to cut flush without nicking adjacent tissue.

Advancing the line: fifth and sixth stitches secured
- With five completed stitches now visible along the upper half, attention turns to the lower‑mid portion. A fresh pass is placed, then the needle is parked while instrument ties are performed. The right hand posts the standing end, and the left hand uses the driver to throw loops and cinch the knot, seating it neatly over the midline. Scissors pass across the wound axis and trim near the knot. The count advances to six completed stitches.
- Across several sequences, the operator repeats this pattern: controlled needle placement, careful tissue presentation with Adsons, and instrument ties. The wound edges remain coapted; only brief, gentle lifts with forceps are used to maintain slight eversion and precise alignment. No deep bites are taken, and there is no crush injury to the synthetic skin.
- Suture handling is tidy. The strand frequently trails to the patient’s right and inferiorly during tying, kept away from previously placed knots. When evident slack is present after a pass, the operator tensions the line deliberately before securing the knot, preventing “air knots” and ensuring each throw is locked down at the skin surface.

Refining technique: consistent instrument ties and careful trimming
- As more stitches accumulate along the midline, the operator leans on instrument ties with a needle driver as the active tool, sometimes using a second driver or forceps to serve as the post. Throws are alternated to lock the knot, and the final throw is cinched with deliberate, even tension across the plane of the wound rather than upward hoisting, which preserves edge apposition.
- The scissors are introduced with intention: the tips approach from inferior-left or inferior-right, cross under the driver if needed, and cut tails short and tidy. At times, the operator pauses to trim earlier knots, cleaning the field. These finishing passes occur without disturbing the superior stitches, which remain undisturbed and aligned.

Adding the next stitch at the inferior end
- With six completed stitches visible along the central incision, the operator moves into the lower-middle to inferior segment and places another bite. The forceps lift the right edge just lateral to the wound line for purchase and eversion; the driver, centered over the wound and slightly superior to the planned entry point, advances the needle perpendicularly through the dermal margin and across to the opposite side. The suture is pulled through, the stand is tensioned, and the needle is parked as loops are formed.
- The sequence then shows the stitch being tightened but, in some views, not yet fully secured and cut. The operator uses efficient alternating throws to snug the knot down, keeping the knot centered on the wound line. When the assistant’s hand is present, it steadies the strand just right of midline to maintain tension as the tying hand alternates loops. The driver’s tip is aligned with the incision axis during this maneuver, minimizing lateral torque on the tissue.

Intermittent finishing passes and count confirmation
- Several interludes show finishing activities over the same midline wound: grasping suture ends with forceps to tension, instrument ties with one or two drivers, and systematic trimming of tails. During these, no new tissue bites are added; rather, knots are confirmed and the line is groomed. The incision edges remain well approximated, and the spatial relationship of instruments is consistent—drivers and scissors remain parallel to the wound axis, crossing as needed during ties and cutting.
- Occasional tightening sequences show the driver used as the primary tensioning instrument while the opposite hand controls the free end; at other moments, roles swap—reflecting ambidextrous comfort. In every case, the working hand keeps to the midline with minimal excursions beyond a few millimeters, evidencing economy of motion.

Notes on cutaways and inconsistencies
- The assembled clips include brief cutaways to a separate right‑of‑center incision where a continuous/running closure is manipulated (tensioned, advanced, or trimmed). These cutaways show a different suture pattern, occasionally mid‑to‑late sequence with multiple running bites already in place and no new midline interrupted bites being formed. They are separate from the midline interrupted closure and are not part of the counted line for this procedure. Where these appear, they are best interpreted as parallel practice segments interleaved into the reel. Consistent with the designated technique for the primary closure, the narrative, technique assessment, and stitch count below pertain to the central midline interrupted repair only.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
- Early and mid‑sequence, the left hand commonly holds the needle driver above the incision while the right hand manages the forceps at the right wound edge. This orientation supports an efficient right‑edge eversion maneuver as the needle is driven across.
- During knot tying, the right hand often becomes the post (either with a driver or holding the free strand), while the left hand performs loops with the driver. At times, this configuration reverses, but the principles remain: one hand stabilizes tension, the other executes precise throws, and both hands stay close and parallel to the incision to keep the knot centered.
- Scissors typically approach from the inferior or left side; tips cross the wound to cut tails flush. When two drivers are used, they operate like a matched pair: one acts as the fixed post directly over the midline, the other passes loops and advances the knot, then both hands converge to cinch and finally separate to release tension.

Technique consistency across the closure
- The closure remains a sequence of simple interrupted stitches along the central midline wound. Each stitch begins with careful tissue presentation—using Adsons to evert the near edge—and perpendicular needle entry for vertical, symmetric bites. The needle is clamped at the proximal third to mid‑body, with deliberate, controlled wrist rotation to carry the arc through the dermis. The far edge is engaged at a mirrored depth to maintain uniform bite size and to avoid dog‑ears or step‑offs.
- On tying, instrument knots are formed with alternating throws for security. The operator avoids over‑tightening, protecting against tissue strangulation; knots sit squarely over the incision with short tails. When the needle is briefly parked during ties, it is laid to the right side or secured in a driver to keep the working field organized and to prevent inadvertent needle sticks.

Suture progression and count tracking
- The closure begins with several stitches already present in the superior half of the midline wound. The next stitch is placed in the lower third and tied, moving the count forward (four completed advancing to five).
- Subsequent sequences show another stitch placed and secured in the lower‑mid segment, bringing the total to six. The superior half now appears evenly spaced and neatly approximated; the operator continues distally.
- Additional tying sequences depict the placement and locking of another stitch. Some views record a seventh knot being formed and seated; other views shortly thereafter show that stitch still being tightened or not yet cut. The operator maintains consistent technique across these steps, and earlier knots remain undisturbed.
- Importantly, while some clips suggest seven completed stitches at one point, the last clear, on‑line view of the midline interrupted closure shows six completed knots with the next stitch being tied but not yet trimmed. For a conservative and accurate accounting, only fully finished stitches are counted in the final tally.

Final state and verification
- By the end of the midline interrupted closure shown in the final on‑line views, the central incision displays six completed simple interrupted stitches with well‑approximated, slightly everted edges along the superior to mid portion. A seventh stitch is in progress at the inferior end—its knot is being formed/tensioned—but the tails are not yet cut.
- Final suture count (explicit): The procedure results in 6 completed simple interrupted sutures visible on the central midline incision. The next stitch is partially completed (tying underway) but is not counted as finished because it is not yet trimmed and seated in the final frame set.
- Progression summary:
  - Initial working state (early placement): approximately 4 completed stitches, then a fifth is added and tied.
  - Mid‑sequence consolidation: a sixth stitch is added and tied; intermittent trimming of prior knots occurs.
  - Later tying: a seventh stitch is started and, in some views, appears seated; however, the final verifiable frames of this midline interrupted closure show six completed with the seventh not yet trimmed; therefore, six is the confirmed, conservative final count.

Overall impression
- The operator exhibits consistent, safe technique characteristic of simple interrupted skin closure: perpendicular needle entry, symmetric bites for edge eversion, disciplined instrument ties with proper alternating throws, and careful tail trimming. Hand positions adapt fluidly to maintain a stable working triangle across the incision, with minimal crossing or crowding. The wound edges are approximated evenly without overtension, and the line appears clean and orderly by the end.
- While the compiled footage includes occasional cutaways to a separate right‑of‑center continuous/running suture line (with its own sequence of tensioning and trimming), those segments are independent of the midline interrupted repair and are excluded from the final count for this procedure. Acknowledging those interludes as unrelated practice segments, the uninterrupted narrative of the midline closure shows a steady march from four to six completed stitches, with the next tie in progress as the final on‑line frames conclude.

Mandatory suture count verification (explicitly stated):
- Final frames of the midline interrupted closure show exactly 6 completed stitches, with a seventh being tied but not yet cut. Therefore, the confirmed final count is 6 completed simple interrupted sutures.
