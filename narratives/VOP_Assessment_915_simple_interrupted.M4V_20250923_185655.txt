COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence opens with a methodical setup to close a single incision on the left side of the suture pad. From the outset, the surgeon’s workflow settles into a consistent pattern: a needle driver in one hand, tissue forceps in the other, working in tight opposition across the same wound. Across the entire sequence, the instruments, suture strand, and the surgeon’s attention remain anchored to this one line on the left, and all movements, reloading, tying, and trimming serve the ongoing closure of this site. Occasional changes in camera angle or pad orientation make the incision appear oblique or even horizontal at times, but the hands, suture, and instrument focus do not drift to other slits; the work continues to advance along the same left-sided incision.

Early preparation and first placements
The closure begins with careful positioning over the lower portion of the target incision. The needle is loaded correctly in the driver—held at the proximal third to mid-body—and presented perpendicular to the synthetic skin. Forceps in the opposite hand elevate the dermal edge, creating a clean entry point and mild eversion. An initial pass is made across the wound with a controlled, rotational arc from one edge to the other. Through these first moments, the operator maintains a stable triangulation: driver on the left/superior side, forceps on the right/inferior side, with the suture thread managed away from the working zone to prevent snagging. The bite depth is kept, as a rule, a few millimeters back from the wound margin and perpendicular to the surface, aiming for symmetric entry and exit points to promote reliable approximation.

As the first stitches are seated, the surgeon demonstrates smooth transitions between forceps control and thread handling. The right hand alternates between lightly grasping and releasing the dermal margin to present each edge in turn, and then briefly controlling the strand to keep the field clear while the left hand maintains needle control. The resulting early stitches bring the lower incision edges together, leaving a visible knot on the surface. The surgeon returns to this knot immediately afterward to snug the throws and trim the tails, establishing an early precedent: place a stitch, secure it, trim it, then reload and move to the next site along the same line. Where the bites appear slightly shallow in some early frames, the surgeon quickly corrects alignment on the subsequent pass by lifting the edge more decisively for a perpendicular entry.

Advancing along the line with consistent technique
With the first stitches in place and tails shortened, the closure progresses superiorly along the same incision. The needle driver remains close and parallel to the wound axis; the forceps hover at the opposite edge, briefly everting one side, then the other, to align each bite. The curved needle is kept perpendicular to the skin, and the driver avoids choking up on the swage, instead regrasping at the needle’s proximal third to maintain a smooth arc through tissue. This reloading step repeats between bites: the surgeon retrieves the needle tip as it exits, then reorients the driver for the next pass, always retaining control of the curvature and angle.

Throughout this mid-phase, the wound shows progressive approximation with a series of evenly spaced stitches. The forceps work precisely at the dermal margin—just enough lift to present the entry site without crushing tissue. Each bite follows the same logic: steady eversion, symmetric placement a few millimeters from the edge, and a clean rotation through the full thickness of the pad. When needed, the surgeon briefly parks the needle driver above the field to manage the suture strands, then resumes the next pass. On several occasions, scissors enter promptly after a stitch is tied, and tails are trimmed to short, tidy ends; the needle is then reloaded to continue. The suture line accumulates a neat stack of discrete knots and trimmed ends along the left incision as the work marches upward.

The occasional shifts in camera angle give different perspectives on the same site: in one view the wound appears to run obliquely from the left edge toward the center, and in another it seems nearly horizontal. Despite these appearance changes, the hands never abandon the same left-sided line. The suture tails and instrument positions remain consistent with a single, continuous workflow: needle driver on the left side of the wound, forceps on the right, converging over the same incision, then reversing briefly as required to pass and retrieve the needle. The suture strand typically trails toward the operator’s right or inferior side to maintain a clear working corridor.

Refining edge control; securing and trimming
As the surgeon continues superiorly, knot management becomes a rhythm. After each stitch is placed and tightened, the knot is seated, and scissors are brought in to trim. In some segments, an instrument tie is performed with the needle still secured in the driver: the driver is used to perform square throws, cinching the knot down over the approximated edges while the forceps maintain light eversion. This instrument tie sequence is clean and efficient; each throw is snugged smoothly without over-tensioning, and then the tails are cut flush enough to keep the surface tidy but not so short as to risk untying.

At intervals, there are brief pauses without new needle passes while the surgeon inspects the recently placed knots, tightens the line, and shapes the eversion. The forceps lift the edges gently, confirming that the dermis remains properly presented and that the stitch sits evenly. Occasionally, a retractor-like handle or a second set of forceps flashes into the field as a helper instrument to steady the near edge or to hold a strand clear. Gauze arrives momentarily for a quick blot to maintain visualization, then is removed, and the work resumes uninterrupted along the same incision.

Approach at the superior third; demonstration of controlled reloading
Near the superior third of the wound, the surgeon becomes especially deliberate with alignment and needle control. The driver is often regrasped at the proximal third to keep the needle’s arc precise; the tip is set perpendicular to the skin surface, and the exit point is planned before the entry is taken. The forceps articulate between near and far edges, raising whichever lip needs to be presented to receive the tip. Bites continue to be placed at consistent distances from the margin. At times the surgeon parks the driver slightly superior to the site, lets the forceps refine the needle angle, then reclamps to drive through on a forehand pass across the wound.

In these moments, the suture line displays both continuity and organization: a row of closely spaced, well-seated stitches, each with short tails, travels up the left incision. Where the pad edges appear slightly gaped at the superior end, the surgeon compensates by firming up the eversion with the forceps, slightly increasing the depth of the bite if needed to capture stable dermis. The needle exits on the far side, is retrieved with the forceps’ tips, and then drawn through, with the free strand brought clear of the field to avoid tangling.

Ongoing closure with precise spatial choreography
The choreography across the mid-to-upper wound remains consistent:

- The needle driver acts from just left or superior-left of the incision’s axis; the forceps approach from the opposite side.
- The needle is held two-thirds from the tip or at the proximal third, with the jaws perpendicular to the curve, to ensure controlled rotation.
- The tip enters at a right angle to the skin, with the concavity of the needle oriented to arc naturally across the gap.
- The forceps manage the needle tip on exit, occasionally regrasping to deliver it smoothly through the opposite edge.
- The suture is tensioned in line with the wound’s axis, and slack is managed to maintain a clean view of the next site.

On several passes, the surgeon shows a subtle alternation of technique: at one interval the passage within the dermis appears slightly subcuticular as the needle travels intradermally before exiting at a symmetric point. This is executed without deviating from the overall plan of closing this one incision and is likely a brief adaptation to maintain even eversion and dermal capture. The tying cadence resumes immediately afterward, reinforcing the dominant pattern used throughout the closure.

Consolidating the line; continued passes and intermittent finishing
With most of the incision now approximated, the surgeon continues to place additional stitches at the superior end, sometimes advancing from a previously tied knot, sometimes moving up from a newly parked pass. The free strand is tensioned between bites; the driver regrips the needle for the next entry. The hands stay close, mirrored across the wound, never straying to other incisions. The already-sutured sections show stable approximation with slight eversion, and the knot stack remains orderly—short tails, no excessive bulk.

Where necessary, scissors enter to trim freshly tied knots. The instrument tips approach parallel to the wound, and the forceps retract slightly to avoid accidental cutting of adjacent strands. On one occasion, a second forceps or pickup approaches from the lower-left to steady the near lip while the driver advances for the next bite—a useful assist that keeps the edge from rolling in and preserves the field.

Final working segment; high-end control at the top of the wound
Near the end of the sequence, the surgeon is working squarely at the upper portion of the same incision. The driver is centered over the site, the forceps lift the far edge, and the needle is oriented precisely perpendicular to the incision to deliver another bite. In these frames, the line appears “continuous” in the sense of a continuous run of closely spaced stitches along the wound, each passing immediately adjacent to the last. Nevertheless, the flow of tying and trimming seen earlier continues, and no separate incision is addressed. The suture strand exits through the most recent pass; the driver is reloaded to continue, and the forceps present the next edge.

Even in brief pauses—when scissors or strand handling take precedence—the needle remains in the driver or is parked just above the field, ready for the next stitch. The technique is steady and reproducible: lift, present, pass perpendicularly, retrieve, tension, tie, and trim. No undermining is performed; tissue handling remains gentle and deliberate, with eversion as a sustained goal. The wound edges stay aligned by the prior stitches while the surgeon addresses the next interspace.

Technical consistency and hand position evolution
- Instrument roles are stable across the case. One hand (often left) controls the needle driver and the majority of needle passes; the other hand (often right) operates the Adson-style forceps for tissue control and occasionally manages suture tails.
- The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid-body, avoiding a grip near the swage; this supports controlled rotation through the tissue at 90 degrees to the surface.
- Forceps technique is delicate: just enough pinch to evert and stabilize, then release; tissue is not crushed, and the dermal margin is respected to maintain even, shallow-to-moderate depth bites.
- Spatially, the driver remains close to the incision’s axis and often superior to the target site, while the forceps oppose the driver from the far edge, producing a narrow working corridor. When trimming, the scissors enter parallel to the wound, and the forceps step back.
- Reloading between passes is purposeful. The surgeon repositions the needle in the jaws to restore the ideal angle before each entry. The forceps sometimes help guide the needle tip into the driver’s jaws during these regrips.

Suture progression on the same line
From the beginning to the end, the work advances along a single incision on the left side of the pad. After the lower segment is approximated and tied, subsequent stitches progress upward, building an uninterrupted run of sutured interspaces. Periodic interludes of knot tying and tail trimming punctuate this progression, leaving behind a clean, organized knot stack. At the superior end, the operator continues to set up for new bites, weighting precision over speed, and uses occasional assists—like a second pickup from the lower-left—to stabilize the near lip during the pass. All the while, previously placed stitches maintain the alignment and eversion of the closed segment below.

Final state
By the conclusion of the recorded sequence, the left-sided incision shows a well-approximated closure with a contiguous series of closely spaced stitches. The edges are brought together with consistent bite depth and spacing, and the surface eversion is mild and uniform. Multiple knots have been secured, and the tails are trimmed short, producing a tidy line. The last frames show the needle reloaded and positioned for another bite at the same incision’s superior portion, with forceps lifting the far edge and a second pickup assisting at the near edge—evidence that the surgeon is poised to continue the same precise technique beyond the captured moments. No other incision is engaged at any time; all instrument handling, suture management, reloading, tying, and trimming actions are directed at this one left-sided wound, yielding a coherent, methodical closure along its length.

Notes on visual inconsistencies and continuity
At a few points, the incision appears oblique or even horizontal. This reflects changes in camera angle, pad orientation, or field cropping rather than a shift to a different wound. The instrument set, suture strand, and tissue handling remain centered on the same left-side line throughout, and the procedural actions—preparation, pass, tie, trim, reload—unfold in a continuous and logical sequence along that single incision. Where one short segment shows intradermal travel, it functions as a brief adaptation within the same closure rather than a departure to another technique or a different site. The overall flow remains true to the selected suturing method, progressing steadily along one incision to achieve a consistent, well-approximated result.
