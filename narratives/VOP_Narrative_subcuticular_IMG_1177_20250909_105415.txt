COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire sequence focuses on closing a single, short vertical laceration down the middle of a three‑slit silicone suture pad. The two longer, parallel slits on either side are never manipulated; all activity is confined to the central vertical wound. Over the course of the procedure the operator places and secures simple interrupted sutures, beginning with exploratory passes and setup at the lower and central portions, then definitively securing a first stitch in the midline and, later, adding a second stitch inferior to it. By the end, two completed interrupted sutures are visible along this one midline wound.

The work begins at the inferior third of the central slit. The left hand holds Adson-type forceps at the left wound lip, lifting and everting the edge to present a firm, perpendicular target. The right hand holds a needle driver, gripping the curved needle about two‑thirds from its tip and orienting it perpendicular to the pad surface for a forehand drive. The first outside‑in bite is initiated on the right wound edge at the lower end of the incision. At this earliest point there is no approximation yet—this is a setup pass to establish the bite geometry while the left hand provides counter‑traction and spacing at the edge.

Almost immediately afterward, attention shifts from the very inferior portion to the center of the laceration. With the left forceps still maintaining eversion on the left lip just off the midline, the right hand brings the driver across and passes the needle through the tissue. The bite traverses the dermal layer of the left and then the right wound edges across the midline, and the right hand regrips the long strand to begin instrument tying. The left hand transitions from forceps to the short tail, holding it steady while the right hand wraps the suture around the jaws of the driver to form the first throw. These are early tying maneuvers; no knot is yet locked, and the wound edges remain only loosely approximated.

The surgeon then re-engages at the lower third. With the driver poised just inferior and to the right of the wound, the curved needle is swept in an arc across the gap. The left hand alternates between controlling the suture strand and using the fingertips to steady the near (left) wound edge, substituting for forceps during this brief interval. The bite is drawn through, but still no knot is placed at this location. At the mid‑to‑lower third, the left forceps return to evert the left margin while the right hand takes a precise bite through the right edge and drives the needle across the incision toward the left. The thread begins to span the gap, guided by the natural curve of the needle with a wrist rotation. Again, these are placement maneuvers—no knot is yet tied at the lower third.

Continuing at the lower portion, the left hand remains on the left lip with forceps, and the right hand advances the needle from right to left across the lower third of the slit. At times a second instrument steadies the suture on the right for control. The pass is completed and the filament is drawn through, but the stitch is not secured within these frames. At this stage, several passes have been made at the inferior and central portions, building the foundation for definitive knotting later.

Attention then returns to the middle of the wound for the first attempt at tying. A single stitch that spans the center of the slit is present and the operator begins instrument ties. The left hand stabilizes the left wound edge with forceps, keeping the tissue everted while the right hand uses the needle holder to grasp the free tail and execute throws over the looped long strand. The throws are seated down toward the dermal plane, but by the end of this sequence the knot is not yet fully locked; the edges are beginning to come together but there is still no completed knot.

The needle is reloaded and another pass is made across the midline. The left forceps continue to pick up the dermal edge to maintain eversion, and the right needle driver advances the needle perpendicular to the edge, then repositions it for the next bite. Thread lies across the center of the gap but no knot is secured in this particular run. These sequences show the operator refining entry/exit points at the central portion to achieve optimal edge eversion and symmetric bites.

Shortly thereafter, a milestone is reached: one simple interrupted stitch is now tied at the midportion of the central slit. The knot sits over the center of the wound with the tails drawn superiorly and laid aside to maintain a clear field. With that first stitch present, the team reloads the needle to prepare for the next placement inferior to the first, although that passage is not yet executed by the end of that segment.

The midline stitch is then seated and confirmed. With the left forceps gently lifting and everting the left edge, the right hand pulls the long end upward to snug the knot down centrally. The knot is square and secure, and the edges are approximated with slight eversion beneath it. Immediately after, the needle is reloaded again and brought near the superior part of the same incision as if to start another stitch; penetration is not completed in these frames. At this juncture, there is exactly one completed knot centered along the wound.

The next series of frames builds on this: the left hand, positioned inferior‑left of the field, continues to stabilize tissue with forceps, while the right hand completes instrument ties over the center stitch to ensure its security. The scissors, visible off to the right, are not used yet. By the end of this portion, the central simple interrupted suture is clearly completed and visible at the midpoint.

With that midline stitch secured, the operator starts planning the spacing for the next stitch. The left hand moves up to the superior half of the incision margin with forceps, and the right hand positions the needle driver to take a bite on the right superior wound edge for a right‑to‑left pass. The earlier central knot is finished and protected; this new bite is merely initiated and not tied, and no second stitch is completed during this sequence. The suture count remains one.

Rather than committing to a new stitch immediately, the operator returns to the existing suture to finish and reinforce the knot. The needle that had been held in the driver is released; the driver is now used purely as an instrument to hold and pull the suture while forming additional throws. The left forceps stabilize and evert the left wound margin as the right hand alternates tension between the free and standing ends to seat each throw. These moves tighten and secure the central knot further without adding a new stitch, keeping the suture count at one.

The focus on knot security continues. The right hand briefly holds the needle driver and the strand, then sets the driver down on the field to the upper right so both hands can perform hand ties more precisely. The curved needle remains attached to the free end but does not engage tissue; the left hand controls near the swage to prevent tangling as the throws are formed. The throws are lowered smoothly to the center of the slit, cinching the edges together at the stitch site. No new needle passes occur during these frames, and by the end of this run there is still a single completed interrupted suture over the center of the wound.

Tying then proceeds with the hands alone at what is described as the upper‑middle portion of the incision. The left hand, lateral and left of the pad, maintains steady counter‑tension on the standing end. The right hand hovers over the incision, manipulating the free end to form additional loops and to cinch them down. The needle driver is at rest on the field above and to the right, not in use. No forceps grasp tissue at this moment; instead, the suture tails are tensioned in opposite directions—left hand pulling inferior‑left, right hand pulling superior‑right—to seat the knot precisely over the original entry/exit points. After tightening, there remains exactly one completed interrupted stitch.

Only then does the operator return to add another stitch along the wound. The left hand uses gloved fingertips to control the suture tail at the superior‑central region as the right hand resumes control of the needle driver. Grasping the needle at its proximal third and orienting it perpendicular to the skin, the right hand drives the needle cleanly across the midline wound to place a new interrupted stitch inferior to the existing one. The needle is regrasped to complete the pull‑through, and the edges at this lower location are approximated by traction on the strand without forceps. The right hand executes the knot—using the driver initially and then hand‑over‑hand tensioning as needed—while the left hand maintains counter‑tension on the short end. Once the knot is seated firmly, the right hand switches to scissors and trims the excess suture tails. At the end of the sequence, two completed interrupted sutures are visible on this single midline wound: the original stitch centered in the upper‑middle portion and a second stitch placed inferior to it.

Throughout the procedure, the technique is consistent and careful. The needle is almost always grasped on the body about two‑thirds from the tip, presented perpendicular to the skin surface, and advanced with a smooth wrist rotation that follows the curve, achieving symmetric, perpendicular bites through the dermal layer. The left hand’s forceps are used to evert the wound edges to ensure full‑thickness approximation and slight eversion under each knot. When tying, the operator alternates between instrument ties—wrapping the long end around the needle holder, grasping the short tail, and pulling through—and hand ties, depending on access and control. Tension is applied in opposing vectors across the incision (left hand infero‑left versus right hand supero‑right) to seat knots squarely without shearing the tissue. Spatially, the hands oppose each other across the vertical slit, with the right hand generally working to the right of the wound and crossing over during passes or throws, and the left hand stationed just left of the incision to stabilize tissue or manage the standing end. Instruments are set down deliberately when not needed: the needle driver rests off to the right during hand ties, and the scissors remain idle until final trimming of the second stitch.

The sequence of stitch placement follows a logical pattern that reflects both learning moments and deliberate planning. Early passes explore both the inferior and central regions to establish proper bite depth and orientation. The first truly secured suture is ultimately centered along the incision, where it brings the edges together reliably. The operator then spends several intervals reinforcing that knot with additional throws to ensure its integrity. Only after the central stitch is definitively stable does the operator place and secure a second stitch below it, trimming the ends to conclude the work seen in the frames.

Suture count and progression:
- Beginning through the early middle of the video, multiple needle passes are made at the lower third and center, and early tying is attempted, but no knots are yet fully secured. The count remains at 0.
- By the point where the mid‑portion knot is seated and confirmed, there is 1 completed interrupted suture visible in the center/upper‑middle of the wound. Subsequent sequences concentrate on adding and locking additional throws to this same stitch without increasing the count.
- In the final segment, a new interrupted stitch is placed inferior to the first, tied securely, and the tails are cut, increasing the count to 2.

Final state and mandatory suture count verification:
- The procedure results in 2 completed simple interrupted sutures along the single central vertical wound.
- The first completed stitch lies at the center/upper‑middle of the incision and is well seated with multiple throws; the edges are neatly approximated under it.
- The second stitch is positioned inferior to the first along the same midline; it has been tied and trimmed.
- The suture count increases from 0 early on, to 1 once the central stitch is secured, and finally to 2 after placement and tying of the inferior stitch in the last frames.

In summary, the surgeon methodically closes the central vertical laceration with simple interrupted technique: establishing proper bite geometry with forceps‑assisted eversion, consistently driving the needle perpendicular across the gap, performing instrument and hand ties to secure square knots, and applying balanced tension to approximate the edges without trauma. The lateral slits remain untouched. By the end of the recorded sequence, exactly two completed interrupted sutures are present on the central wound, with good approximation and slight eversion at each stitch.
