COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The closure unfolds on a single site from beginning to end: the short vertical incision at the far-left edge of the suture pad. From the first frames through the last, the hands, instruments, and suture line repeatedly return to and advance along this same left-sided wound, building a single continuous line of closure from its inferior end toward its superior end. Other incisions are occasionally visible, including a centrally located midline with old knots, but those are not part of the active work of this sequence. Even where a brief segment shows activity over the midline incision, there is no continuation of that work; the only line that progresses from first bite to trimming is the far-left vertical wound.

The sequence opens with preparation for the first passes on the left incision. The wound is gaping, pale subdermal layer visible across a length of roughly 3–4 cm, and there are no prior sutures on this line. The operator adopts a consistent instrument pairing and stance: the left hand holds the needle driver, the right hand holds Adson forceps. The needle is loaded in the jaws at roughly the proximal third to mid-portion of the curve, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface, ready to deliver precise, dermal-level bites. The right-hand forceps’ role is immediately clear: they lift and evert the wound edge to present a robust dermal shelf, stabilize the tissue, and protect the edge from crush while allowing the needle to come through at a controlled depth and distance from the cut.

Early passes begin low on the wound. The driver positions lateral to the left margin and the forceps medial, so the hands oppose each other across the incision. The needle is advanced in a smooth arc, entering the dermis a few millimeters from the edge. The near-to-far trajectory is consistent with a subcuticular approach: the needle travels through the dermis, emerging into the wound and then crossing to a corresponding depth in the opposite dermal edge. The suture is drawn through and managed in broad loops to keep the field clear. During these first frames, no knot tying is attempted; instead, the operator focuses on building the run. The tissue behavior reflects the intention: gentle eversion, symmetric depth, and no undue tension—hallmarks of preparing and seating a running subcuticular line.

Momentum builds as the closure proceeds up the incision. The operator stays faithful to a predictable choreography. The left hand, with the driver, remains lateral to the wound for entry, then crosses toward the right as the needle arcs. The right hand provides counter-traction and eversion on whichever edge the needle is about to enter or exit. The suture is pulled through after each pass, and slack is laid off superiorly or laterally in wide loops to minimize entanglement. Each subsequent bite is placed a consistent distance from the cut edge and at a matching depth, producing a repeatable, ladder-like series of dermal engagements beneath the epidermis. Throughout these mid-sequence frames, the wound edges begin to coapt smoothly, and mild, uniform puckering appears—exactly what one expects as the subcuticular line tensions the superficial dermis, drawing the edges together without leaving exposed external knots.

Counting the line’s progress: at first there are no visible stitches on this wound. After the early passes at the inferior end, one clearly formed segment of the run is present, with the wound edges approximated at the lower third. The operator continues superiorly. The next set of frames shows the needle again grasped at the proximal third, poised perpendicular to the skin, and the forceps presenting the edge. The suture is drawn through; the visible effect is the addition of another well-seated segment of the running line. By the time the work reaches the upper half of the wound, there are two clearly visible segments of closure. The middle portion of the sequence reinforces the same technique: the driver remains lateral relative to the current bite, the forceps medial; the needle is reloaded consistently on the curve; the arc is short and controlled to limit tissue trauma; exit points mirror entry points in depth and spacing.

As the operator advances, a pattern emerges in the images that helps quantify the run without mistaking it for an interrupted series. Each “completed stitch” referenced in the mid-sequence descriptions corresponds to one more segment of the continuous line seated and tensioned. After adding a third segment, then a fourth, the run displays a tidy, evenly spaced series of dermal bites. The wound edges below the working area remain coapted with slight, symmetric rippling. Instrument posture is still sound: the left hand with the needle driver holds the curve at the proximal third, perpendicular to the skin; the right hand’s Adsons gently pinch the dermis rather than the epidermal edge to avoid crush, and the tissue is everted a few millimeters for each pass.

Approaching the apex, a fifth segment is added below the area where the instruments are poised to finish. At this point the wound line below the working zone shows five well-placed bites holding the edges together. While several earlier descriptions use the language of “completed stitches,” the closure remains one continuous subcuticular line—there are no discrete knots between bites, no individual simple interrupted throws that would divide the line into separate sutures. The uninterrupted character becomes explicit as the operator transitions to the termination phase at the superior end.

The finishing sequence at the top of the wound shows a shift in intent from passage to securing. The needle is still held in the driver at the proximal third, but rather than taking additional tissue bites, it is used to manage loops to secure the running line. The right hand still assists near the apex, sometimes with forceps and sometimes with a second driver or fingers, to manage loops and tension for the terminal tie. The suture material is manipulated above the skin surface: a loop is formed, looped around the instrument, and tightened down in an instrument-tie fashion to lock the run. This is characteristic of closing a running subcuticular: once the dermal bites have reached the planned endpoint, the operator creates a terminal knot or lock at the apex to secure the line without burying excess material. The wound edges are already approximated along the length; the last movements at the top organize the suture into a compact, stable finish.

There is a brief interlude in one segment in which the camera or hands appear to address the central midline incision. That midline bears preexisting interrupted knots and, in the brief sequence shown, a new bite on that line is initiated but not completed. Crucially, that interlude does not continue to completion and does not alter or advance any other line. Both before and after that side excursion, the work returns to the far-left vertical wound, and it is on that left wound that the continuous subcuticular line is definitively secured and trimmed. As such, the only suture line that starts, progresses, and finishes within this sequence is the left vertical incision.

The last frames confirm the nature and finality of the closure. The superior end of the left incision shows the suture strand emerging, with scissors (or a driver used as cutters) brought to the field by the left hand to trim the terminal loop. No needle is visible—appropriate for a finishing step—and no new tissue bite is being taken. The wound edges beneath display evenly spaced dermal engagements with mild, uniform puckering; there are no discrete external knots along the line, only a single terminal loop at the apex where the closure is secured. The right hand hovers above and to the right, assisting with strand control but not grasping tissue. The overall picture is of a completed continuous subcuticular closure being finished with a terminal trim.

Technique and hand position remained remarkably consistent across the sequence:
- The needle driver stayed in the left hand, holding the curved needle at the proximal third to middle, with the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin for controlled, low-profile passes.
- The right hand used Adson forceps for gentle eversion and presentation of the dermis at each edge, alternating sides as the needle advanced through near and far edges in matched fashion.
- Spatially, the driver worked lateral to the current bite and crossed toward the medial side along the needle’s arc; the forceps opposed it across the wound, maintaining tissue stability and eversion.
- Suture management favored wide loops placed away from the wound line during the run to avoid tangles and preserve visibility, then transitioned to loop handling and instrument ties at the apex.
- Tissue handling was careful and symmetric, with bites taken a few millimeters from the epidermal margin, yielding precise edge alignment and modest, uniform puckering consistent with a subcuticular line rather than raised “dog ears” or asymmetric inversion/eversion.

Progress and counting across time can be summarized as follows:
- Initiation (inferior end): No stitches are yet present on the left incision; the first dermal bite is planned and taken while the opposite edge is everted with forceps. The suture is drawn through without tying.
- Early progression: The first visible segment of the running line appears at the lower third after the initial passes; the wound edges begin to approximate locally. Hand positions remain driver-lateral, forceps-medial.
- Building the run mid-wound: A second and third segment are added in sequence, each time reproducing the same entry/exit spacing and depth; the continuous nature of the line is maintained with no intervening knots.
- Advancing toward the apex: A fourth, then a fifth segment is seated below the working area. The closure displays a continuous, evenly spaced series of dermal bites with mild, uniform puckering and stable coaptation.
- Termination at the superior end: No new bites are taken. Instead, loops are formed and instrument ties performed at the top to lock the running line. The final step is trimming the terminal loop with scissors at the apex.

Mandatory suture count verification:
1) Final visible count in the last frames: The left incision displays a completed continuous subcuticular closure with one terminal loop/knot at the superior end. There are 0 discrete interrupted sutures on this line at case end. Beneath the apex, five evenly spaced dermal bites are visible along the run prior to the terminal tie in the immediately preceding finishing frames, and no new bites are added during the tying and trimming steps.
2) Explicit statement: The procedure resulted in one completed continuous subcuticular suture comprising five dermal bites, secured with a single terminal knot/loop. Therefore, the number of discrete interrupted sutures visible on this line at the end is 0.
3) Final state description: At the conclusion, the left vertical incision is fully approximated by a single continuous subcuticular line. The edges are coapted with mild, uniform puckering consistent with dermal engagement. The only surface feature at the top is the terminal loop being trimmed. No free needles remain in the field and no additional tissue passes are being made.
4) Progression tracking: The sequence builds from 0 segments to at least five dermal bites along the run by the time the operator transitions to tying; the count does not increase after the tying begins, because no further tissue passes are performed—only locking and trimming.

In terms of spatial relationships and ergonomics over time, the operator maintains a stable configuration around the left wound. The needle driver consistently approaches from the lateral side of the current bite and is angled slightly medially as it drives the needle through the dermis. The right hand’s forceps are positioned on the medial side for near-edge eversion, then switch to the lateral edge when the arc requires a contralateral bite; this mirrored alternation ensures each pass is symmetric. In the termination phase, both instruments come together at the apex to manage loops; the right hand occasionally exchanges the forceps for a second driver or simply provides fingertip control to help lay the loops flat, while the left hand uses the primary driver to tension and seat the throws. In the very last step, the left hand brings scissors adjacent to the exiting strand at the superior end, aligning them parallel with the suture for a clean, flush trim of the terminal loop; the right hand hovers superior-right, guarding the field but not manipulating tissue.

Throughout, the technique remains consistent with a continuous subcuticular approach. Passes are subdermal-to-subdermal with epidermis largely spared; bites are equidistant from the cut edge; slack is controlled; and the only knotting occurs at the end (with possible anchoring low or within the dermis not visible here), culminating in a single terminal loop at the apex. Any references in intermediate frames to “completed stitches” are best understood as completed segments of the continuous line visible at the surface rather than separate, fully tied, simple interrupted sutures. The absence of individual knots along the length and the final trimming of a single terminal loop confirm this interpretation.

Final summary:
- Site: Left vertical incision throughout.
- Approach: Continuous subcuticular closure executed from the inferior end to the superior end, using instrument-assisted dermal bites with forceps for eversion.
- Progression: The line advances in evenly spaced dermal bites—one, then two, then three, reaching five visible segments below the apex just before termination—without discrete knots between bites.
- Termination: Instrument ties at the superior end secure the continuous run; scissors trim the terminal loop.
- Verification—final count: The completed line contains 0 discrete interrupted sutures. It consists of one continuous subcuticular suture comprising five dermal bites, secured with a single terminal knot/loop at the superior end.
- Final wound state: Edges are accurately approximated with mild, uniform puckering, no active retraction required, no needle in the field, and the suture tail neatly trimmed—closure complete.
