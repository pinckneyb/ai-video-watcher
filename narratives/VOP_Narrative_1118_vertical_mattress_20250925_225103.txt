COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator attending to the small, superficial horizontal incision located in the upper third of the practice pad — the short transverse wound just above the larger, centrally sutured incision. From the first frames the field is tightly focused on that superior incision: both gloved hands are positioned immediately adjacent to the wound and instruments straddle the incision in a coordinated pincer configuration. A curved, swaged needle mounted on a fine suture is repeatedly grasped in the needle driver (most often in the operator’s right hand) and advanced through shallow dermal bites while the opposing hand uses Adson-type or toothed forceps to present and stabilize the skin edge. The needle is habitually held near mid‑shaft or just posterior to mid‑shaft to allow controlled rotation through the tissue arc; its curve is oriented to carry the tip from one wound edge to the other in a smooth, controlled passage. Each bite is small, shallow and epidermally focused on the synthetic skin surrogate, with the forceps slightly everting the near edge so that epidermal apposition will be achieved when the stitch is seated.

In the opening sequence the technique is deliberate and methodical. Hands remain close together — generally within a few centimeters — and move in complementary vectors: the needle driver approaches from the lateral/upper‑right quadrant of the pad, the forceps from the medial/left or lower quadrant. The operator rotates the needle through the tissue in a standard arc, delivering bites that cross the wound perpendicularly or slightly obliquely depending on the local geometry. After each passage the suture tail is pulled through and controlled by the free hand, prepared for knot tying. Early passes show the needle tip emerging with a long tail, indicating full passage through both leaflets and readiness to seat a knot.

Throughout the middle portion of the recording the same superior incision is serially reapproximated. The operator adds stitches progressively along the short wound, working from the central or medial portion and extending laterally in successive placements. The hands maintain a close working relationship: the needle driver rotates and advances the needle in a downward arc from the operator’s right to left while the opposing instrument lifts, everts and steadies the tissue. When the needle exits, the free limb is tensioned and routinely exchanged between needle driver and forceps as required for knot-tying or trimming. The needle is recurrently grasped mid‑body in the jaws of the driver — a grasp that optimizes control of the curvature during rotation and limits undue stress on the synthetic tissue. Bites are consistently shallow dermal bites on the simulator, bringing epidermal edges into apposition without deep tissue retrieval or wide undermining; this produces a clean, slightly everted closure appropriate to skin approximation.

As the sequence continues, subtle changes in hand choreography are visible while the overall approach remains constant. At times the left and right hands reverse minor roles: in several frames the left instrument functions as the needle driver (grasping the needle and advancing it laterally) while the right hand steadies tissue with forceps. Nevertheless, the dominant pattern remains the same — a two‑instrument technique in which one instrument feeds and controls the needle while the other opposes, presents, and controls the suture tails. Instruments commonly cross over the incision plane during needle passage, and fingers or thumb pressure are occasionally used to stabilize the suture tails prior to knot formation. Toward the mid‑procedure the operator intermittently uses scissors or a small clamp to trim suture tails after tying, and in other moments the free hand momentarily holds and tensions the tails with a thumb rather than an instrument, reflecting routine adjustments and tactile control.

The suturing sequence shows a steady progression from needle passage to knotting and tail management at each placement. After the needle traverses both edges, the operator pulls the suture through, seats the bite, tensions the limb with the opposing forceps or fingers, and prepares the knot. Knot‑tying and seating are performed in close proximity to the wound with instruments crossing only slightly to prevent snagging the adjacent stitches. After securing a knot the operator usually trims the excess suture close to the knot, leaving a short tail; at times the tail is laid out and held while the next needle pass is prepared. By mid‑recording the central portion of the superior incision is approximated and a string of adjacent stitches has been placed; attention shifts to extending the row laterally to close the remaining open segment.

Throughout the procedure the operator consistently aims for slight eversion of the epidermal edges to optimize healing and reduce inversion-related gapping. Forceps are used atraumatically to evert and present the near edge as the needle is driven through the opposing side. Bites remain uniformly superficial; there is no evidence of deep fascial bites or subcutaneous layering — the work is focused on epidermal and superficial dermal approximation consistent with skin-only closure on a silicone model.

There is one episode during the sequence where the suture handling appears different: at a point when attention is focused along the right margin of the pad, the suture strand is advanced in a serial fashion down a vertical course and the needle passes appear to be part of a continuous progression along the right side. This brief appearance of a continuous or running pattern contrasts with the dominant pattern of placing discrete, interrupted stitches along the superior wound. It likely reflects either transient management of suture slack or a local maneuver to advance suture along an adjacent margin, but it stands out as an anomaly against the prevailing interrupted technique used to reapproximate the superior incision. Despite this discrepancy, the operator soon returns to placing individual interrupted bites and tying knots sequentially along the top wound, reinforcing the interrupted approach as the procedural mainstay.

As closure continues, the operator refines spatial relationships and hand positioning to finish the row. Hands become slightly more compact around the working zone as successive knots and tails accumulate medially; the free hand alternates between traction on the most recent knot and presentation of the next bite. At times one hand temporarily releases tension to permit trimming while the other continues to maintain wound edge apposition. The needle driver remains the primary instrument for needle control and is used with a predictable mid‑shaft grasp that allows the operator to control the arc and avoid catching previously placed knots. The opposing forceps consistently provides counter‑traction, edge eversion, and suture management. Instrument tips stay near the skin surface to minimize lever arm and improve tactile control.

Toward the later stages the operator focuses on completing lateral bites adjacent to earlier knots and finalizing each stitch by seating the knot and trimming tails. The sequence includes several frames where the needle has already been passed and the performer is tensioning the suture limb or using scissors to cut the tail — clear finishing gestures that close individual stitches and tidy the line. The hands maintain a steady, economical motion: the needle driver delivers and withdraws the needle, the forceps receives and steadies both tissue and the suture limb, and the free hand occasionally manipulates the tail by thumb to position it for cutting.

Spatially, the entire operation remains localized: instruments hover within a narrow corridor above the superior wound; the needle driver is typically lateral/superior to the incision as it advances needle tips medially, while the forceps take up a medial/inferior approach to receive and present tissue. This relative geometry facilitates smooth cross‑incision needle arcs. Hands occasionally cross slightly above the wound plane as the needle traverses from one side to the other, but the operator keeps movements compact to avoid disrupting previously placed stitches. Throughout, the operator demonstrates consistent instrument orientation and coordinated bilateral control.

By the final recordings the superior incision is fully approximated along its length. The wound edges lie in close apposition with a subtle, even eversion produced by the tensioning of the interrupted stitches. Previously visible gaps are closed, and the suture tails have been managed — many have been tensioned and trimmed close to the knots. The surface of the synthetic skin shows minimal puckering and no gross distortion; completed stitches hold the epidermal margins in a neat line that aligns with the central, already-closed midline wound. Final gestures include last‑minute tension adjustments, cutting of the remaining tails, and a last sweep with forceps to confirm uniform approximation along the row.

Overall, the procedure demonstrates a repeated, controlled application of discrete interrupted sutures placed along the superior transverse incision. The operator consistently uses a paired‑instrument technique — a needle driver to control and rotate a mid‑shaft grasped curved needle and opposing forceps to present and evert the tissue and to manage suture limbs. Bites are shallow and dermally focused, knotting and trimming are performed immediately after each pass, and the spatial choreography of the hands remains compact and coordinated across the entire case. A brief, isolated interval shows a continuous‑appearing advancement along a right margin, a minor divergence from the otherwise uniform interrupted approach; regardless, the clinician returns to the sequential placement and securing of individual stitches until the incision is uniformly and neatly closed, with even edge apposition and tidy, cut tails at the conclusion of the session.
