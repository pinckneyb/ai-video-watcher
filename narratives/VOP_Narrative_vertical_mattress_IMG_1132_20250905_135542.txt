COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a three‑incision suture pad with the operator working primarily on the small central wound. The rhythm is deliberate and economical: right hand on a gold‑handled needle driver, left hand with Adson forceps. From the start (0–14 s), the right hand loads the curved needle at the proximal/mid body and approaches from the patient’s right. With the left forceps everting the opposite edge, the needle is set perpendicular to the skin and driven along its curve through the right lip of the central incision. The driver briefly releases and regrips closer to the needle tip to complete the arc.

Through 15–29 s, the pass continues near‑to‑far across the wound. The left forceps stay just off the edge to provide counter‑traction while the right hand follows the curve and draws the suture through, leaving a short tail on the near (entry) side. The needle is then reloaded for the counterbite.

Between 30–44 s, the contralateral bite is taken: the driver holds the needle at the proximal‑to‑mid third and enters the left edge orthogonally, passing external to internal to complete the simple interrupted path. The left forceps stabilize the dermis without crushing while the suture is pulled through, laying a loop neatly across the incision. No knot yet—just a clean traverse on both sides.

In the next sequence (45–59 s), the right hand secures the needle and draws remaining slack through the prior exit, then reloads, orienting the curve perpendicular to the wound for the next move. The forceps briefly leave, then return to evert the right edge as the needle is aligned for another bite. By 60–74 s, the pace shifts to suture management and reloading. The left hand alternates from instrument use to fingers to straighten the long limb, presents the needle, and the right driver takes it at the proximal‑mid body, setting up for a right‑edge entry. The suture is kept taut and swept off the field.

At 75–89 s, the needle is parked safely on the pad while an instrument tie is performed on the central stitch. The right driver alternately grasps the suture strand and, briefly, the needle near the swage to reposition; the left hand maintains the long limb outside the wound. The throws are laid with opposing tensions to square the knot, which seats centrally over the puncture sites.

With the knot down, 90–104 s shows the right hand bringing in scissors to trim the tails while the left hand stabilizes with the driver. After cutting, both hands clear, then return: the right hand now reloaded with the needle, the left with forceps poised over the next target area.

The next stitch begins at the inferior portion of the central incision (105–119 s). The needle is loaded at the distal/mid third and aimed perpendicular to the skin. The left forceps grasp the near dermal edge for eversion as the right hand penetrates the left lip, releases and regrips to complete the passage, then pulls suture through. The needle is reloaded for the opposite edge.

A brief transition follows (120–134 s): the needle is withdrawn following its curve, the left forceps take the needle near the swage to clear slack laterally, and the right driver reloads it at the middle‑to‑proximal third, aligning the tip for a perpendicular entry—now positioned near the left‑sided incision, suggesting a planned move to that wound after completing the current stitch.

Before that move, however, the surgeon ties the stitch just placed (135–149 s). The needle is parked out of the immediate field while the right hand performs an instrument tie on the central incision. The left forceps hold near the exit to maintain control; throws are formed and advanced parallel to the incision, the knot seated precisely over the bite without crushing tissue.

The sequence continues (150–164 s) with additional throws to secure the knot. The long limb is tensioned diagonally across the field to preserve working space while the right driver alternates wrap and grasp maneuvers to square each throw. With the knot secure, the left hand lifts the curved needle and presents it; the right driver takes it about two‑thirds from the tip, reorienting it perpendicular for the next pass.

At 165–179 s, the surgeon executes another simple interrupted on the central short incision. The left forceps evert the edge; the right driver passes the needle perpendicular to the skin, following the curve through to the opposite side. The suture is tightened, a knot is formed and secured, and scissors enter briefly from the right to trim tails close to the knot—efficient pass‑tie‑cut.

The flow maintains its cadence as a new pass begins (180–194 s). Working from the patient’s right, the needle is held at the proximal third and set perpendicular for entry into the right lip of the central wound. After partial passage, the left forceps catch the needle tip, allowing the right hand to regrip closer to the tip to complete the arc. The suture is drawn through and swept superiorly/rightward to clear the field.

Between 195–209 s, the driver, now superior‑right, completes a right‑to‑left pass across the central incision while the left forceps briefly evert and stabilize the near edge. After pull‑through, the needle is reloaded tip‑forward for the opposite bite; no knot is tied yet.

The next interval (210–224 s) shows repeated precise regrasping at the junction of the proximal and distal thirds of the needle, each time reorienting perpendicular to the skin. The left forceps maintain gentle eversion of the near edge; the suture is pulled through and slack removed, laying a strand across the incision while preparing for the next bite.

During 225–239 s, the right hand continues to adjust the needle near the swage to set the curvature for the next insertion, while the left hand temporarily releases the forceps and uses fingers to traction the suture, clearing the workspace. The needle is finally positioned at the near edge of the right‑sided vertical incision, indicating a planned move to that lateral wound.

The sequence closes (240–251 s) with another knot‑tying vignette on a midline stitch already placed. The needle itself remains out of play while the right driver wraps the standing strand, grasps the short tail, and draws it through in successive instrument‑tie throws. The left hand assists briefly with forceps or a second instrument to help set tension. The throws are alternated to square the knot, which is seated down evenly on the tissue. Instruments then withdraw, leaving a cleanly approximated wound with neatly trimmed knots and a clear field.

Across the entire session, the hand choreography evolves smoothly: early, the left hand relies on forceps for controlled eversion during every pass; mid‑sequence, it alternates between forceps and fingers for suture management and needle hand‑offs; during ties, the left consistently manages the long limb while the right driver executes wraps and retrieves the short tail. The right hand’s needle handling remains consistent—grasping at the proximal‑to‑mid third, keeping the needle perpendicular, following the curve, and regripping closer to the tip as needed. The overall rhythm is a repeated, efficient cycle—present, pass, pull‑through, park, tie, cut—punctuated by brief reloads and field‑clearing movements, progressing from the central incision to adjacent sites while maintaining meticulous suture control and knot placement.
