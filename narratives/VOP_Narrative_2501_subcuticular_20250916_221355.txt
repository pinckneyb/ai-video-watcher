Field and setup
The procedure is performed on a silicone skin pad with three parallel vertical incisions: a short left nick, a longer central slit, and a vertical wound at the far right edge. Throughout, the operator uses a simple interrupted technique with consistent fundamentals: the needle is loaded at the proximal third-to-mid body, held perpendicular to the skin, driven with a controlled wrist‑arc through the dermis, and each stitch is tied before moving proximally to the next. Forceps are used to stabilize and evert the edge being pierced, ensuring symmetric, dermal‑level bites a few millimeters from the margin. The right‑side incision is the ongoing line of closure the operator returns to again and again, advancing toward its superior end with instrument ties and periodic trimming of tails. At a few moments, separate demonstrations occur on the central incision; those off‑line passes are not part of the ongoing right‑side closure and are noted as such when they appear.

Initial passes and early count on the right wound
After brief setup and tensioning, the first sustained activity on the right‑edge incision appears with four completed simple interrupted stitches already present and evenly spaced along its lower/mid segment. In the 15.0–29.0 s interval, the dominant hand (most often the right) controls a needle driver above and to the right of this wound, drawing suture through and regripping the needle for the next pass while the assistant hand manages the free strand. No new bite is driven in this brief window; it functions as staging and strand management. Visible count along the right wound remains at four completed stitches.

Progressing inferior-to-superior with simple interrupted stitches
The operator then continues placing stitches along the same right incision, largely marching from the lower/mid segment up toward the superior end:

- 45.0–59.0 s: Working over the lower‑mid portion of the right wound, the left hand drives the needle (loaded about two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the surface) across the incision while the right hand tensions the existing suture and everts the edge with fingers. A new interrupted stitch is placed and secured on this line. The visible tally increases from four to five completed simple interrupted stitches.

- 60.0–74.0 s: Still on the right incision, a new bite is taken at the lower portion. The needle is grasped approximately two‑thirds from the tip and driven from right to left; scissors momentarily enter to prepare for trimming but cutting is not completed here. In these frames, four completed stitches are seen while the new bite is being positioned but not tied, an apparent discrepancy in visibility relative to the prior segment that likely reflects angle and cropping rather than removal of knots.

- 90.0–104.0 s: At the inferior end of the same right‑side incision, the left hand drives the needle and then switches to scissors; the right hand uses forceps to evert the right dermal edge and manage the thread. A fresh interrupted stitch is placed, tied, and cut at the bottom of the line, and by the end of these frames six completed stitches are visible along the right incision (five pre‑existing plus the newly tied inferior stitch).

- 105.0–119.0 s: Continuing superiorly on the right incision, the needle is advanced in a controlled arc with the needle holder while Adson forceps evert the dermis. A new bite is taken near the top of the line and the suture is pulled through, but no knot is tied in these frames. Five completed stitches are visible; the untied pass is staged for the next tie, again underscoring how the in‑frame count can reflect whether a pass has been secured yet.

- 120.0–134.0 s: The right wound is the sole focus. The right hand holds the needle holder; the left alternates between forceps to evert the edge and a second driver to perform instrument ties. One newly placed stitch in the mid‑portion is tied and seated with tip‑to‑tip instrument ties. By the end, the line shows five completed stitches (an increase from four visible earlier in this segment as the knot is secured).

- 135.0–149.0 s: Near the upper third of the same right wound, the left hand’s needle driver crosses from left to right; the right hand’s forceps stabilize and evert the near/right edge. The needle, loaded at its proximal third, is driven perpendicular through the tissue with symmetric bites, preparing another stitch superior to those already in place. No tie is completed within these frames; four completed stitches remain visible below the working area.

- 150.0–164.0 s: The operator ties and trims along the right‑side incision. The left hand holds the needle driver over the wound; the right hand alternates between forceps to control the standing end and fine scissors to trim tails. With throws formed and seated, by the end of the sequence five completed interrupted stitches are visible on the right incision.

- 165.0–179.0 s: Work remains concentrated at the superior portion of the right wound. The needle is driven through far and near dermal edges with the left‑hand driver, the right hand everting with forceps and then trimming with scissors. A new stitch is placed, tied, and the tails cut. Four completed stitches are visible by the end of this clip. The variability in the visible tally here versus adjacent clips reflects changing field of view and which segment of the line is captured, not a change in technique.

Interleaved off‑line demonstrations on the central slit
At several points, the operator performs isolated teaching passes on the central incision. For completeness: at 0.0–14.0 s, one stitch is placed and tied on the central slit; at 30.0–44.0 s, a bite is placed and tied on the central incision; at 75.0–89.0 s, the needle is prepared to pass on the central line; and later at 180.0–194.0 s and 195.0–209.0 s, additional central passes and ties create one then two visible stitches on that separate wound. Further central activity appears again at 240.0–254.0 s (initiation of a pass), 300.0–314.0 s (one stitch tied), and 330.0–344.0 s (another pass begun). These central‑line actions occur between steps on the right‑edge wound and are not part of the ongoing right‑side closure being tracked; they are separate demonstration bites and short sequences showing the same simple interrupted technique on an alternate line.

Returning to and advancing the right‑edge closure
The bulk of the procedure continues along the right edge incision, with a consistent alternation between needle passage, instrument ties, and occasional trimming:

- 210.0–224.0 s: On the right wound, a stitch at the superior end is tied and tails are cut. The needle is then reloaded for the next pass, with the left hand on the driver and the right hand everting with forceps and occasionally managing the tail. By the end of this sequence, five completed interrupted stitches are visible.

- 225.0–239.0 s: Still on the right‑edge incision, the operator places the next bite at the superior portion. The needle is loaded about one‑third from the swage, perpendicular to the dermis, and driven in a short, controlled arc while the right hand’s forceps present the edge. Five completed stitches are visible along the lower two‑thirds; the new stitch is in progress and remains untied in these frames.

- 255.0–269.0 s: At the top of the right incision, a new stitch is placed. The right hand controls the driver over the superior end while the left hand intermittently reenters with forceps or a second driver to manage the pass. The needle is driven through the far/right edge first, then across to the near/left. The pass is completed but not yet tied; five completed stitches remain visible.

- 270.0–284.0 s: The superior‑most bite at the right wound is driven with left‑hand driver control; the right hand’s forceps stabilize and evert the far/right edge. The needle is grasped near its midpoint and oriented perpendicular to the wound edge, then advanced across to complete the pass. The suture loops are visible above the site, and five completed stitches remain visible; the new stitch is not yet tied.

- 285.0–299.0 s: Work continues at the superior end of the right incision. The left hand drives the needle while the right hand’s forceps lift first the right edge then the left edge to retrieve the needle. Four completed interrupted stitches are present along the line; the fifth stitch is in progress and not tied in this interval.

- 315.0–329.0 s: The operator uses instrument ties to secure a newly placed stitch at the top of the right wound. The left hand holds the driver and forms loops; the right hand controls the tail just to the right of the wound. After tightening, the count increases from four to five completed stitches along this line. No cutting is shown.

- 345.0–359.0 s: At the superior end, the operator transitions from needle passage to hand‑tying. Left hand forceps briefly evert the edge, then both hands converge centrally for throws. Five completed stitches are visible along the incision before and during these frames; a sixth stitch is being tied at the top but not fully documented as completed within these frames.

- 375.0–389.0 s: Continuing at the top of the same right incision, the left hand manages the long free end while the right hand uses a needle holder for instrument ties. The throws are formed and seated; the sequence shows a fifth stitch being tied during these frames, with earlier four completed stitches present at the start. Tails are not trimmed here.

- 390.0–404.0 s: In the mid‑portion of the right incision, the operator alternates driver and forceps to complete knot advancement and snugging for a newly placed stitch. The forceps help to lift/evert while the knot is seated without excessive blanching, maintaining alignment. At the start, four completed stitches are visible; following tie advancement, the line shows five completed stitches along the incision. No cut is shown in these frames.

Final positioning and end state on the right‑edge wound
In the last interval (405.0–414.0 s), attention remains on the right‑side incision. A needle holder enters from the top‑center and briefly grasps the needle near the swage, tensioning and repositioning the standing part at the wound’s superior end. No new bite is driven, no edges are actively grasped, and no knot is tied in this short sequence. The previously placed stitches maintain approximation with even spacing. In these final images, four completed interrupted stitches with knots and tails are clearly visible along the right‑edge incision.

Hand and instrument choreography across the case
Across the entire session on the right‑side wound, the hand roles and spatial relationships remain consistent and demonstrate sound technique:

- The needle is consistently held at the proximal third to midpoint in the needle driver, with the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin to promote orthogonal dermal bites.

- The assisting hand uses Adson/tissue forceps to grasp the dermal edge being pierced, lifting and everting just enough to present the target tissue and prevent edge inversion. When tying, the assistant often switches to manage the standing end or tail, maintaining gentle, direct-line tension while loops are formed.

- During instrument ties, the two instruments work tip-to-tip directly over the incision, forming throws that lie flat and snug on the epidermal surface. Knots are seated without excessive blanching. Trimming is done with fine scissors introduced from the side opposite the driver, usually crossing the wound with deliberate, controlled movements.

- The work pattern advances superiorly: once a stitch is placed and tied at one level, the team reloads the needle and moves a few millimeters cranial to place the next pass, keeping spacing in the 3–5 mm range with short tails and slight edge eversion. When bites are staged but not yet tied, the suture is kept out of the field, often trailing superior‑laterally to avoid tangling the instruments.

Technique consistency and minor observational discrepancies
The technique throughout on the right incision is consistently simple interrupted suturing: perpendicular needle entry, symmetric dermal bites, edge eversion with forceps, instrument ties, then tail trimming. At several points, the visible count of completed stitches fluctuates between four, five, and six across adjacent clips. These fluctuations correspond to differences in camera framing (e.g., focusing on the upper segment where fewer knots are in view), intervening off‑line demonstrations on the central incision, and segments where a pass is in progress but not yet tied. The operator does not change technique or pattern; rather, the visibility of the previously placed knots varies. Where counts conflict between adjacent clips, this is best interpreted as a field‑of‑view limitation rather than a change in the number of placed stitches on the right wound within that short interval.

Completed suture count progression observed on the right incision
- Early visualization on the right wound shows four completed stitches; tensioning and reloading occur without new placement.
- Shortly thereafter, a new stitch is placed and tied, bringing the visible count to five.
- At the inferior end, a newly tied stitch brings the count momentarily to six visible stitches.
- Multiple segments show additional bites being placed near the superior end with tying sequences that return the line to five clearly visible stitches.
- Near the conclusion, tying at the superior and mid segments again shows five completed stitches in-frame after a knot is seated.
- Final view (405.0–414.0 s) shows four completed interrupted stitches clearly visible along the right‑edge incision; no additional placement or tying is captured in this final window.

Final state and mandatory count verification
By the final frames, the right‑edge incision is approximated with four completed simple interrupted sutures visible in the field, with knots and short tails aligned and the edges everted gently without blanching. No new bites are taken and no additional knots are tied in the closing seconds; the needle is merely tensioned/repositioned above the superior end. Therefore, the procedure, as last seen, results in four completed sutures visible on the right‑side incision.

Summary
Across the session, the operator repeatedly returns to the right‑edge wound and advances its closure cranially using simple interrupted sutures. Hand positions are consistent: the driver approaches perpendicular to the skin, forceps on the far/right edge provide eversion and counter‑traction, and instrument ties are used to secure each stitch before proceeding. Off‑line demonstrations on the central incision appear between these steps but do not alter the ongoing work on the right wound. While the number of knots visible within intermediate frames varies with framing and whether a pass is tied, the final view shows four completed sutures on the right incision, with the last action being tensioning and positioning of the suture near the superior end.
