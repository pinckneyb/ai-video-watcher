Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Four completed simple interrupted sutures approximate the incision with knots parked consistently to the right. Needle handling is competent: passes are near 90 degrees with reasonable bite symmetry, and forceps use is measured. Knots are square and lie flat; tails are trimmed appropriately. The closure achieves good approximation with slight eversion and no evidence of strangulation. Areas for improvement: plan the line to cover the full wound length with more uniform spacing, especially avoiding clustering superiorly and leaving an under-addressed inferior segment. Commit to each pass with fewer regrips and less time spent dressing knots to improve flow. Maintain strict perpendicular entry and consistent bite width and depth on both sides to further reduce minor obliquity. Overall, sound fundamentals with room to tighten precision and efficiency.
