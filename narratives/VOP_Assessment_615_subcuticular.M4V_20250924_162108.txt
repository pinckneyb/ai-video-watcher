COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator settling over the simulated skin block, instruments already in hand and focused on the vertical incision closest to the left edge of the pad. From the outset the left-sided incision is the sole target of instrument activity; all needle drives, suture management, and tissue handling remain concentrated on that same linear wound throughout the recording, even though occasional short-lived frames reference adjacent cuts — those are transient or represent repositioning of instruments above the pad rather than a sustained change of focus.

Initial approach and first bites (0:00–0:44)
At the start the left hand consistently holds the needle driver while the right hand provides tissue control with Adson-style pickups or bare fingertips, depending on the moment. The needle — a curved taper-point — is routinely grasped in the driver at a point typically around the junction of the middle and distal third through the proximal-to-middle third of its arc. The driver is held so the needle comes down near-perpendicular to the skin surface, allowing a predictable wrist-driven rotation to guide the tip through the dermis.

The assistant hand (right) alternates between seizing the near wound edge to evert and present dermis for entry and managing the free suture strand as the needle is advanced and retrieved. These early frames show repeated loading of the needle, controlled alignment of the arc with the wound, and careful perpendicular entry into one edge followed by passage across the gap to exit the opposite edge; after each pass the suture is pulled through and tensioned to leave a neat free tail that is kept clear of adjacent incisions. Eversion is achieved with brief lifts rather than sustained crushing — the pickups grasp close to the margin and tent the tissue to expose the dermal layer.

Establishing a working rhythm (45:00–119:00)
As the work proceeds the team establishes a steady rhythm. The left-hand driver approaches from the operator’s left, coming down slightly superior or lateral to the incision line; the right-hand pickups reciprocate from the right or from directly over the wound depending on the bite. Needle grips are adjusted and regrasped often: after driving the needle the driver will either be reloaded for a subsequent motion or the right hand will take the needle tip with forceps to guide extraction and handoff. The arc of the needle is consistently used to make near-perpendicular bites spaced a few millimeters from the wound margin, preserving symmetry between entry and exit points.

Throughout this phase the operator focuses on placing individual passes along the mid-portion and inferior portion of the incision. The suture strand is managed carefully — when not being used for a tie it is drawn across the pad and kept draped toward the superior-left or superior-right as appropriate, avoiding entanglement with neighboring slits. The right hand occasionally works with gloved fingertips instead of forceps to evert the near lip, indicating flexibility in tissue handling depending on immediate needs.

Working along the length and repeat passes (120:00–209:00)
Attention shifts to the superior and middle segments of the incision as the operator advances along the wound. Bites are repeated in sequence along the same line, and previously placed stitches are visible earlier on the superior end while the operator works more inferiorly or vice versa depending on the moment. The pattern is consistent: present the near edge with pickups, rotate the needle through the tissue with a wrist-driven arc, receive the needle tip on the far side with forceps, and pull the suture through, leaving a controlled tail.

Needle management becomes a noticeable theme: the operator frequently repositions the needle by regrasping it at different points along its body — sometimes near the proximal third, sometimes toward mid-body — to suit the trajectory required for the next bite. When the needle is brought across the gap the forceps follow the tip closely and often grasp it on exit, enabling the driver to release and then re-grip for the next driving motion. There are moments where both hands briefly withdraw or reposition above the pad to reorganize the strand and avoid crossing sutures, but the work quickly returns to the same linear wound.

Progressive closure and refinement (210:00–299:00)
As the sequence continues, multiple adjacent passes begin to approximate the wound edges progressively. Earlier stitches toward the superior end are seen bringing the dermal margins into closer apposition, and the operator advances to fill the remaining open length. At these stages the hands work in tight coordination: the needle driver remains lateral to the incision while the forceps present or lift the near lip and then receive the needle on the far side. The bites are taken at a consistent offset from the edge to maintain uniform purchase of dermis without excess tissue taken.

Suture management again draws attention: as the suture line lengthens the right hand alternates between controlling the free limb to maintain slack and pulling the strand through after a pass. Near the end of a segment the left hand may pause to allow the right to use scissors and trim the suture tail, indicating a completed tying step or the end of a threaded run in that region. While knot-tying is rarely captured in full within individual clusters of frames, the trimming of suture suggests knot security and finalization of earlier bites.

Reloading, cutting, and completion behaviours (300:00–374:00)
Later frames show continued, meticulous placement of stitches along the superior segment of the same incision. The driver and pickups retain their alternating roles: the driver directed needle motion from the operator’s left while the right hand controls tissue or receives the needle tip. When prior stitches approximate the edges, tissue manipulation decreases — eversion is lighter and forceps are either rested on the table or used intermittently to control the suture limb rather than to present tissue for initial entry.

There are moments in this middle-late portion where a scissors briefly appears in the left hand to trim a suture tail from a knot that must have been tied off between frames. This trimming occurs with the driver holding the needle or repositioning it for further bites, showing that tying and trimming were interleaved with additional passes rather than at the absolute end only. The operator maintains a clear working corridor by shifting hands marginally superior or lateral to avoid crossing the strand as the suture length accumulates.

Final passes and inspection (375:00–404:00)
In the last segments the superiormost part of the incision shows multiple previous stitches that have already approximated the dermal margins. The operator’s focus shifts from placing new full-depth bites to managing the remaining strand and tidying up the field. The needle is reloaded and positioned over the wound for possible additional minor adjustments, but several frames capture both hands hovering or operating off the tissue — the driver and the other hand moving above the superior edge to adjust the remaining suture slack.

One of the last clear actions is the trimming of a suture tail — a left-hand scissors cut that severs an excess limb from a prior knot — followed by repositioning of the needle for any minor finishing passes. At the very end both hands withdraw with the wound edges held in approximate anatomic alignment; the region that began as a gaping linear cut is now narrowed and approximated along its length by the placed stitches.

Technique consistency and development across the entire case
From start to finish a consistent suturing approach is used: the needle is repeatedly presented with the arc oriented for perpendicular entry, the near edge is everted and stabilized to expose dermis, and the far edge is received and controlled on exit. The operator favors wrist-driven rotations of the driver to advance the curved needle, periodically regrasping the needle at different points on its body to maintain control during varied arc requirements. Forceps are used purposefully to evert tissue without crush injury; when gentle fingertip control suffices the right hand sometimes substitutes the pickups for finer manipulation.

The overall pattern reflects disciplined, repeated single-bite passes placed sequentially along the length of the wound, with suture management (drawing the strand through, tensioning, avoiding entanglement) interleaved between placements. When knots are needed they are tied and the tails are later trimmed; however, many individual frames show bites being laid without clear capture of the knot-tying process, indicating that tying may have been performed off-camera or between frame clusters. Needle reloading and mid-procedure needle transfers between driver and forceps are common and handled efficiently.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Left-hand dominance of the needle driver is a constant: it works from the left side of the field and approaches the incision from lateral or superior-lateral positions. The right hand alternates between pickups, fingertips, and occasionally scissors. Early in the sequence the right hand is more frequently involved in active edge eversion with forceps; later the right hand spends more time managing the long suture limb, receiving the needle tip on exit, or trimming tails.

Spatially the instruments maintain a coordinated opposition across the wound — driver on the operator’s left, forceps or fingertips on the operator’s right — producing a roughly 90-degree approach angle for most bites. The hands occasionally cross anterior to one another to pull suture across or to retrieve the needle, but they generally preserve separate working zones a few millimeters above and lateral to the incision to maintain visibility and avoid entanglement with previous stitches. When the suture strand becomes long the operator keeps it draped away from adjacent slits and adjusts hand positions to prevent inadvertent contact with unused cuts.

Consistency, refinement, and final state
Throughout the recording there is a clear and consistent technique that matures into a practiced, rhythmic sequence: present, drive, receive, draw through, tension, and repeat. Eversion of the edges is consistently sought to optimize dermal apposition, and needle passage routinely follows the curvature for symmetric entrance and exit points. The operator uses regrasping and needle handoffs to maintain precision and employs trimming of suture tails to tidy the repair as segments are completed.

By the end, the originally gaping vertical incision near the left margin of the pad is approximated along its length by a succession of placed stitches. Several proximal bites appear to have already pulled the superior margins into close apposition, while intermediate and inferior segments have been closed incrementally. The final frames show the surgeon trimming suture tails and repositioning instruments with the wound edges approximated, the suture line clear of the adjacent unused slits, and the working field neatly arranged — indicating the repair is functionally complete and cosmetically attended to. Minor inconsistencies in the documentation (occasional frames that reference the adjacent slit or show hands briefly off the wound) do not change the continuous focus on the left-edge incision and the steady progression from initial bite placement to a closed and trimmed repair.
