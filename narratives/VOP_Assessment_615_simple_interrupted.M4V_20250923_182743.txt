COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on a three‑incision practice pad with the intent to close a single straight, vertical slit using simple interrupted technique. The left‑hand slit already shows completed stitches from prior work and is never engaged during this sequence; the right‑hand slit remains open during most of the session. The work focuses on the central slit throughout, advancing from the first bite through a methodical series of passes and instrument ties that progressively approximate its edges and finish with orderly tail trimming. At scattered moments, the operator briefly manipulates a lateral incision—these diversions do not alter the primary course of closure and are noted as off‑line activity. The core narrative that follows traces the complete trajectory of the middle wound closure as the sole suture line being developed.

Getting started, the needle driver is brought in over the middle incision from a superior position, held predominantly in the left hand. The right hand carries Adson or blue‑handled tissue forceps and works just lateral to the wound edge to present tissue for the bite. The needle is mounted consistently in the driver near the mid‑body or the proximal third to mid‑third of the curve—often around two‑thirds from the needle tip—so that its curvature can be driven through the synthetic dermis in a controlled forehand arc. Early on, a first bite is taken across the middle slit. The forceps gently pinch the dermal edge on the near side to evert it, the needle tip is aligned perpendicular to the surface, and the arc is advanced through that edge and then across to the far edge at a matching depth and margin distance. As the needle exits, the driver re‑grasps the needle to complete the pull‑through, and the suture strand is drawn across the gap without snagging on the pad. The pass is symmetrical, with depth matched on both sides to promote even approximation as tension is applied. At this stage there is no knot; the strand is simply oriented to create a clear lane for tying.

With the first pass in place, the driver transitions immediately to instrument tying. The needle is parked safely off to the right side on the long end of the strand, and the driver now alternately grasps the standing or the free end to form sequential throws. The right hand maintains gentle counter‑tension on the tail. The throws are laid flat, centered over the incision, with the driver crossing over the wound line to catch the tail and then snug each loop down. The edges come together under direct vision, without strangulation; the eversion achieved during needle passage is maintained as the knot is seated. Once secure, scissors enter briefly to trim the tails to short, neat ends. This cadence—pass, tie, trim—sets the pattern for the remainder of the case.

After trimming, the operator reloads a fresh bite. The left hand again holds the driver over the center incision, while the right hand returns with forceps to present the next bite site. With the needle grasped perpendicular to the skin, the driver approaches the near/right edge, the forceps lift the margin to promote eversion, and the needle is driven through the dermis. The right hand may briefly stabilize the needle tip or the emerging suture as it arcs across to the far side. The strand is drawn through cleanly and organized to one side so it won’t obscure the next maneuver. Once the pass is completed, the driver shifts purpose: the needle is set aside, and multiple instrument throws secure this new interrupted stitch. Again, the throws are delivered squarely over the incision with the right hand controlling the short tail; the knot is cinched down in line with the prior knot, creating a tidy sequence at the center of the wound.

This cycle repeats. Often, the driver is kept centered and vertical over the wound axis while the right hand works just lateral to the near edge to either deliver the tissue to the needle or manage the suture loop during tying. The needle is consistently grasped two‑thirds from the tip and oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin, which gives the operator precise arc control and bite depth. Bites are taken as mirror images on each side of the incision to align the dermal planes and promote slight edge eversion. The suture is drawn through in a controlled fashion, taking care to keep prior stitches undisturbed. After each pass, the driver is used for instrument ties, the knot is snugged down in line with the wound, and, when indicated, scissors trim the tails.

The work proceeds in an orderly fashion along the central slit. The operator alternates between placing a new bite just distal or proximal to the last knot and tying it before moving on. As new stitches accumulate, the wound edges in the middle third of the incision come together with even spacing. When the right hand uses the forceps, it does so delicately—grasping the dermal margin rather than crushing the epidermis—keeping the bite points consistent a few millimeters from the cut edge. The occasional re‑grasping of the needle in the driver ensures that the curvature remains aligned for a forehand pass, and the driver maintains a vertical approach perpendicular to the tissue plane. During some sequences, the right hand briefly holds the suture tail rather than tissue to manage loop tension and prevent the strand from riding high; this helps keep the knot centered and low as the throws are laid.

Midway through the closure, the operative field shows several completed knots across the central slit, with open gaps remaining at the ends. The team continues to work this same line. The left hand (dominant with the driver) comes in from a slightly superior‑left orientation, while the right hand picks up the right wound edge and presents it to the needle. The needle is advanced from right to left across the midline in a controlled arc, the suture is drawn through and gently tensioned, and the driver initiates instrument ties with the short tail on the right side. The throws alternate orientation to lock the knot flat; the edges come together with modest eversion, and the knot is seated directly over the midline. Once the knot is set, the scissors again come in from the right to trim tails, with the driver stabilizing the knot.

As the line progresses, there are several sequences focused on the craft of tying rather than new tissue passes: the needle remains parked, the driver grasps the suture limb to complete secure, flat knots, and the right hand alternates between holding forceps and bringing in scissors to cut. When cutting, the scissors approach from the right‑lower quadrant, blades parallel with the incision to avoid nicking the skin, and tails are trimmed short to maintain a clean field. At other times, the operator pauses to reload the needle and organize the strand without taking a new bite, making sure the suture is not twisted and the curvature is set for the next forehand pass. These moments of strand management set up smooth subsequent entries and exits and avoid torque on the needle.

New passes resume in the central wound where open gaps remain between existing stitches. The right hand lifts the near/right dermal edge with forceps, the left hand advances the needle, and the pass is executed across to the far side with symmetric bite depth. Each time, the driver re‑grasps the needle to complete the exit cleanly, prevents undue torque on the wound edge, and pulls the strand across to the right. After the pass, the driver shifts back into tying mode; the right hand manages the free end, occasionally using the forceps to hold the tail during throw formation. The knot is cinched down without excessive compression, preserving perfusion at the margins. Tails remain short and neat after trimming. With each cycle, the row of simple interrupted knots lengthens along the central incision, evenly spaced and centered over the wound line.

At one point, the operator’s hand positioning reverses briefly—using the right hand with the needle driver over the middle‑upper portion of the central slit while the left hand supports with forceps—yet the principles remain the same. The driver maintains perpendicular orientation, the forceps lift the edge just enough for a controlled entry, and the pass is executed with symmetrical depth across the dermis. After the needle exits and the strand is drawn through, the driver resumes instrument tying and secures the knot. This demonstrates ambidextrous control without changing the technique.

Late in the closure, the central line shows a tidy series of stitches with small, consistent gaps remaining toward the distal end. The left hand remains the primary driver hand; the right hand presents tissue at the right edge, then transitions to manage the short end during tying. The needle is still grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, swung in a forehand arc across the incision, and the suture is pulled through without dragging across the skin excessively. The driver forms successive instrument throws; the right hand pulls the free end laterally to generate friction and cinches each loop flat. The knot is seated low, directly over the midline. In a subsequent sequence, the left hand stabilizes the field with the driver while the right hand brings in scissors to cut tails flush to the knot, trimming just above the surface and avoiding the wound edges.

As the central slit nears completion, the operator continues placing additional simple interrupted stitches in the remaining open segments. The spacing remains even, the edges are approximated with slight eversion, and the suture line looks orderly with knots aligned down the midline. During one series of frames, the visual impression could be misread as a continuous line due to the way the strand drapes; in practice, the stitching remains simple interrupted—each new pass is tied before moving on, and there is no continuous traversal through successive bites without tying. This consistency is supported repeatedly by the sequences showing instrument ties after each pass and frequent trimming of individual knots.

Throughout, the spatial choreography is disciplined and reproducible:
- The needle driver stays centered, perpendicular to the incision line, hovering just above the targeted bite site.
- The forceps work on the near/right edge to lift and evert the dermis and occasionally hop to the opposite edge to verify symmetric depth.
- After each pass, the right hand releases tissue to manage the suture tail for tying, while the left hand executes the throws with the driver.
- During cutting, scissors approach from the right‑lower side while the driver stabilizes the knot, ensuring precise tail lengths and protecting the skin.

On a few occasions, activity is seen on a lateral incision—most often the right‑hand slit. These segments include a preparatory needle alignment at the rightmost cut, one or more simple passes there, and, in a later moment, a knot being secured and tails cut on that lateral wound. These are not part of the central closure being developed and appear as separate, non‑overlapping demonstrations on an adjacent incision. Where these off‑line actions occur, the central wound is either not being manipulated or is already secured in the regions visible. In keeping with the consistent technique on the central line, the off‑line work reflects similar principles—perpendicular approach, gentle eversion with forceps, symmetric bites, instrument ties—but it does not alter the state or sequence of the central closure.

Returning to the middle slit, the final operative sequences show new passes placed in the distal third where a gap remains, followed by instrument tying to secure these stitches. The right hand continues to provide counter‑traction on the short end, and the left hand lays down successive throws with the driver, cinching the knots squarely over the wound. The edges, already approximated proximally, come together in the remaining open areas. After each knot is seated, the right hand trims tails to short, tidy ends, leaving minimal excess. Additional passes are added sequentially until the previously open distal portion is closed in the same even pattern established from the start.

By the end of the session, the central incision is closed with a series of simple interrupted stitches that are evenly spaced and aligned, each knot centered over the midline with short tails. The dermal edges are neatly approximated with mild eversion and without overt blanching, suggesting appropriate tension. The left‑hand incision remains unchanged from its pre‑existing closure, and the right‑hand incision, though intermittently manipulated in separate moments, is not part of the tracked closure and does not affect the completed state of the middle line. The final appearance of the central wound reflects consistent needle handling—grasp at the mid‑to‑proximal third of the curve, perpendicular entry, controlled arc—delicate tissue management with the forceps to minimize trauma while achieving eversion, and methodical instrument ties after each pass with careful tail trimming. The closure proceeds steadily along the incision until the remaining gaps are closed, leaving a uniform, well‑organized row of knots and approximated skin edges across the full length of the central slit.
