COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure is focused on the left-most incision on the practice skin pad — the vertical slit located at the pad’s left edge (upper-left quadrant when the pad is oriented to the camera). From the opening frames through to the end of the recording, the operator returns repeatedly to that same leftmost wound, advancing and securing a single continuous repair along that line. The following narrative reconstructs the closure step-by-step, describing needle handling, tissue interaction, instrument and hand positions, the evolving suture passage, and the final state of the repair.

Initial approach and early passes (0–120 s)
The case begins with the operator positioned over the left-most vertical incision. From the first seconds the right (dominant) hand consistently controls a small needle driver or needle-holding instrument while the left (non-dominant) hand uses fine tissue forceps (Adson-style pickups) to elevate, evert, and stabilize the wound edge. The practitioner routinely grasps the curved needle in the driver near the shaft or mid‑body rather than at the very tip; this mid-to-distal hold enables controlled rotation of the curve through short, precise arcs. Needle arcs are oriented to pass from lateral toward medial across the incision and are taken at a shallow angle aimed at a superficial dermal/epidermal bite of the synthetic skin.

During these early passes the hands are kept tight over the wound — typically within 1–4 cm of one another — with the needle driver approaching from a slightly superior/medial direction and the forceps providing counter-traction lateral/inferior to the bite. The forceps presentation elevates and everts the near edge so the needle can take a correct tissue purchase; the operator then either advances the needle through the opposite edge or withdraws it after passage while the suture is pulled through. Several frames show the suture being tensioned and the limbs managed immediately after each pass — the left-hand forceps or an assistant clamp periodically holds the suture tail while the right hand readies the next bite.

Technique in these frames is precise and conservative: short, controlled bites close to the wound margin produce minimal tissue bunching. At moments the work appears stepwise — a single bite is taken, the suture is pulled, and the operator prepares the next pass. Although isolated closures in other parts of the pad (center, right incisions) are visible as preplaced interrupted stitches, the entire active sequence continues on the left vertical defect.

Middle phase: repeated passes and progression toward a continuous line (120–300 s)
As the procedure progresses the operator maintains the same spatial relationship of instruments to the wound, but the pattern of passage develops into a sequential series of bites advancing along the left incision. The right-hand driver repeatedly rotates the curved needle through the tissue while the left-hand forceps presents the opposing edge and controls the suture tail. The needle is most often grasped at the mid-shaft or just distal to the swage which supports fine rotation and predictable needle curvature through the synthetic dermis. The driver approaches from slightly different angles at times (superior, medial, or cranial), while the left forceps shifts along the wound to provide optimal counter-traction for each successive bite; the hands cross and re‑orient around the same small area as necessary, but remain tightly coordinated.

Several sequences demonstrate the operator drawing the suture continuously along the incision — the needle is passed, the strand is pulled through, and without returning to an isolated tie the next bite is taken slightly adjacent to the previous one. In multiple frames the suture tail runs along the wound and the next pass is made from the same running strand rather than from a fresh thread. When the needle has been completely withdrawn from view the operator manages the suture loop and occasionally re‑grasps or repositions the tail with forceps to prepare the next bite. Tissue handling remains gentle: edges are approximated during each pass with slight eversion, and the forceps lift only the small margin required to present the dermis.

Throughout this middle phase the operator alternates between moments that resemble placement of interrupted sutures (single passes with suture manipulation and apparent preparation to tie) and a continuous, running progression where the same strand advances along the incision. These differing appearances are reconciled by the consistent presence of a single suture limb being advanced sequentially; occasionally the operator pauses to tension or adjust that strand before continuing.

Transition to finishing passes and knot preparation (300–420 s)
Moving into the later middle portion of the recording the suture line along the left-most incision is clearly visible as a continuous or sequentially advanced strand. The operator places sequential bites along either a straight vertical or gently curved portion of the wound, with each needle pass followed by controlled retrieval and tensioning of the suture limb. Hand positions become slightly higher on the pad as the repair progresses cranially along the incision; the right-hand driver often approaches from a superior/medial angle while the left-hand forceps moves ahead of the needle to present the next bite site.

Needle handling remains consistent: the curved needle is held mid-shaft to maximize control of rotational motion, the driver turns the needle through tissue in a predictable arc, and the left-hand forceps maintains counter-traction and alignment. At times the right hand is seen to approach the superior portion and draw the suture toward the top end of the incision, while the left hand either steadies the lower/adjacent tissue or grasps the emerging suture tail to maintain tension. Several frames illustrate the practice of withdrawing the needle after a bite, pulling the suture loop tight and arranging the strand along the incision before taking the next bite — a workflow that supports even tension distribution and consistent eversion.

In this phase there are intermittent moments where the operator appears to prepare for tying: the suture tail is manipulated, sometimes held with a hemostat or forceps, and the driver or another instrument is poised to form a throw. However, much of the work remains focused on advancing the suture continuously until the operator reaches the end of the intended closure zone. When the needle is absent from view, it has typically been passed and the operator concentrates on drawing the suture through and aligning the bites.

Final passes, tensioning and completion (420–480 s)
In the last third of the recording the operator completes the terminal passes near the superior extent of the left-most incision. The needle driver in the right hand is repeatedly positioned close to the superior/cranial entry point and the left-hand forceps holds the lateral/caudal edge or the suture tail. The final needle passes are taken with the same style — mid-shaft grasp, rotation through the wound edge, and retrieval of the suture followed by careful tensioning.

As each final bite is completed the practitioner pulls the suture to seat each bite, ensuring approximation with slight eversion. There are frames showing the hands shifting positions slightly: occasionally the left hand relinquishes the tissue edge to the right hand or a finger is used to steady the suture while the driver performs the last rotation. After the terminal pass the operator manipulates the suture tails in preparation for securing the line. In several frames the needle has already been removed from the field and the suture tail extends away from the incision; the left-hand forceps holds the wound margin while the right hand manages the knot-tying sequence and trimming.

At approximately the 465–479 s interval the operator appears to complete adjustment and tightening of the concluding stitch, holding the lateral edge with forceps while pulling and laying down the final throws. By the end of this segment the suture line is tensioned and arranged; the last frames that show the working area demonstrate an intact repair with the suture strand running along the length of the left vertical incision and a suture tail projecting from one end, while adjacent central and right incisions remain idle with previously placed interrupted stitches.

Technique development and consistency
Although some frames show behavior that is consistent with individual interrupted passes (needle insertion followed by suture manipulation and apparent knot preparation), the predominant pattern across the recording is sequential advancement of a single suture strand along the same left-sided wound. The operator’s handling develops from isolated single bites into a steady, rhythmic progression of adjacent bites that together form a continuous repair. The operator consistently uses a mid-shaft grasp of the curved needle in the driver, controlled rotation of the needle through the tissue, and coordinated counter-traction with fine forceps to present the margin. This technique remains consistent in grip and instrument orientation throughout the case; any apparent alternation between interrupted-appearing bites and continuous passage represents workflow steps (tensioning and suture management) rather than a change in the overall closure strategy.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Hands remain close to the incision throughout, typically separated by only a few centimeters. The right (needle-driving) hand typically approaches from superior/medial or slightly cranial angles and performs the arc of needle passage while the left hand positions the tissue and manipulates the suture tail. When advancing cranially along the incision the operator shifts both hands incrementally so the forceps move ahead to present the next bite while the driver rotates to pass the needle. During knot preparation or final tensioning the hands converge directly over the bite site with the left forceps anchoring the tissue and the right hand controlling the tail and driver. There are brief frames with no hands visible in other parts of the pad (e.g., an idle right‑side incision frame near the end), but these moments correspond to pauses after the left incision has been managed rather than a change of focus.

Tissue interaction and wound edge appraisal
Throughout the procedure the operator demonstrates careful tissue handling: bites are superficial, approximating the dermal edges without excessive inversion or excessive tension. The forceps consistently evert and present a small flap of tissue to allow the needle to take an adequate, superficial purchase. The synthetic dermis shows minimal bunching; each pass brings edges into close apposition, and the suture tension is controlled to avoid ischemia or puckering. At the conclusion there is mild eversion at the bite sites, which is a typical aim for skin closure to offset later inversion during healing.

Final state of the repair
By the end of the recording the left-most vertical incision is closed with a contiguous suture strand running along its length. The bites are evenly spaced and approximate the edges with slight eversion and uniform tension. The suture tail is managed and presented for final securing; the needle is no longer in view and the suture loop has been tensioned across the line. Adjacent incisions (center and right) remain with their pre-existing stitches and are not further manipulated. The last visible manipulations on the left line are adjustments and tightening of the final pass and arranging of suture tails for tying and trimming.

Notes on observed inconsistencies
Across different frames the motion sometimes resembles placing discrete interrupted stitches and at other times the progression appears continuous. These appearances are reconciled by the operator’s workflow: the same single suture strand is advanced stepwise along the left-most incision, with intermittent pauses to tension, arrange, or prepare the tail for the next pass or a final tie. While the synthetic model makes depth assessment imprecise, the operator consistently takes superficial, full‑thickness or dermal-level bites appropriate for skin closure and uses the needle driver/forceps pairing in the standard manner to maintain precise control.

Summary
From first approach to completion the surgeon focuses attention on the left-most vertical wound, using a curved needle held mid-shaft in a needle driver and fine forceps for counter-traction. The closure progresses as a series of controlled bites that are drawn, tensioned, and advanced along the incision. Hand positions remain compact and coordinated, with the right hand driving the needle and the left hand presenting tissue and managing suture tails. The repair concludes with evenly approximated edges, slight eversion at each bite, and the suture strand secured and arranged for final knotting and trimming — resulting in a well-controlled closure of the left-sided incision.
