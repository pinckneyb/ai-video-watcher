Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion and flow are disciplined: you maintain a consistent pass–tie–cut–reload rhythm, follow the needle’s curve, and alternate hand roles to preserve line of sight and ergonomics. Knot sequences are methodical with alternating, flat throws, and you routinely seat knots on center while preventing tissue torque. The field remains controlled with suture managed off the wound and minimal surface drag, yielding a stable, well-approximated closure.
