COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The field is a silicone suture pad with several parallel vertical slits, but all operative attention is focused on the straight midline incision that runs cranial–caudal. The edges are clean and parallel. In the earliest sequence, there are no prior passes visible at the intended start point along this midline wound, and the work begins by establishing purchase for a running closure. The left hand controls a needle driver positioned just left of the target line; the right hand uses fine forceps to lift the right wound edge to achieve eversion and to present the dermal layer. The curved needle is loaded in the driver at a stable purchase point—typically around the proximal third to midpoint of the needle body—with the needle’s arc kept perpendicular to the skin. With that alignment, the needle tip is brought to the near edge of the central incision and driven in a smooth rotational arc across the gap, setting the first bite. The suture trails out of the field without obstruction.

Immediately after this initiation, attention turns to securing the line so that subsequent passes can be advanced without losing tension. The left hand remains on the needle driver, hovering just to the left/superior side of the same wound; the right hand alternates between forceps to control the entry and exit points and managing the free suture strand. As the suture is drawn through, the edges are approximated and the operator uses instrument ties to secure the line near the lower third of the wound. Throws are tightened with controlled, wrist-driven motion while the forceps maintain gentle eversion. Scissors are introduced to trim excess tail once the anchor is set. The instruments briefly cross above the incision during tying but then separate again into their opposed roles on each side of the midline.

With the anchor established, the closure proceeds as a running sequence up the same wound. Working around the middle of the incision, the needle is reloaded repeatedly to maintain a perpendicular approach. The driver remains primarily to the operator’s left; the right-hand forceps evert and stabilize whichever edge is being engaged. The needle is advanced through the near edge and then across to the far edge using a controlled, wrist-driven rotation that preserves the needle’s curvature and trajectory. Bites are taken a few millimeters from the cut edge at matched depth, and the exit points are exposed by the right-hand forceps to keep the tip visible and protect the tissue from inadvertent crush. Each pass is drawn through and tensioned to align the wound edges without blanching or strangulation, and the suture is kept out of the needle path by draping it away from the bite site.

Along this central wound, the technique emphasizes symmetry and eversion: the forceps lift only the dermal/subdermal margin adjacent to the bite, and the operator avoids gripping too deeply or too forcefully. The driver periodically “recocks” the needle—regrasping it two-thirds from the tip or at the proximal third—so that each entry remains perpendicular to the skin surface. The free limb often trails inferiorly across the field or off to the operator’s right, depending on how the camera frames the action, but it is consistently managed so it does not obscure the next bite.

As the run advances, there are moments when the operator consolidates the segment that has just been placed. In one mid-sequence stretch, the suture from the recent pass is drawn through and instrument ties are applied at the mid-portion of the slit to lock the line and maintain even tension. At that point, short tails from earlier knots are trimmed with scissors. These interludes of tying are brief and are used to secure progress without interrupting the overall running pattern. The driver then reloads the needle and returns to the next bite immediately proximal to the last.

The next series of passes continues up the same midline incision. The left hand stays with the needle driver, and the right hand remains just ahead of the needle with Adson-type forceps, lifting the target edge to maintain eversion and expose the next entry and exit points. The bites are kept small and consistent, centered across the wound so that the line of entry and exit points remains straight up the midline. The operator’s control is consistently wrist-driven, avoiding sweeping motions. After each pass, the suture is drawn through smoothly, with the right hand occasionally guiding the tip of the needle or controlling the strand to keep it from tangling. When needed, the right hand briefly steadies the needle near the swage so the left hand can adjust the driver’s grasp without losing orientation.

Progressively, the closure extends into the superior half of the incision. The operator works just a few millimeters from the previous pass, keeping the working corridor tight and centered on the wound. The free limb lies off to the operator’s right at times—consistent with a continuous progression—and tension is taken up steadily to snug the approximated edges without inverting them. Throughout, the previously closed portion shows a neat approximation with mild eversion; short trimmed tails may be visible from earlier tie-downs along the line, but the ongoing technique remains a running sequence.

At intervals, scissors appear briefly to trim tails from previously secured points, after which the driver immediately regrips the needle to resume passing. The right-hand forceps sometimes transition from the wound edge to the needle itself to facilitate reloading in tight spaces, then return to the tissue to present the next edge. In one stretch, the right hand also manages the free strand to tension the prior segment while the left prepares for the next bite. The spatial relationship of the hands remains constant: instruments straddle the incision with a small, consistent working gap between them, both tips hovering within a few millimeters over the centerline of the wound. The needle holder’s tip approaches from the left, the forceps from the right, converging just above the target entry point and then separating as the needle completes its arc.

Further up the incision, the operator places a new pass just above the existing tied segment. The needle enters perpendicular to the near edge, follows its curved path through the dermis, and exits the far side at a mirror point. The right hand uses the forceps to expose the exit site and to pull the needle through gently, ensuring the tissue is neither crushed nor over-manipulated. The suture is then drawn through, set, and the line is tensioned evenly. Additional passes follow the same pattern several millimeters cephalad, each time maintaining the same bite width and depth, and aligning the entry and exit points so that the series of puncture marks stays centered over the wound.

As the run continues, the operator occasionally pauses to adjust the needle orientation. The driver regrips the needle at the proximal third of its curvature to restore a true perpendicular entry and to keep the needle’s arc aligned with the direction of travel. The right-hand forceps pick up first one edge and then the opposing edge, alternating sides to maintain symmetry. The suture line itself is now well-established through the midline of the incision: the already placed section is stable and evenly tensioned with mild, consistent eversion, and the working segment advances smoothly with each pass. Where short, trimmed ends are visible from earlier lockdowns or trimming of prior threads, they lie flush with the skin, not interfering with subsequent bites.

Near the upper portion of the wound, the operator introduces a small skin hook in addition to the pickups to enhance control of the right wound edge. Using the hook and pickups in tandem, the right hand elevates and stabilizes the edge precisely while the left hand maintains a perpendicular needle approach. The addition of the hook improves exposure and maintains consistent edge eversion as the needle traverses to the opposite side. After each pass, the suture is set and tensioned, and the operator advances to the next bite. The needle is reloaded between passes to preserve proper orientation; its grasp point is kept in the proximal mid-third of the arc to avoid bending or blunting the tip.

Throughout this upper segment, the line behaves like a classic running closure: the suture advances along the wound with sequential passes, the strand trailing away from the field and periodically managed to prevent entanglement. The driver stays centered over the wound, often slightly to the left of the midline, while the forceps and skin hook remain just lateral to the right edge, guiding entry and exit points. The spacing between passes is consistent, and the alignment of puncture marks remains straight. The eversion achieved by the gentle lift of the edges is maintained, and there is no evidence of tissue crushing.

As this sequence draws toward its end, the operator makes a final positioning movement with the needle holder over the mid-portion of the wound and then retracts without placing an additional pass. The previously placed stitches remain in situ, the approximation unchanged, and the instruments withdraw momentarily. At no point in the final frames is a new bite completed; rather, the appearance suggests a pause after tightening or trimming, with the wound remaining neatly approximated along the length that has been addressed.

Throughout the procedure, the hand dynamics are consistent and efficient. The left hand predominantly controls the needle driver, maintaining a firm but precise grasp on the needle at a point that allows a smooth, wrist-driven arc. When scissors are needed, the left hand briefly exchanges instruments to cut tails, then returns to the driver. The right hand manages the tissue with Adson-style pickups, lifting edges to present the dermis and to maintain eversion, occasionally steadies the needle tip during reloading, and frequently controls the free suture limb to manage tension and keep the field clear. In the later stages, the right hand also employs a skin hook for even finer control of the edge while the driver places the bite.

Spatially, the instruments remain in tight opposition across the same midline wound. The driver approaches from the operator’s left and slightly superior to the bite site; the forceps (and later the skin hook) stabilize the edge on the right side just ahead of the needle. The working gap is small and consistent, which helps ensure perpendicular entry, symmetric depth, and matched bite width on each side of the incision. The suture strand is kept off the wound path—trailing inferiorly or to the operator’s right—and is periodically tensioned to snug previous passes without distorting the wound edges.

Technique consistency is notable: every pass is set up with perpendicular needle orientation; the needle is regripped as needed to maintain that orientation; small, symmetric bites are taken across the incision; the edges are gently everted by precise forceps lifting; and the line is tensioned evenly after each pass. When ties are placed mid-run, they serve to lock tension and to neatly dress the line; any resulting tails are trimmed short. The overall effect is a progressive, orderly running closure along the central incision.

By the end of the captured sequence, the central vertical wound shows multiple, evenly spaced passes with mild, consistent eversion and straight alignment of entry and exit points along the midline. Portions of the line have been locked down and trimmed to keep the field tidy. The superior-most limit of the incision is approached with the same methodical technique, although the terminal tie-off of the run is not shown. The wound segments addressed are well approximated without inversion or gapping, and the handling throughout has minimized crush or trauma to the edges. While short trimmed tails are visible at intervals—likely remnants of lock-downs or earlier trimming at the line—they do not interrupt the continuity of the running closure that carries steadily along the midline from the lower third into the upper half of the incision.
