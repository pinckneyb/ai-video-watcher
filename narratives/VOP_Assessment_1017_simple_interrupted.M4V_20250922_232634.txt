COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video documents a straightforward cutaneous closure performed with simple interrupted sutures along a single linear laceration on the right side of a synthetic skin pad. The work proceeds methodically from the lower end upward, with the operator alternating between stitch placement and knot security, using instrument ties throughout. Camera viewpoint and field clutter intermittently obscure or complicate the visual cues, but the operative conduct and end result are consistent: the right‑sided vertical incision is progressively approximated with individual, well‑spaced stitches, leaving small gaps only near the superior and inferior poles by the end.

The opening segment shows the setup without active manipulation. A large identification card partially obscures the pad, and no hands or tools are present. Both vertical slits in the upper field remain open and undisturbed. This period functions as a preoperative pause while the field is set and aligned; there is no change in wound geometry.

The procedure begins at the lower portion of the right‑most vertical slit. The operator works bimanually: the left hand holds a needle driver, the right hand uses Adson forceps to control the skin edge. The curved needle is mounted in the driver at about two‑thirds from the tip, held perpendicular to the skin surface. With the right‑edge lower third exposed, the right‑hand forceps evert and stabilize the near lip to present tissue. The left hand advances the needle in a controlled arc through the near edge and then across to the far edge at a matching level, taking symmetric bites at a small, appropriate distance from the margin. The suture is drawn through and the thread trails across the field as the bite is completed. This initial stitch establishes the anchor at the inferior part of the wound and sets the pattern for subsequent passes: small, symmetric, perpendicular bites with gentle eversion and careful needle handling.

The view briefly shifts more medially, but the technique and goals remain identical—driver and forceps oppose each other across a vertical skin slit while the needle is advanced orthogonally through dermis and subdermis with a wrist‑driven arc. The driver is held by the same hand and the forceps by the other, with the needle grasp again at the proximal third from the swage to maintain control. The pass is smooth and deliberate, and the suture is drawn through, forming a loop across the gap in preparation for tying. The visual impression of a second nearby slit appears occasionally due to framing changes; regardless, the same closure plan continues uninterrupted along the right‑sided line.

Attention returns to the lower end of the right‑edge incision to secure the first stitch. The right hand now predominantly manages the needle holder, while the left hand controls the free limb of the suture. The needle, still attached to the standing end, is kept out of the wound to avoid inadvertent penetration. Instrument ties are performed: the driver and free limb alternate positions as loops are cast, transferred, and squared down. No separate tissue forceps are used during the tying sequence. The knot is cinched until the wound edges approximate with slight eversion, and the stitch is seated neatly at the inferior pole.

A similar tying sequence follows at the adjacent lower portion of the same incision. The operator again uses instrument ties, with the curved needle parked off to the patient’s right on the standing end while loops are formed around the driver. The driver’s role shifts from needle manipulation to suture handling, reflecting consistent technique for instrument ties. The free limb is controlled by the contralateral hand to maintain steady tension while throws are alternated to lock the knot. The scissors intermittently enter from the left to trim tails when a knot is completed. These segments demonstrate a reliable rhythm: pass, draw through, instrument ties, then trim.

With the lower anchor established and tails cut, the operator prepares for the next pass just above the first knot. The left hand holds the needle driver; the right hand returns to fine forceps. The forceps grasp the near/right edge, gently everting it while the driver presents the needle perpendicular to the skin from the patient’s right toward the left. The tip is positioned to enter the right margin at a measured distance from the cut edge, then advanced through the tissue in an arc to emerge on the far side. The edges come into precise apposition as the suture is drawn through, with no undue blanching or tearing. The driver maintains control of the needle throughout, then regrips to pull the strand clear and prepare for tying.

This pattern repeats: a pass in the lower third is followed by instrument tying close to the wound surface. The needle is sometimes kept mounted in the driver during the tie, but parked to the side of the wound to maintain safety and field clarity. The forceps are used sparingly during knot security—once the bite is complete, the operator favors pure instrument ties, with the driver holding the standing limb and the opposite hand managing the free end. Throws are alternated and squared, and each knot is advanced down until it sits directly over the puncture points without crushing tissue. Tails are trimmed with scissors approaching from above or from the left, the tips directed safely away from the wound.

As the closure marches superiorly along the right‑edge incision, the operator maintains consistent needle handling. The driver grasps the needle on the proximal third to two‑thirds of the curve, the arc remains nearly perpendicular to the skin, and the wrist rotation follows the needle’s curvature to minimize drag. Forceps provide gentle traction and eversion, sometimes aiding with needle pickup on the far side, sometimes simply presenting the tissue and then releasing once the pass is underway. Each bite mirrors its partner across the midline, with symmetric depth and distance from the margin. The result is a tidy row of interrupted stitches with subtle eversion and even spacing.

There are periodic pauses where no new passes are executed. In one such span, the left hand hovers with a needle driver over the right‑sided wound without clearly mounting a needle or presenting it to tissue. The wound edges remain approximated by the existing stitch; this appears to be a brief regrouping or instrument re‑positioning interval rather than a change in plan. Likewise, later segments show the driver or a hand briefly entering the field over the sutured area without grasping tissue or advancing a needle; again, these are non‑operative interludes focused on strand management, tension checks, or visualization.

Progressing upward, the next stitch is placed just above the previous one. The non‑dominant hand holds the driver over the incision, jaws vertical, while the dominant hand uses Adson forceps. The forceps alternately lift the near and far edges to expose the entry and exit sites, with a clear intent to keep bites small and symmetrical, preventing inversion. The needle arcs across cleanly, and the suture is pulled through. Instrument ties follow immediately: the driver forms loops around the standing limb; the opposite hand retrieves and maintains tension on the free end. Throws are laid in alternating directions to seat a square knot. Once the knot is snug over the wound line, scissors come in briefly to trim the tails before the next pass.

At times, the driver shifts to the other hand and the forceps to the opposite, but the relationship of instruments to wound is consistent. The driver typically sits superior/medial to the intended bite, crossing over the incision line in a controlled arc, while the forceps oppose it on the near edge to aid eversion and control. When tying, the driver and the free end cross above the incision as loops are cast; the long limb of suture often lies to the patient’s right, away from the work, to prevent tangling. The needle is kept safely to the side, on a segment of suture lateral to the wound, during knot security.

Through the mid‑portion of the incision, the closure cadence becomes fluid. A pass is made at a level slightly proximal to the previous knot; forceps lift and stabilize the right or left lip as needed, and the driver follows the needle’s curve across the gap. The suture is then drawn through the tissue, slack removed, and instrument ties are performed to seat a square knot over the skin. The next knot is often set while gently using the forceps for counter‑traction to prevent the knot from riding up. Tails are trimmed promptly, keeping the field clear for the next bite.

As more stitches accumulate in the mid‑segment, the surgeon maintains attention to eversion and spacing. The edges come together nicely, with mild eversion visible under each knot, and there is no evidence of strangulation or over‑tightening. Occasional repositioning of the strand across the incision helps maintain a clean working area. The left and right hands sometimes trade roles: in several sequences, the right hand holds the needle driver while the left manages the free limb or forceps, but the fundamental relationship—one instrument manipulating the needle, the other controlling tissue or strand—remains constant.

Beyond the mid‑portion, the closure advances into the upper half of the incision. New stitches are placed superior to the cluster of knots already seated below. The needle is again loaded two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin, and presented from the patient’s right toward the left. The red‑banded forceps are visible now and then, grasping the skin edges lightly to assist with eversion and to guide the needle tip on exit. The driver occasionally regrips the needle to complete the pass and to pull the suture through cleanly, avoiding torque on the tissue.

After each pass, the suture slack is drawn across the field to keep the operative site clear. The driver is used to form and seat instrument throws; the assistant hand maintains controlled counter‑tension on the free limb. The knot is advanced down onto the puncture points and squared with alternating throws. Scissors reappear to cut tails at appropriate lengths; when they are visible but unused, they rest off to the left side of the field.

As the work approaches the superior end, there are periods devoted purely to suture management and assessment. The right hand hovers with or without an instrument, manipulating the strand near the top where the next bite would be anticipated. No new needle passes are executed in these moments; instead, the operator adjusts tension, evaluates the approximation achieved by the existing row of stitches, and ensures that the strand and needle are parked safely lateral to the wound. The left hand remains off‑field during these brief assessments. The existing sutures maintain midline approximation with mild eversion; small gaps persist near the very top and bottom, as is typical before final corner stitches are placed.

Throughout, the spatial choreography is consistent and safe. The needle driver tends to work just superior and slightly medial to the incision, crossing midline for the pass and then retracting to neutral while the suture is drawn through. The forceps position on the opposing edge, grasping only enough tissue to evert and present the dermis without crushing. During ties, the driver and the free end alternate positions over the wound as loops are formed and transferred. The needle, when not in use, is parked off to the patient’s right on the standing limb of suture, kept clear of the wound and the operator’s hands to minimize risk. Scissors enter from above or from the left with tips oriented toward the knot, trimming tails closely without contacting the skin edges.

There are isolated segments where the camera seems to drift to a nearby short slit or where instruments hover without engaging tissue. In those instances, no change in overall closure strategy is seen; when tying is shown, it matches the same instrument‑tie technique used on the right‑sided incision, and when passing is shown, the bites, needle orientation, and hand roles are identical to the rest of the sequence. To the extent the framing occasionally suggests a separate cut, that appearance does not alter the continuous narrative of a single right‑sided linear laceration being closed with simple interrupted sutures from inferior to superior. Where the field is idle, the stitches already in place hold approximation while the operator reorganizes the strand or instruments.

By the final segments, the right‑sided wound bears a tidy run of individual knot stacks through its center and upper mid‑portion, with tails trimmed over each. The lower third has been secured earlier, its tails also cut. Near the very top and bottom of the slit, small gaps remain where corner stitches would typically be placed, but within the visualized course no additional bites are taken there. The last captured moments show the right hand briefly adjusting the suture near the superior end without committing to another pass; scissors rest off to the left and are not used. The row of interrupted stitches maintains approximation along the length addressed, with mild, uniform eversion and no evidence of tissue trauma or inversion.

In summary, the operator performs a consistent series of simple interrupted closures along the vertical right‑sided incision. The technique is classical: perpendicular needle entry, symmetric dermal bites, eversion with light forceps assistance, and instrument ties with the needle safely parked to the side. Hand roles alternate seamlessly as needed, but spatial relationships remain stable—driver above and across the wound for passes, forceps opposing for edge control, and scissors entering briefly to trim after knots are set. The closure progresses steadily from the inferior portion upward, consolidating a midline row of knots. The procedure concludes with the wound’s central and upper segments well approximated by several evenly spaced interrupted stitches, the edges gently everted, and only minor residual gaps visible at the extremes, consistent with a near‑complete interrupted closure captured just before any final corner bites.
