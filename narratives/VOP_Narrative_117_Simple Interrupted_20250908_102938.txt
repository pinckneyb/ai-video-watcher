COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on a synthetic skin pad with several short, linear incisions. The operator begins in the upper‑left/central area with classic two‑handed technique. The right hand uses Adson forceps to evert and present the near wound edge while the left hand, holding a needle driver, seats the curved needle at roughly 90 degrees and follows its arc cleanly across the small vertical slit. The needle is regrasped to complete the exit and the suture is pulled through, leaving a controlled tail.

Without changing sites, the operator transitions directly into instrument ties. The left hand keeps the needle driver near the knot while the right hand manages the free end, alternating tension across the incision to keep the knot centered and the edges approximated. Throws are laid down in opposite directions to square the knot, then the left hand switches to scissors to trim the tails neatly.

Next, attention returns to the superior‑left incision for another stitch. The right hand with pickups stabilizes and everts the near edge while the left hand positions the needle perpendicularly for a precise entry. The pass has already been made by the time the next sequence begins: the right‑hand driver draws the needle and suture through as the left hand with forceps protects the tissue, then the operator goes straight into tying. A smooth rhythm of instrument throws follows—driver in the left hand grasping the short end, right hand forming loops and maintaining counter‑tension—until the knot stacks down flush and secure.

After completing this stitch, the operator shifts to a small central vertical incision. The right hand briefly controls the needle/suture directly, then swaps to Adson forceps to hold and evert the right wound edge. The left‑hand needle holder reorients the needle on its proximal third, perpendicular to the skin, preparing to drive from left to right. The needle is passed and pulled through in a controlled arc; the driver regrips the tip to manage the exit, then the right hand takes over to reload the needle perpendicularly for the next bite. Rather than taking another pass immediately, the operator parks the needle away from the field and performs instrument ties, placing alternating throws while keeping the knot centered over the incision with minimal tissue lift. Once seated, the tails are cut close, and the right hand briefly brings a scalpel into view above the upper‑left slit, suggesting preparation for additional work (no cut is made at this moment).

The tying sequence on this recent stitch continues for a few more throws using a two‑instrument technique—left instrument controlling the post while the right‑hand needle holder loops and advances the long limb—then finishes with additional instrument ties using the left‑hand driver and right‑hand fingers. With the knot secure, the right hand trims the tails, keeping them short and tidy.

The operator returns to the upper‑left wound to place another simple interrupted stitch. The left hand again drives the needle with proper perpendicular orientation and follows the curve, while the right hand with pickups everts the edge and presents the far side. Symmetric bites are taken a few millimeters from each margin, the suture is pulled through, and the needle is parked. Instrument ties are executed efficiently with the needle kept safely away from the wound; the edges approximate with slight eversion, and the knot sits consistently on the left side of the incision. The sequence concludes with additional finishing throws and no excessive tension on the tissue.

With several stitches now in place along the left vertical incision, the operator shifts into a quality‑assurance phase. Using a single instrument in the right hand, they sequentially tension and “seat” the superior knots—brief, controlled lifts on individual strands to snug each knot down—while the left hand, when present, stabilizes the pad with fingertips. This progresses from the superior portion down the incision, confirming apposition and stack height without retaking bites. The scissors/driver is then used to trim the suture tails along these knots; the nondominant hand manages the strands and provides gentle counter‑tension during each cut. Attention briefly drifts toward the central incision as strands are organized, but no new passes are made.

A short debridement step follows at the superior lip of the left incision: with gold‑ring scissors in the right hand, the operator snips a small triangular flap to tidy the wound edge. Minimal counter‑traction is applied with right‑hand fingertips; forceps are not used. No suturing occurs during this maneuver.

There are then brief pauses where the field is empty and static. When the view resumes, the central incision is visible with a couple of short transverse suture segments and puncture marks suggesting planned or partial work, but no active adjustments are made. Finally, a gloved forearm crosses the field and removes the practice pad, ending the suturing session. In the closing moments, a suture package briefly enters the frame—packaging only, with no needle handling—signaling cleanup or setup for a future run.

Throughout, the flow is deliberate and modular: for each stitch, the operator establishes exposure with the non‑dominant hand, drives the needle perpendicularly with the dominant hand following its curve, pulls through with controlled regrips, parks the needle away, and completes secure, alternating instrument ties before cutting tails. Between stitches, they inspect, tighten, and trim in sequence, occasionally refining the wound edge with precise scissor work. The hand choreography evolves from two‑handed needle driving with forceps‑assisted eversion to single‑handed knot adjustments and tidy finishing, maintaining a consistent rhythm of pass–tie–trim across the left incision, a focused interlude on the central incision, and a disciplined close to the session.
