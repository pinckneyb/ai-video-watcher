COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure opens on a synthetic skin practice pad where a single vertical linear wound—positioned slightly left of the pad center—remains the focus throughout. From the outset the wound is an open full‑thickness skin slit a few centimeters long; there is already a column of previously placed skin sutures visible immediately adjacent to one side of the defect, and the operator proceeds to close the remaining open portion by placing sequential interrupted skin stitches along that same incision.

Initial approach and first passes (0–60 s)
The operator sets up with a curved, swaged needle mounted on monofilament suture and uses standard small suture instruments throughout: a ringed needle driver/holder and fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑type). Hands are gloved and enter the field in close opposition—typically within a few centimeters across the wound—so that one instrument drives the needle while the other provides counter‑traction and tissue control. Early passes show the needle held in the driver at or near the mid‑shaft/body, the arc of the needle presented to take perpendicular or slightly oblique bites through the dermis. The forceps consistently lift and evert the near edge to present dermis for capture; the driver rotates the needle tip through the opposite edge in a controlled arc so the tip exits the far side before the driver releases. Bites are small and close to the wound margins, approximating epidermal edges with slight eversion, and the suture strand is pulled through to prepare for knot tying.

Establishing the sequence and bimanual coordination (60–150 s)
As the operator continues, the pattern becomes clearly sequential: the needle is passed from one side to the other, the free suture tail is maintained by the non‑dominant instrument, and the driver withdraws the needle while the forceps bring opposing dermal margins into apposition. Hand dominance shifts occasionally between sequences—most commonly the left hand holds the needle driver approaching from the operator’s left or medial side with the right hand holding forceps laterally—but the relationship remains consistent: one hand drives the needle, the other manipulates tissue and suture tails. Grips on the needle vary slightly between frames—sometimes the driver is positioned nearer the distal third, at other times closer to the hub—but the purpose is the same: maintain a controlled arc to seat the needle through epidermal and dermal layers without crushing tissue. A ruler is visible in several frames as a non‑interfering reference; gauze appears intermittently to protect the entry point or to clear the field.

Progressing along the incision and tying technique (150–300 s)
The operator advances stitch placement progressively along the same incision. Each needle pass is followed by suture retrieval and knot formation: the sutures are tied using standard thumb‑and‑finger or instrument ties with the driver and forceps cooperating—one instrument tensions and orients the suture while the other places the throws. Knot securing is followed by trimming of suture tails with scissors or a second instrument. During this interval the hands often shift position relative to the wound: when placing a new bite the needle driver approaches from the side that enables the optimal angle for the needle arc; when tying and trimming, both hands cluster near the proximal or distal end of the most recently placed stitch. Tissue handling remains atraumatic—edges are lifted and everted, not excessively pinched, and bites are deliberately shallow to intermediate depth to capture dermis and achieve good epidermal apposition.

Continued sequential placements and small technique variations (300–420 s)
As the closures accumulate, the row of interrupted stitches lengthens. The operator’s technique remains predominantly simple interrupted closure: the needle is rotated through the near edge, passes through the gap, and exits the opposing margin where the thread is then managed for knotting. Subtle variations appear over time—grip point on the needle, angle of approach (perpendicular vs. a tangential, oblique insertion), and which hand serves as needle driver—indicate adaptation to local tissue geometry or surgeon preference. Throughout, the non‑driving hand routinely uses the forceps to evert the opposing edge and to receive the needle tip as it exits. Movements are precise and coordinated, with instrument tips converging over the line approximately one to three centimeters apart. In some frames the operator utilizes a fingertip or small pick to steady tissue while tying—demonstrating comfortable, multi‑modal bimanual control.

Knot management, trimming, and localized adjustments (420–540 s)
At several points the sequence slows to focus on knot formation and suture tail management. The operator brings the driver and the forceps into close opposition at the proximal ends of recently placed stitches, uses the driver to lay down throws, and employs scissors or a second instrument to trim tails. These frames show the surgeon attending to tensioning of each knot to avoid puckering while preserving slight eversion of the skin edges. Tissue approximation improves as the stitches accumulate: gaping diminishes, and the wound edges become consistently apposed with minimal subcutaneous bulging. Occasional changing of instruments—introducing a hemostat or scissors briefly—is captured as the operator finishes individual interrupted stitches.

Brief inconsistencies and continuity of approach (540–620 s)
In the middle portions of the sequence most passes and knot tying continue in the same interrupted fashion. However, a few frames show brief appearances of what looks like a continuous advancement of suture material or a running‑style tensioning maneuver. These moments are short and are interspersed among the clearly interrupted placements and knot‑tying events; they appear more as suture management or partial passes rather than a wholesale switch in closure strategy. Regardless, the operator returns to the interrupted technique and resumes placing and securing individual stitches along the same incision. During these segments, the hands remain tightly coordinated: one hand keeps the adjacent tissue stabilized and everted, while the other manipulates the needle or tightens the knot. At the same time, the non‑operative hand sometimes rearranges suture tails or uses a small gauze pad to protect the needle entry point.

Final passes, preparation of suture material, and localized finishing (620–690 s)
In the later frames the operator prepares additional needle loads, orients the needle with gauze protection in hand, and completes final passes and knot tying at the superior and inferior ends of the wound. Hand positions evolve naturally as closure advances: when accessing the superior portion the hands move proximally and slightly cranially relative to the wound; when finishing at the inferior end they translate distally. Throughout, the primary strategy remains the same—individual, full‑thickness dermal/epidermal bites taken with a curved needle, controlled by a needle driver, and countered with toothed forceps. The operator consistently seeks slight eversion and close edge apposition and ensures each knot lies securely atop the skin surface rather than buried. Final trimming is performed with instrument‑assisted snipping of tails; a hemostat or scissors is used to complete the cut in several close‑up frames.

Instrument relationships and hand dynamics over time
Across the entire procedure the spatial choreography is consistent: the two hands remain in close proximity, typically one to three centimeters apart, flanking the incision. They alternate between driving the needle and stabilizing tissue as the work site migrates along the wound. Instruments occasionally cross over the wound axis; the driver will approach from medial/left or lateral/right depending on which end is being addressed, and the forceps will mirror that approach on the opposite side. When knot tying is imminent both hands converge at the stitch with the forceps often holding the suture tail while the driver loops and tightens throws. Where necessary the left and right hands interchange roles to achieve the best needle angle; these reversals are smooth and do not interrupt the continuity of the closure.

Tissue handling and suture technique fidelity
From start to finish the operator demonstrates deliberate, atraumatic tissue handling: forceps elevation, slight eversion, and small dermal bites are constant goals. Although the needle grip varies from mid‑shaft to nearer the hub across frames, the needle trajectory is planned in each pass to ensure the tip traverses and exits cleanly through the opposite edge. The suture technique is overwhelmingly simple interrupted in character—individual bites are taken, each followed by knotting and trimming—providing predictable edge apposition and eversion. Where occasional brief running or continuous‑appearing maneuvers are observed, they are limited and appear to be used for suture management rather than as a replacement for the interrupted technique.

Final appearance and closure state
By the close of the sequence the incision is uniformly approximated along its length. Multiple evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches hold the epidermal margins in slight eversion, producing a consistently opposed edge with minimal gaping. The knots lie on the surface and have been tensioned to avoid tissue inversion or excessive tension. Suture tails have been trimmed in the vicinity of recently completed knots, and small adjustments were made during tying to maintain alignment. A small residual defect noted early in the inferior region is addressed in the later frames—knot tying and final trimming reduce the gap and bring the skin edges into apposition. The overall closure is neat, with minimal surrounding tissue trauma on the synthetic pad.

Summary of the operative flow
Throughout the video the operator works steadily along the single vertical incision, employing a repeating, reliable sequence: position tissue with fine forceps to create slight eversion, grasp the curved needle with the driver at a comfortable point on the shaft, rotate the needle through one edge and out the other in a controlled arc, pull suture material through, tie a secure series of throws to form a surface knot, and trim the tail. Hands remain in close opposition to manage needle trajectory and suture tension, and the workflow migrates along the wound as each interrupted stitch is placed, secured, and trimmed. Minor variations—grip points, approach angles, and the occasional brief continuous suture appearance—are present but do not alter the principal method. The wound ends the procedure fully approximated with a neat line of everted, well‑aligned skin closures and trimmed suture ends.
