COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single central vertical incision on a synthetic practice pad from start to finish. From the first frames through the end, the operator methodically places and secures a series of simple interrupted skin sutures along that midline wound, progressing in a deliberate top-to-bottom sequence and using consistent instrument technique with small adjustments in hand positioning and knot-advancement methods as the case evolves.

Initial approach and first passes (0–44 s)
At the outset, attention is concentrated on the central vertical slit. The operator positions both hands close to the wound, the needle driver approaching from an oblique/inferior quadrant while toothed forceps or fine pickups stabilize the near edge. A curved, swaged needle is grasped in the driver roughly at mid‑curve rather than exclusively at the tip. The non‑dominant hand elevates and everts the lateral wound edge with forceps while the driver presents the needle across the wound in a controlled arc. Bites are taken superficially through the full thickness of the simulated epidermis/dermis — short, precise passes close to the edge so that the resulting apposition will oppose skin margins without deep tissue capture. As the needle exits, the suture is pulled through and the opposing hand begins to manage the tail, setting up the loop for knotting.

During these early passes the instruments converge tightly over the incision (typically 1–3 cm between tips), with the driver coming from above/right or above/left depending on frame orientation and the pickup/forceps coming from the opposite side. The operator consistently rotates the needle with wrist motion, using the mid‑shaft grip to leverage the curvature of the needle through the synthetic tissue. Slight eversion of the epidermal edge is intentionally produced as the needle exits, reflecting the typical goal of slight outward roll to optimize epidermal edge apposition once the knot is seated.

Building the interrupted row and refining motion (45–119 s)
After the initial stitch, the operator continues placing additional interrupted stitches along the same vertical incision. Hands remain close to the wound; the needle driver frequently approaches from cephalad or the top/right quadrant, while the assisting instrument or fingers hold the suture tail and evert the adjacent edge from below or lateral positions. Needle grips remain consistent — generally at mid‑shaft or proximal to the body — and needle arcs remain short and controlled, advancing from one margin to the opposing margin to capture equivalent bite depths on each side.

Throughout this phase, the operator demonstrates repeatable technique: after passing the needle and pulling the suture through, the free limb is tensioned and manual or instrument-assisted knotting begins. Sometimes knot advancement is achieved with instrument loops and driver‑assisted throws; other times the operator resorts to direct fingertip manipulation to more rapidly seat throws. The non‑dominant hand alternates between fine forceps and bare-finger tensioning, depending on whether the frame shows instrument availability and where along the incision the stitch lies.

Mid-case progression and knot management (120–179 s)
As more stitches accumulate, the central incision shows a visible pattern of previously placed interrupted sutures with short tails. The working zone shifts along the vertical line: the operator moves to superior or inferior segments in a sequential fashion, usually placing a new stitch adjacent to the last completed one. Instrument approaches vary slightly with location — the driver may approach from above/left when placing a superior stitch, from above/right for a central stitch, or from a slight oblique for the inferior segment — but the underlying movements remain the same: mid‑shaft needle grip, rotational passage, and non‑dominant hand control of tissue and tail tension.

Knot tying becomes more visible in these frames. The operator alternates between instrument‑based knot advancement and tying with bare fingers. There are moments where the left hand holds the needle driver over the wound while the right hand directly manipulates the suture tails to form and tighten throws. This mixed approach increases efficiency when multiple stitches are being secured in sequence: quick passes followed by rapid knotting and trimming. Eversion at each stitch is modest and consistent, and the bites remain superficial to mid‑dermal, with no evidence of deep-layer closure or undermining.

Consolidation of technique and addressing previous bites (180–239 s)
Midway through the recording, the central incision is flanked by several completed interrupted stitches. The operator continues to place additional stitches into the unclosed segments, often working superiorly where prior entry points and puncture marks mark the next target. Needle handling remains efficient: the curve is used to sweep through tissue in a tight arc while the opposing forceps stabilizes the far edge and readies the suture for retrieval.

There are some frames showing fine adjustments — the operator manipulates suture tails and occasionally repositions a previously made knot or applies additional tension to seat a throw. In a few moments, minor gapping between adjacent bites is noted; the operator corrects this by tightening subsequent knots and adjusting edge apposition with the forceps. These small corrections do not alter the overall plan; rather, they reflect routine intra‑case adjustments for achieving uniform approximation.

Upper-row completion and efficient knot-tying (240–299 s)
In the upper portion of the incision, the operator places additional interrupted stitches with the same foundational technique. The needle driver hovers over the wound while the non‑dominant hand provides countertraction and tail control. Throughout these frames the working distance remains short — instruments operate within 1–3 cm of one another to maintain fine control of needle direction and suture tension.

As the case moves forward, knot‑advancement technique becomes more varied and refined. The operator uses the needle driver not just to pass the needle but also to grab and advance suture throws, sometimes employing the driver to cinch the knot down while the other hand holds the tail. In later stitches there is a clear tendency toward quicker instrument-based knot completion and trimming of tails with scissor or driver maneuvering, suggesting increased economy of motion as the operator progresses.

Lower segment work, tightening and trimming (300–328 s)
During the final third of the procedure, attention shifts to the lower half of the central incision. The operator places the remaining interrupted stitches in the same manner: mid-shaft needle grip, rotational arc across the wound, capture of superficial dermal tissue, and retrieval/management of the suture limb for knotting. Twice in this period the operator is seen tightening a freshly placed stitch and arranging suture tails, alternating between fingertip manipulation and instrument-mediated knot advancement depending on which provides better control in that moment.

By the later frames, most of the row is in place. The operator inspects and adjusts as required: tightening slightly loose knots, trimming suture tails, and ensuring consistent eversion and close edge apposition. Occasionally, a minor interstitch gap is seen but promptly managed by tightening of the neighboring sutures and repositioning of the forceps during final throws.

Technique consistency and overall pattern
From start to finish the technique is fundamentally consistent: a sequence of simple interrupted skin sutures placed through synthetic epidermal and dermal layers using a curved, swaged needle held in a needle driver at a mid‑to‑proximal shaft position. The needle is rotated through tissue with controlled arcs, each pass capturing superficial full‑thickness skin bites designed to evert the edges slightly. No deep-layer buried sutures, undermining, or subcutaneous closure is performed — the work is squarely focused on epidermal/dermal approximation. Knot securing alternates between instrument‑based advancement and direct manual tying, reflecting flexible, situation‑appropriate strategy rather than a change in overall technique.

Hand positions and spatial relationships over time
Throughout the sequence both hands remain in close coordination and in proximity to the incision. The instrument-bearing hand alternates its approach quadrant (top/right, top/left, or cephalad) depending on which part of the vertical line is being addressed, while the assisting hand alternates between forceps, fingertip control, or direct suture manipulation. Typical separation between tips is small — usually 1–5 cm — allowing precise coordination of needle passage and suture control. As the row of sutures accumulates, the operator occasionally shifts slightly laterally to avoid crowding previously tied knots but consistently returns to a compact working posture to maintain control as subsequent stitches are placed and secured.

Final state of the closure
By the end of the recording the central incision is closed with a continuous pattern of evenly spaced simple interrupted skin sutures. Each stitch reflects similar bite depth and edge eversion, producing consistent approximation along the length of the wound. Knots are seated and tails trimmed in most frames, and the overall wound demonstrates good alignment of epidermal margins with only minimal residual puckering or transient gaps that have been corrected during the tying sequence. The suture technique throughout is efficient and repeatable, combining instrument precision for needle passage with a mixture of instrument-assisted and finger-mediated knot tying to complete secure interrupted closures along the entire central vertical incision.

In summary, the operator executes a focused, methodical closure of a single central midline incision using simple interrupted sutures: small full‑thickness superficial bites taken with a mid‑shaft needle grip, consistent eversion on exit, close instrument coordination within a narrow working field, and a pragmatic mix of instrument and manual knot-advancement techniques that result in a well‑approximated, securely tied closure along the entire wound. Minor variability in bite spacing and occasional slight gaping are actively addressed intra‑procedure, yielding a final line of interrupted sutures that restores continuous skin approximation across the incision.
