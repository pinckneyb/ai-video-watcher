COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The operator spent the entire recorded procedure working along the left-most incision of the practice pad, methodically placing and securing a series of interrupted skin sutures to close the linear defect. From the first frames through the final shots, the left-most linear wound remained the focal point of every instrument motion and stitch placement; other incisions and pre-placed sutures on the pad served only as landmarks while the left wound was systematically closed.

0:00–0:44 — Establishing control and beginning closure
The procedure opens with the left-most of three parallel incisions exposed and ready for repair. The wound is a full‑thickness linear slit about 1.5–2 cm long, edges open but closely opposed. The operator sets up with a long needle driver in the cephalad/upper hand and toothed forceps in the caudal/lower hand. The first needle catch is deliberate: a curved, swaged needle is grasped roughly mid‑shaft so the carrier can control the arc, the tip oriented toward the far edge to take a perpendicular-to-oblique bite. The assistant forceps everts and tents the near margin, presenting dermis for purchase. The needle is driven through a superficial-to-mid‑dermal bite and the suture tail is drawn through, producing a neat loop. Throughout this opening sequence, hands are close to the wound (approximately 1–3 cm separation), with the needle‑driver approaching from above/medial and the forceps counter‑traction from below/lateral—establishing the working geometry that will persist.

45.0–74.0 — Sequential interrupted passage and consistent hand coordination
As the procedure progresses the operator repeats the sequence at adjacent points along the left incision. Hands remain in tight coordination: the dominant hand manipulates the needle driver from above or slightly lateral, frequently regrasping the needle near the body to maintain control of the curvature; the nondominant hand uses toothed or flat Adson‑style forceps to elevate and stabilize the near edge directly opposite the needle entry. Bites are short, controlled arcs through epidermis and dermis that capture full thickness of the simulated skin without deep undermining. The operator consistently orients the needle tip downward toward the pad before passing, producing slight eversion of the wound margins when the suture is drawn taut—an intentional edge profile to promote epidermal approximation once knots are secured.

During this phase there is strong evidence of sequential placement of interrupted stitches: a needle pass, drawing the tail through, and preparation for knot‑tying or repositioning for the next bite. In a short stretch (approximately 60–74 s) there is an appearance of very closely spaced, sequential bites with the suture tail being held and the needle advanced in series. Although this brief pattern resembles a continuous advancement of suture, the overall context—repeated needle withdrawal and visible suture loops and prior tied sutures nearby—indicates the operator is continuing the interrupted approach across the left defect. Any apparent variation here is transient and is followed by resumed interrupted placement.

75.0–119.0 — Refinement of bite depth and stabilization technique
Through the mid portion of the recording the operator maintains an efficient, reproducible technique. Needle grip varies slightly between mid‑shaft and near the tip depending on needed precision, and the driver is used to rotate the curved needle through the arc that best captures dermal tissue while avoiding overly deep bites. The nondominant forceps remains close to the entry point to provide countertraction and to approximate the edges as the needle exits; often the assistant instrument also controls the suture tail so that tension can be maintained as the knot is formed.

Bites are generally superficial to mid‑dermal, producing consistent slight eversion. The operator avoids excessive crush trauma from forceps, though occasional firm grips are used to tent the edge and ensure purchase. Spatially, the needle driver alternates its point of approach—sometimes from directly above, sometimes from the operator’s right or left—while the stabilizing forceps remains immediately adjacent to the wound. This close opposing hand posture (1–3 cm separation in most frames) creates a narrow working corridor that enhances needle trajectory control and tissue approximation.

120.0–179.0 — Continuing sequential interrupted placement; attention to apposition
The operator proceeds along the same left incision with further interrupted passes. In these frames the needle is often grasped at the mid‑curve to give precise control for perpendicular-to-oblique entries. The needle is inserted through the near edge, rotated through the tissue, and retrieved through the far edge with careful attention to equal bite depth on both sides. After each pass the suture is pulled through and held for knot formation. The left hand frequently repositions the tissue slightly to optimize the opposite bite, slightly evert the epidermal margins and hold edges in direct apposition.

There are moments where adjacent, previously tied interrupted sutures lie immediately medial to the working site, and the operator places new stitches lateral or slightly overlapping with even spacing, maintaining a consistent pattern. The positioning of hands evolves to accommodate the line of closure—when working the lateral end of the incision the driver typically approaches from above/medial and the forceps are medial/caudal; when advancing centripetally the approach vectors shift but the relative opposing posture is retained.

180.0–224.0 — Mattress-style tightening and tension control adjacent to interrupted series
Midway through the operation, the operator tightens and adjusts several existing stitches while adding additional passes along the left incision. In these frames there is evidence of mattress-style bites in the vicinity of the interrupted series—tensioning of sutures produces slight eversion as the ties are secured and approximated. The left hand (needle driver) tends to approach from a cranial position, while the forceps come from an inferior-lateral side to provide countertraction. The coordination between needle carrier and tissue stabilizer remains meticulous: one hand advances, the other stabilizes the opposite edge, then both converge to hold tension during knot formation.

At times the operator works very close to prior knots to ensure even spacing and consistent tension across the entire wound. The technique here combines placement of fresh interrupted stitches with finishing maneuvers on prior passes—tightening, adjusting loops, and preparing tails for trimming. Spatially, instruments cross over the wound plane frequently, reflecting the fine motor interplay needed to both pass needles and secure knots within a confined area.

225.0–269.0 — Continued sequential closure with repeated regrasping and controlled passes
The procedure continues in the same methodical fashion: the operator repeats the mid‑shaft to near‑tip grasp adjustments based on the bite being taken, rotates the needle in controlled arcs, and uses the forceps to lift and approximate the skin edges. The superior instrument inserts the needle while the inferior instrument stabilizes and sometimes repositions to optimize the exit site. Bites continue to be shallow‑to‑intermediate through dermis with no evidence of deep tissue undermining.

Hands remain closely opposed (typically 1–3 cm apart) and the needle driver often approaches from above/medial, while the assistive forceps anchor the nearer edge lateral/inferior. Suture tails trail across the pad between passes and are managed either by clamping with a hemostat or by the assistant forceps to maintain consistent tension.

270.0–299.0 — Finishing passes at the lateral end and tightening of settled sutures
As the operator reaches the lateral extent of the left incision, the focus shifts to completing the final interrupted captures and ensuring even tension across the line. The needle driver is used to place at least one additional interrupted stitch at the lateral end of the already clustered series. Multiple previously placed stitches are visibly present and tied; the operator finishes/tightens them and adjusts suture tails.

Techniques remain consistent: perpendicular-to-oblique needle passes, mid‑curve needle grips for stability, and small full‑thickness but superficial-to-mid‑dermal bites that produce slight eversion when tied. The operator’s hands remain in tight coordination with slight shifts in approach angle—sometimes the driver is slightly lateral and cranial, other times more medial—but always converging over the wound for accurate needle retrieval and knot security.

300.0–302.0 — Final adjustments and assessment
In the last brief frames the operator appears to be adjusting and finalizing previously placed interrupted sutures rather than passing a new needle. The right hand holds a needle‑holder type instrument above the left incision, while the left hand holds scissors or a second instrument in standby. There is minimal direct tissue penetration at this stage; activity is limited to adjusting loop tension and preparing for trimming. Details such as exact knot throws and precise needle tip position are not clearly visible in these frames, which limits precise description of the final knot‑tying technique. Nevertheless, the wound edges remain well opposed under the influence of multiple secured interrupted sutures.

Overall technique and evolution
From start to finish the operator adheres to a consistent interrupted suturing approach along the left-most incision. Needle handling is deliberate and methodical: the curved needle is generally grasped near the mid‑shaft (occasionally nearer the tip when precision dictates), oriented perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin to allow controlled passage, and rotated through tissue in short arcs. The nondominant hand consistently provides countertraction—lifting or tenting the near edge with toothed or Adson‑style forceps to expose dermis for purchase and maintain alignment as the needle exits the far edge.

Bite depth is mostly superficial to mid‑dermal, producing predictable, slight eversion when the suture is tightened—an intended effect to achieve epidermal edge inversion upon final scar maturation. Suture placement is sequential and evenly spaced along the incision; the operator places new interrupted stitches adjacent to existing knots, frequently tightening previous sutures before adding the next to ensure even tension distribution.

Hand position evolution is subtle rather than dramatic. Early frames show the needle driver generally above and lateral to the incision with forceps below; later frames show small shifts (approaching from 11–12 o’clock, or from the operator’s right or left) to gain optimal angles for later passes along the line, but the fundamental opposing‑hand geometry remains constant. This close, coordinated positioning—typically within 1–4 cm separation—permits precise needle trajectory control, safe retrieval, and stable knot formation in a confined working corridor.

Technique consistency and minor deviations
The suturing pattern remains essentially uniform throughout the recording: controlled single‑bite interrupted sutures placed sequentially to close the left wound. One short interval exhibited a pattern resembling continuous advancement of the suture, with repeated sequential bites while the suture tail was held taut; however, the dominant behavior across the entire procedure consists of single passes with individual tightening and knot security, so the overall technique is best characterized as interrupted suturing. A minor limitation is that in the final frames the needle tip and exact knot morphology are not clearly visible, which constrains confirmation of the final knot‑tying method and tail trimming; despite this, tissue apposition and suture placement indicate secure interrupted closure.

Final state of closure
By the end of the recording the left-most incision is closed with a series of evenly spaced interrupted sutures that bring dermal and epidermal margins into close apposition with slight eversion—consistent with good superficial edge alignment. Multiple tied sutures lie along the wound’s length, with freshly placed stitches at the lateral end finalized and prior knots tightened as needed. The synthetic pad shows no active bleeding (expected), minimal crush injury from forceps, and no evidence of undermined tissue. The operator’s final maneuvers focus on adjusting tension and preparing to trim tails, leaving the wound cleanly approximated and secure.

In summary, the procedure is a focused, stepwise repair of a single left‑sided linear incision using repetitive, controlled interrupted suturing. Needle handling, tissue stabilization, bite depth, and hand coordination are consistent throughout, resulting in a well‑approximated closure with minor visual limitations in the final frames that prevent exact characterization of the final knot morphology and tail management.
