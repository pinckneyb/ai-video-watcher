COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The scene opens on a synthetic skin pad with four parallel, horizontal slits. Throughout the sequence the operator works on the uppermost slit—the short linear wound just below the superior edge of the pad—using a curved needle on a suture and the familiar trio of needle driver, Adson forceps, and scissors. The flow of work follows a continuous closure plan: secure an initial anchor at one end of the top slit, then advance with a series of closely spaced, symmetric bites that approximate the edges while maintaining gentle eversion, and finally secure and trim at the opposite end. Along the way, there are brief interludes of instrument ties and resets, and one brief aside to place a practice stitch on a separate, small superior cut. The main storyline, however, is a single, continuous closure of the uppermost horizontal wound.

The closure begins at the left end of the top slit. The wound is short with clean, slightly gaping edges. The operator sets up with a needle driver in one hand and tissue forceps in the other, keeping both instruments aligned parallel to the wound and working within a few millimeters of the left terminus. The curved needle is consistently grasped around the proximal third of its curve, giving good control over the arc. The driver is kept nearly perpendicular to the skin at entry, and the forceps are used to gently lift and evert the near wound edge without crushing tissue. A well-controlled forehand rotation of the wrist brings the needle tip through the epidermal/dermal margin and across to the far lip, exiting at a matching depth and distance from the edge. The suture is drawn through smoothly. This first bite establishes secure purchase at the left end; the instruments remain close to the tissue, and there is minimal crossing of hands. The forceps intermittently assist in retrieving the needle tip and presenting the far edge, but their primary role is precise edge eversion and stabilization.

With that first pass in place, attention shifts from driving the needle to securing the initial anchor. The operator performs an instrument tie at the left end. The needle driver holds the standing end while the opposite hand manipulates the free strand, alternately forming loops and transferring the short end into the driver’s jaws. Multiple throws are executed—neatly alternated to square the knot—and the tension is modulated to seat the knot directly over the edge without overt compression. In some sequences the forceps are briefly put down and a second needle holder is used to speed the instrument tie, and at one point a hemostat/driver is parked at the upper-left of the field to hold the strand as a post. Throughout, the driver remains lateral-left to the wound, pulling laterally to maintain tension while the other hand forms and advances throws. The needle itself remains parked in the driver, oriented perpendicular to the incision, serving primarily as a handle during knot construction. Successive frames show similar maneuvers: hand ties directly over the left end, instrument ties alternating hands, and deliberate seating and dressing of the knot to coapt the margins. When the anchor is judged secure, there is a clean trim of the tail with scissors; cutting occurs just lateral to the left end, a centimeter or two off the wound edge, with the driver stabilizing the knot area while the scissors advance to trim.

With the left-side anchor completed, the operator turns to running the line along the slit. The needle is reloaded at the proximal third of the curve, the driver approaches from above the wound, and the forceps are reintroduced to present the tissue. The hand choreography is consistent: the driver in the dominant hand performs a controlled arc, entering the near edge at 90 degrees and following the needle’s curvature; the forceps, held in the opposite hand, gently lift the near edge to improve the entry angle, then move to the far edge to receive the needle tip and to keep the exit point symmetric with the entry. In some passes the forceps grasp the needle tip to help pull it through cleanly. The bites are small, shallow, and even—just into the dermis—and they fall very close to the wound margin. The result is a line that brings the edges together with slight eversion. Slack is managed as the needle comes through; the operator is careful to draw the strand down so it lays along the incision line rather than standing proud. The suture is often kept trailing superiorly to the right to clear the view of the next target zone.

As the run advances, the operator occasionally pauses to reload the needle to maintain the ideal entry angle, keeping the curve aligned to cross the slit efficiently. The driver tip remains just superior to the wound; the forceps oppose it across the slit. Bead-by-bead, the stitch progresses left to right across the top incision. Passes placed through the center show smooth motion: a forehand bite through the right edge, traverse the gap, and precise exit on the left edge; then a re-load and the reverse to continue. The bites remain shallow and symmetrical, consistent with an intradermal plane that favors cosmetic apposition with gentle edge eversion. In places where forceps are not used, eversion is maintained by the combination of perpendicular needle entry and careful tensioning of the strand as each loop is seated.

The operator’s technique remains largely consistent: controlled 90-degree entry, small symmetric dermal bites, and attention to edge eversion. Occasionally, the left hand is momentarily off-screen while pulling through slack; at other times, the left hand is fully engaged with Adson forceps to present tissue, then switches tools briefly to assist with needle reloading. The driver works with minimal hand crossing; the instruments are aligned nearly parallel to the wound, with only a few millimeters of separation between tips during each bite to maximize control.

At intervals during this progression, the suturer briefly secures the line before continuing—an understandable tactic in a training context to ensure the work holds while the next segment is set up. In one sequence through the central third, a stitch is passed across and then immediately secured with an instrument tie: the left hand takes up the free strand; loops are formed and a knot is seated. In another, forceps stabilize the right lip while the driver captures the suture near the swage to tighten and dress a previously laid loop, forming successive throws to lock the approximation at that point. These checkpoints result in localized fixation without affecting the overall plan to run the suture across the length of the slit. Where a tie is placed midline, it is done efficiently with the same attention to squaring the knot and keeping the throw seated directly over the wound, again without crushing tissue. That said, this intermittent “secure and continue” behavior departs from the most streamlined version of a continuous closure; it functions here as a reinforcement step in a practice scenario rather than a change in the overarching method.

As the run enters the right half of the wound, control remains crisp. The right hand (now often holding the needle driver) approaches from the superior-right corner, aligning the needle perpendicular to the skin. The left hand’s Adsons evenly evert the near right edge to present an ideal entry site. Several sequences show the needle being positioned, then driven through at the right end: the driver repositions to retrieve the needle after passage, the forceps stabilize and elevate the edge, and the suture is drawn down smoothly with the free end managed inferiorly and anteriorly to keep the field clear. Bites taken at the right end are again shallow and matched side-to-side, consistent with an intradermal/superficial technique. At times the suture strand exits superior to the slit and is intentionally held in that orientation to control tension while setting the stitch.

The suturer continues to work along the right third, laying the last few bites with deliberate forehand arcs. The driver remains just superior to the incision, with brief elevation of the edge by forceps to expose the entry site. Occasionally, after a pass is completed and the suture is pulled through, the driver is set aside momentarily while both hands manage the strand to regulate tension and lay the loop neatly along the incision line. In several right-sided sequences, the needle is reloaded and the driver realigns to preserve a 90-degree entry angle, while the left hand’s forceps are used in a delicate, non-crushing manner to stabilize the edges immediately adjacent to the intended bite. All the while, the operator maintains a habit of laying the trailing suture toward the superior-right corner to avoid crossing over the wound.

Near the right terminus of the slit, the line is prepared for its final fixation. The needle driver stays over the right end; the assisting hand alternates between forceps and scissors. A final securing step is constructed: a loop is formed and tightened, and an anchoring throw is seated over a small bite taken in the superficial dermis just at or slightly off the right wound edge. This anchor secures the run at its terminal end. With the knot seated, scissors cross into the field, and the excess tail is trimmed flush to leave a neat finish. The right-hand driver stabilizes the knot area during trimming to maintain accuracy and avoid over-cutting. At other moments around this endpoint, the operator is seen positioning the needle for yet another right-sided pass, angling the tip toward the near skin edge and gently elevating the tissue to expose the entry site; in one sequence a pass is placed and the hands withdraw, leaving the stitch set without immediately showing a final knot in that particular segment. Taken together, these scenes depict the sequence of finishing bites and terminal securing maneuvers that close the run at the right corner.

Throughout the entire process, spatial relationships remain consistent and deliberate:

- The needle is almost always grasped at the proximal third of the curve, an orientation that allows a controlled, circular motion through tissue rather than a straight push.
- Entry is perpendicular to the skin, and the needle’s path follows its curvature, minimizing tearing and maximizing precision of depth.
- Forceps are used with a gentle, atraumatic pinch, primarily to evert and stabilize the edge, and intermittently to receive the needle tip. There is no crushing or undermining; handling is limited to the dermis and immediate wound margin.
- Hands and instruments are aligned parallel to the wound; crossing is minimized to preserve a clean field and predictable motion arcs.
- The free strand is managed conscientiously: alternately parked, tensioned, or clamped as a post; kept out of the way by trailing superiorly or lateral to the wound; and carefully drawn down to lay the loops flat along the wound line.

There is one brief aside where a stitch is placed across a small, separate superior vertical or obliquely oriented corner cut near the upper-left border of the pad. The same technique principles are employed—perpendicular entry, gentle edge control with forceps, and a controlled pass—followed by an instrument tie to secure that isolated bite. This interlude functions as a quick practice of the same motions on a different orientation and does not alter the continuity of the closure on the main, uppermost horizontal wound.

By the time the right side work is complete, the top slit exhibits a consistent, well-approximated closure. Along its length, the bites are symmetric and closely spaced, favoring the dermis with minimal tissue trauma. The edges are gently everted, a sign of precise needle angle and respectful handling with the Adsons. The line itself lies flat and neat along the incision; loops are evenly tensioned without strangulation, and any knots placed—whether the initial left-end anchor, intermediate reinforcement throws used in a training context, or the terminal right-end securing knot—are seated directly over the wound margins where they contribute to apposition rather than distortion. Tail(s) have been trimmed where shown, and the instruments are set aside.

In summary, the operation is a methodical continuous closure of the uppermost horizontal slit on the pad. It starts with a left-sided anchor built with careful instrument ties; proceeds across the wound with a series of precise, perpendicular dermal bites that are small, shallow, and symmetric, using forceps to evert and steady the edges; includes occasional reinforcement steps to secure progress while preparing subsequent passes; and finishes at the right end with terminal securing and tail trimming. Hand position evolves as needed—right-hand driver with left-hand forceps for most passes; occasional switches when tying or reloading; and careful suture management to keep the field clear—yet remains steadfastly aligned with the wound’s axis. Despite brief deviations for practice on a small superior cut and occasional midline securing steps not strictly necessary for a continuous closure, the overall technique is consistent with a running, cosmetically minded skin approximation from left to right, culminating in a well-seated, cleanly dressed closure of the top incision.
