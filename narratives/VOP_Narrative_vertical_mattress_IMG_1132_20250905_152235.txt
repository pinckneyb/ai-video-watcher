COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a clean, deliberate setup of hands, instruments, and tissue orientation that sets the tone for the rest of the procedure. The right hand works consistently with a needle driver, entering from the patient’s right/superior side; the left hand uses Adson forceps from the left/inferior side to present and evert skin edges. On the rightmost incision, the first bite is initiated with the needle loaded at the proximal-to-mid third and oriented perpendicular to the surface. The left forceps lightly evert the near edge while the right hand follows the needle’s curvature in a controlled pronation–supination motion, establishing the pattern of precise, 90-degree entries and gentle tissue handling that continues throughout.

The surgeon then transitions across the pad to rehearse the same fundamentals on the other slits. Both hands briefly leave the field to let the suture settle flat; the right returns to reload the needle cleanly with the curve preserved, while the left forceps reapproach the wound edge to present tissue. On the leftmost incision, the left hand helps guide the exiting needle tip, the right driver releases momentarily, and the left completes the pull-through. The right hand then regrips the needle at the correct point on the curve, reorients it perpendicular to the pad, and aims toward the next target—establishing a rhythm of pass, pull-through, and reload that keeps the field organized and the suture free of tangles.

Moving to the central incision, the surgeon tidies an existing loop at the wound apex and clears the field by lifting the needle and long limb out of the way. The needle is reloaded at the proximal third, perpendicular, and the tip is brought to the right wound edge near the lower apex. The hands work in a crossed configuration at times, but spacing is maintained, with the forceps stabilizing the margin and the driver advancing with precision. The suture management is deliberate: the long limb is kept superior-left and the short tail is held at the apex to prevent entanglement.

With the next stitch prepared, the video shifts into knot-tying sequences. The needle is “parked” safely at the periphery while the right-hand needle driver becomes the tying instrument. The left hand manages the free end, forming loops over the driver. The first throw is passed by rotating through the loop to grasp the short tag near the wound, drawing it through, and applying opposing tension to seat the throw directly over the midline. A reverse wrap follows, squaring the knot without torquing the tissue. This cycle—form, retrieve, and seat with balanced, opposed traction—repeats in a smooth cadence that keeps the knot flat and centered. Scissors then enter from the right to trim tails while the left hand holds the knot steady, after which the right hand immediately resumes as the needle driver and the left hand switches back to tissue forceps to set up the next pass.

Now working steadily on the central incision, the right hand drives a right-to-left bite with the needle oriented perpendicular to the wound. The left forceps assist the exit and then lift the opposite edge to set up the reciprocal pass, preparing a simple interrupted stitch. The suture is pulled through with a measured tail left on the entry side, and the needle is reloaded with its curvature preserved for the counter-bite. When needed, the left hand pauses forceps use to manage suture with the fingers or to hand the needle back to the driver, emphasizing clean transfers and an uncluttered field.

At the point of extraction and tie, the left forceps transition from tissue control to managing the short tail, while the right driver pulls the long limb into position for an instrument tie. The first throw is often a double wrap to lock initial tension; throws are then alternated to square the knot. The knot is consistently seated at the point of approximation with traction applied in opposite directions and without crushing the dermis. After the knot is secured, scissors trim the tails under controlled elevation of the suture line to avoid nicking the skin.

The flow settles into an efficient cycle around the central slit: the right hand loads the needle at the proximal-to-mid third, the left hand everts an edge, the needle is driven through on a short, controlled arc, and the tip is captured and re-grasped as needed for the next bite. The suture is drawn through while maintaining an intentional short tail and a clear long limb, which is kept lateral to avoid prior knots. When both instruments briefly leave the frame, it’s to pull the suture fully through or to reorient for the next pass without crowding. The driver and forceps meet and separate over the wound with consistent spacing, crossing only when necessary and never obscuring the bite path.

As the central series continues, the surgeon demonstrates the full pass of a simple interrupted stitch—outside-in on the right edge with careful eversion, inside-out on the left—and leaves a generous loop for tying. The needle is released and regrasped on the proximal third with the curve ready for the next entry. Forceps intermittently elevate the dermal margin to guide the needle and protect the edge. The suture is then pulled through, slack is removed, and tying resumes with instrument throws, the knot flattened and seated midway.

Near the end, the operator trims central knot tails, then reloads the needle and positions it toward the right-sided incision for a subsequent stitch. A final tying sequence highlights two-instrument technique: with a needle driver in each hand, the right-hand driver forms the loop, the left-hand driver advances to capture the short end, and the throws are alternated to square the knot. Tension is applied in opposite directions across the midline to set the knot flush over the center of the incision. The needle, parked on the right edge during tying, remains controlled and out of the bite path. The sequence concludes with the knot seated neatly, instruments withdrawing, and the field stable—skin edges approximated, suture tails trimmed, and the suture line organized for whatever stitch would come next.

Throughout, the technique evolves from careful setup and deliberate bite placement to a confident, efficient rhythm of pass, pull-through, reload, tie, and trim. The right hand maintains consistent control of the needle driver, the left alternates between tissue forceps, suture management, and a second driver as needed, and the surgeon’s movements emphasize perpendicular entries, following the needle’s curve, gentle eversion without crushing, and square knots seated precisely at the midline. The result is a coherent demonstration of interrupted skin suturing with disciplined suture handling and clean, methodical instrument choreography.
