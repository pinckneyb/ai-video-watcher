COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The case proceeds as a focused repair of the long superior horizontal slit near the top center of the foam skin pad. From the outset the operator orients to that top-center incision and treats it as the working line; while the model contains multiple small test wounds and several pre-placed interrupted stitches below or adjacent to the slit, the clinician’s attention remains on closing the long, superficial full‑length incision using a single continuous suture strand. The work is done using standard microsurgical technique on a synthetic dermal model: curved atraumatic needles, a metal needle driver/curved hemostat used as the driver, fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson-style) to grasp and evert edges, occasional scissors/hemostats for cutting/manipulation, and the dominant hand primarily driving the needle.

Initial approach and setup
At the start the operator establishes a stable working posture with both hands gloved and the forearms frequently braced on the table. The top-center incision is identified visually and approximated by eye where possible; a drawn alignment line on the pad is occasionally used as a guide for successive bites. The nondominant hand repeatedly takes up tissue forceps to grasp and tent the near wound edge, providing precise countertraction and slight eversion, while the dominant hand grips a curved, swaged needle in a needle driver. Throughout the procedure the needle is commonly grasped near the mid-shaft or roughly one‑third to two‑thirds from the swage, permitting controlled rotational driving of the curved arc through the synthetic dermis rather than an overly distal, unstable grip. The tip orientation is continually adjusted—presented into the tissue, then rotated and pulled through in a smooth arc.

First passes and establishing the running line
Early frames show the needle being presented and passed through the superior wound edge, often with the right-hand driver advancing the needle from a lateral-inferior approach while the left-hand forceps lifts and stabilizes the opposite margin. Bites are deliberately superficial — epidermal to mid-dermal equivalents on the model — and are taken close to the wound edge to bring skin margins into apposition without deep tissue purchase. The clinician forms the initial anchor by passing the needle and pulling the suture through; the suture tail is intentionally left long enough to manage tension while subsequent passes are made. Where the needle exits, the forceps receive and sometimes transfer control of the needle for repositioning. The operator routinely regrips the needle as necessary, shifting the driver hold along the shaft to maintain an optimal mechanical arc as the needle tip traverses tissue.

Transition to continuous advancement: coordinated hand roles
Very quickly the repair adopts a continuous (running) technique. The dominant right hand consistently functions as the needle driver, rotating short controlled arcs to shuttle the needle from one wound margin to the other; the left hand alternates between tissue forceps to present and tent the next edge and suture management (receiving the needle, controlling the trailing filament, or preparing for the next pass). Spatially, the needle driver often operates from the right or inferior-lateral side of the incision while the forceps approach from the left or superior-anterior side. Hands cross over the pad intermittently with instrument shafts overlapping above the wound; the suture line itself is draped between the hands, sometimes looping toward the lower-right quadrant of the work field while the clinician advances the line left-to-right or right-to-left depending on the current pass.

Needle technique details and bite quality
Across frames the needle is repeatedly grasped near the body of the curve rather than at the very tip, allowing for a controlled, curved driving motion. The operator performs each pass with a precise brief rotation of the wrist, steering the needle arc through the superficial dermal layer and retrieving it with forceps where necessary. Bites are kept evenly spaced and relatively shallow; the clinician uses the forceps to tent the skin and ensure the epidermal margins are aligned before the needle transfixes tissue. There is an emphasis on atraumatic handling: fine toothed forceps are used to present tissue, and grips are gentle, producing minimal crush artifact on the synthetic pad. Eversion is modest — the edges are opposed and slightly everted to promote epidermal approximation, but the technician avoids excessive inversion or gaping.

Mid‑procedure management: regrips, suture control and tensioning
As the continuous suture traverses the incision, the operator frequently repositions their grip on the needle to maintain optimal mechanical advantage, especially when the needle curvature is partially used up or when a tight corner of the incision requires a different approach angle. The non‑dominant hand remains active in suture management: tensioning the trailing filament, feeding slack, forming the next loop, or briefly holding the suture tail while the driver reorients. On some passes, the left hand rests an index finger across the line to help stabilize the pad and provide tactile feedback, a technique used intermittently throughout the procedure. Occasionally the operator momentarily withdraws the needle entirely from tissue to reposition the suture line or to clear the field with gauze, then smoothly re-introduces it to continue the continuous pattern.

Progression along the incision and lateral movement
The running line is advanced sequentially from one end of the slit toward the other. At times the operator works from the right toward the left; in other sequences the needle is driven right-to-left depending on which portion of the incision requires the next bite. Where previous interrupted sutures exist inferior to the working site, they serve as visual landmarks and do not interrupt the running pattern; they are left intact and the continuous strand is carefully nested a short distance superior to them. As the clinician progresses, the bites remain consistent in spacing and depth, creating a uniform line with no large gaps. Even when small adjustments are required at the lateral endpoints of the incision, the clinician uses short, controlled passes and regrips rather than making deep or wide bites.

Instrument choreography and hand position evolution
Hand positions evolve subtly but predictably. Early on both hands sit close to the incision — within a few centimeters — with the needle driver often approaching obliquely and the forceps presenting tissue directly opposite. As the repair proceeds laterally, the needle driver migrates along the incision, sometimes working from the superior/rear of the pad as the operator angles the needle into the next bite. The left hand alternates between a stabilizing role (lifting and everting the near edge) and an active role in suture management (tensioning loops, receiving the needle). At several points the driver-hand graces the needle more proximally or more distally to change arc dynamics; the receiving forceps briefly become the dominant instrument for retrieval. Throughout, instrument shafts cross above the pad in a coordinated fashion, and the suture tail is periodically repositioned to avoid entanglement.

Handling of transitions and occasional pauses
There are several brief moments where the needle is partially withdrawn from tissue and repositioned — these correspond to micro-adjustments in grip or changes in trajectory. The clinician uses these pauses to smooth the suture line, tension previous bites, or prepare for knotting at an intermediate anchor point. While other small incisions on the pad sometimes appear with interrupted sutures being placed or previously present, those are background and do not become the focus; the continuous repair of the superior slit continues to be advanced. In one segment toward the latter half of the sequence, the operator draws the suture through to form a loop and prepares to secure an anchoring knot; scissors and hemostats are introduced transiently for tail trimming and to assist in knot management.

Technique consistency and refinement
Throughout the operation the technique remains consistent: curved-needle driving with a needle driver in the dominant hand, forceps in the non‑dominant hand for tissue presentation and suture control, shallow dermal bites, modest eversion, and even spacing. The operator demonstrates refinement over time — regrips are economical, wrist arcs are compact and efficient, and the thread is tensioned with controlled, distributed force rather than abrupt pulls. The clinician avoids deep layering or undermining; instead, the closure relies on accurate epidermal approximation. When the needle must be transferred between instruments, the exchange is smooth and does not interrupt the continuity of the suture line.

Final passes, securing and completion
As the needle reaches the terminal lateral portion of the incision, the operator makes the final passes with deliberate caution to match the bite depth and spacing of the preceding stitches. The suture is drawn through and an external loop created for securing. The nondominant hand helps to align the edges precisely while the dominant hand prepares to tie. A knot is formed (visible as suture tails are manipulated and drawn), tension is adjusted to maintain slight eversion and even tissue apposition, and excess suture is trimmed with scissors. In the concluding frames the driver and forceps are withdrawn, instruments cross above the pad one last time, and the suture strand rests along the top of the slit.

Wound-edge result and final state
The repaired superior incision presents as a continuous line of evenly approximated epidermal edges with mild, intentional eversion. The stitches lie at a consistent superficial depth, distributing closure tension across the length of the slit. No deep or layered suturing was required; the repair relies on superficial dermal purchase to appose skin edges. Final inspection shows the suture line secured, the suture tails managed and shortened, and instruments withdrawn from the immediate field. Minimal puckering is present at previously tied segments inferiorly, but along the repaired top slit the edges are smooth and well aligned.

Notes on context and limitations
Throughout the video, multiple small incisions and existing interrupted sutures are visible on the pad; however, they serve only as surrounding context. The procedural narrative focuses on the top-center horizontal slit and its systematic closure using a single continuous suture strand. Certain frames partially obscure exact needle tip depth or precise hand micro-movements due to instrument overlap and gloved hands in the field; nevertheless, the overall technique—curved-needle continuous running closure with controlled mid-shaft needle grips, atraumatic tissue handling, coordinated two-handed work, and final knot securing and trimming—is clearly demonstrated from initial pass through to completion.

In summary, the clinician methodically converts the open superior horizontal incision into a neat, continuous closure: precise curved-needle passes, predictable hand choreography with the needle driver primarily in the dominant hand and forceps presenting tissue in the nondominant hand, consistent superficial bite depth with slight eversion, efficient suture management and regrips, and orderly securing and trimming of the suture at the end of the line. The incision is left approximated and ready for whatever next steps the training scenario requires.
