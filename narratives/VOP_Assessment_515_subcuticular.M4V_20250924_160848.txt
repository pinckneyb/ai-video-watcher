COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure concentrates on the lowermost horizontal slit of the practice pad, the short straight incision positioned just above the yellow inferior border. Across the recording the operator repeatedly returns to and advances closure along this single wound, placing successive passes, tensioning and ultimately securing the repair. Instruments and hands remain tightly focused over this line for nearly the whole video; other parallel slits are left alone except for one brief, noted deviation early in the sequence.

Initial placement and setup (0.0–14.0 s)
At the outset a new bite is planned and executed on the lower slit. The operator positions the curved needle in the driver (proximal third grasp), orienting it orthogonal to the wound line. A forceps in the opposite hand lifts and everts the dermal edge to present tissue for a controlled arc. The needle is driven through one margin and then through the opposite side of the incision, following a wrist-driven curve rather than a straight push. The suture is pulled through, leaving a tail for eventual tying; the needle is re-grasped to set up the next pass. Throughout this early pass the hands straddle the wound in opposing positions—one instrument slightly distal and the other superior—maintaining a few millimeters working distance centered over the same slit.

Brief discrepancy (15.0–29.0 s)
A short interval shows activity at the second-from-bottom horizontal incision rather than the lowermost line. In these frames a bite is placed across that line using the same basic technique—driver presenting the needle and forceps everting the edge—advancing the stitch line on the nearby cut. This constitutes an inconsistency with the otherwise continuous attention to the lowermost wound. The remainder of the recording resumes exclusive work on the bottom-most incision; the brief shift will be noted as a deviation but does not change the overall pattern of closure focused on the lowest slit.

Progressive placement of interrupted passes (30.0–104.0 s)
After the initial passes the operator alternates brief withdrawals to reload the needle and then returns to the lower incision to continue placing additional bites. The needle is repeatedly grasped at roughly the proximal-to-middle third and oriented close to 90 degrees to the skin to create symmetric, perpendicular entry/exit points. Forceps are used intermittently to evert and stabilize the receiving edge while the driver advances the needle through the opposing lip. Each pass is drawn through, the suture strands are tensioned to approximate the margins, and the driver is reloaded for the next bite. During these stages the hands maintain a consistent spatial relationship relative to the wound: the driver operates from one side of the line while the forceps/pulling hand opposes it on the contralateral side, converging toward the center during needle passage and then moving laterally to manage the slack. There is repeated, gentle control of tissue edges—no heavy crushing is observed—and the suture tail is kept lateral to the field to avoid tangling around the other, unused slits.

Building the line from left toward right (75.0–179.0 s)
A pattern of sequential stitch placement becomes evident: the operator advances from the left/central region of the lower incision toward its right terminus. Multiple frames show new bites being initiated at the left end or left-to-mid portion of the wound, with the needle passing from the far edge to the near edge in a controlled, wrist-driven arc. Opposing forceps take a precise lift and evert the receiving edge, and the driver pronates/supinates as needed to follow the curvature and exit at symmetrical depth. After each passage the suture is drawn through and tensioned; the operator repositions and reloads the needle for the next bite. This staged progression—left, center, then toward the right—is repeated across several cycles, establishing a continuous series of interrupted stitches along the same line.

Midline technique details and hand coordination (120.0–224.0 s)
Throughout the mid-portion of the case the surgeon demonstrates consistent technical elements: the needle is nearly always regrasped around the proximal-to-middle third of the curve to maintain control and allow a perpendicular approach. The opposing hand either uses forceps to evert the edge or momentarily manages the free suture limb, depending on whether the pass or knot-tying phase is underway. When forceps are used they provide gentle countertraction and precise presentation of dermis at the entry point; the driver advances the needle through a smooth arc and, where needed, the assistant forceps or a second instrument captures the needle tip to complete the pass and pull it through. At intervals the operator withdraws both hands to reload or exchange instruments, then resumes work directly over the same incision.

Rightward extension and repeated passes (225.0–299.0 s)
As the sequence continues the work shifts to the right half and terminus of the lower incision. The operator takes new bites near the wound’s right end: the driver remains centered or slightly superior-left of the bite line while forceps approach from the right to evert and present tissue. The needle passes are consistent with prior technique—orthogonal approach, controlled wrist arc, capture of the needle by the opposing instrument to facilitate withdrawal. After passage, the suture is drawn through to create looped bridges across the wound; the long end is repeatedly kept lateral to the operative area. In some frames the right hand transitions to scissors to trim suture tails following knot completion, indicating a rhythm of placement followed by securing and managing individual stitches as the line matures toward closure.

Securing sutures: knot-tying and instrument throws (300.0–329.0 s and 315.0–329.0 s)
Following a series of passes, the operator begins the process of securing earlier stitches. The needle driver is used not only to manipulate the needle but also to act as the post for instrument ties. Wraps are formed around the jaws of the driver and the free, short end is grasped to complete each throw. Throughout knot formation the needle is often kept proximal to the jaws and angled away from the wound so it does not interfere with tying. One hand maintains lateral tension on the free limb while the other alternates forming throws and pulling the knot down. These frames show multiple instrument throws to square and lock each knot—each tightening step carefully approximates the edges without over-tensioning—until the stitch sits neatly on the skin surface. During this phase, no new bites are being placed; instead, knots are sequentially seated and inspected.

Final knots, trimming and tail management (330.0–359.0 s; 345.0–359.0 s)
After knotting is underway, both hands come together over the right end of the wound to finalize locking and trimming. A hemostat or second driver is used at times to control the free limb while the primary driver maintains tension on the knot. The operator then introduces straight scissors to trim the tails close to the knot while preserving adequate tail length for security. This coordinated sequence—stabilize, square, cut—is repeated until the stitches along the right half and terminus are secured. Throughout trimming, hands remain adjacent to the same wound segment with instruments positioned to avoid nicking the approximated edges.

Final instrument exchanges and finishing gestures (360.0–372.0 s)
The closing frames show instrument exchange and management rather than additional tissue bites. Forceps and drivers are set down or swapped; scissors are used briefly to trim or clear slack; at the end both hands move away from the field. The suture strands are kept separated and clear of the other slits on the pad; knots lie centered over the incision with edges approximated by tension. There is a final check of tissue apposition and a last trimming of excess material.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships over time
From beginning to end the hands and instruments remain tightly coupled to the same wound line. Early on the needle driver and forceps consistently oppose one another across the incision, the driver approaching at roughly a right angle and the forceps presenting the receiving edge. Roles occasionally alternate—either hand may hold the driver or forceps depending on the pass or the need to tie—but the pattern of opposing instrument positioning never departs: one instrument superior or lateral to the bite, the other inferior or lateral on the opposite side. During needle passage the hands converge toward the midline and then separate laterally as the suture is tensioned. During knot-tying the driver is held over the center of the wound and the free limb is kept to the side to allow unobstructed wrapping. Scissors and secondary instruments are introduced at the rightmost end when tails are trimmed.

Consistency and technical refinement
Technique throughout the video is remarkably consistent. Needle orientation is repeatedly perpendicular to the wound line; needle grasp point remains roughly proximal to middle third for controlled curvature; forceps are used selectively to evert and stabilize; passes are made at symmetric depth across the dermis. The operator demonstrates a clear, repeatable workflow: place a bite, draw the suture through, reload the needle, advance to the next bite, and periodically secure prior stitches with instrument-tied knots. Tensioning across the wound is measured—edges are approximated with gentle eversion and without excessive tissue crushing. Over time the operator’s motions become compact and economical: fewer large repositionings, more immediate reloading and return to the same site, culminating in an efficient knot-tying and trimming phase.

Noted deficiency and reconciliation
A single short deviation was observed early in the recording where activity focused briefly on the second-from-bottom incision. Except for that interval, all subsequent frames document continuous attention to the lowermost horizontal incision. The remainder of the case consistently follows the same repair strategy on the bottom slit, so the deviation is treated as an outlier in an otherwise continuous closure sequence.

Final state of closure
By the end of the recording the lowermost incision is approximated along its length with sequential interrupted stitches that have been tied, squared and had their tails trimmed. The wound edges lie gently everted and coapted; knots are centered over the incision and appear securely seated. Instrument placement is away from other slits, and suture strands have been managed to avoid entanglement. Hands withdraw after final trimming and verification of approximation, leaving a neatly secured repair along the lower horizontal cut.

Summary
Throughout the procedure the operator methodically advances a line of interrupted sutures across the lower horizontal incision, using controlled, orthogonal needle entry, forceps-assisted eversion, repeated reloading of the needle for serial passes, and instrument-tied knots to secure and trim each stitch. Hand positions and instrument roles are consistent and coordinated, with small role alternations as needed for tying and cutting. The repair progresses from initial bites through successive placement toward the right terminus, followed by secure knotting and trimming, producing a well-approximated, neatly finished closure along the targeted incision.
