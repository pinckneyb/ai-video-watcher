COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The field is a silicone skin pad secured at the corners, with several pre-existing incisions. The central midline already bears multiple completed stitches and is not manipulated at any point; all active work is confined to the leftmost vertical wound along the pad’s left border. That slit begins the sequence fully open with clean, straight edges and no knots on it.

The procedure opens at the inferior end of this left vertical incision. The right hand carries a needle driver and presents a curved needle that is loaded in a standard position—about the proximal third to mid-shaft, roughly two-thirds of the distance from the tip—so that the needle can be driven in an arc perpendicular to the skin surface. The left hand uses forceps to lift and evert the near (left) wound edge, then briefly alternates to the far edge to present tissue. Under this setup, the right hand begins a forehand drive of the needle at the bottom of the wound. The tip is walked to the epidermal surface with careful positioning; several small regrips occur as the operator optimizes the bite angle and depth before committing to the pass. The initial frames show the approach and entry rather than a completed crossing or any tying.

With the needle now through, attention remains at the inferior end. The right hand continues to hold the driver; the left hand transitions from forceps to managing the free suture tail. The operator completes the first pass across the incision at this lower corner and starts instrument tie maneuvers. The right hand lays loops with the driver around the standing end while the left hand provides counter-tension on the free end lateral and inferior to the corner. Throws are formed and tightened, but in this early sequence no fully secured knot is confirmed and nothing is trimmed. The stitch appears in progress rather than definitively locked.

Still working at the left margin near the lower-left tack, the surgeon takes another pass across the same left vertical incision. In this stretch, no forceps are used on tissue; instead, the edges are manipulated primarily by the needle and the suture itself. The right hand with the driver advances the needle forehand from the near to the far edge while the left hand tensions the strand to help evert the edges and control depth. The needle emerges on the opposite side, confirming a complete traverse across the wound, but tying is again deferred. The operator is clearly building the foundation for the first stitch but has not yet executed the knot.

Next the focus shifts to the superior end of the same left vertical incision. Forceps return to the left hand and grasp the near dermal edge to evert and stabilize it. The right hand, still with the driver and the needle grasped at the proximal third to mid-curve, drives the needle perpendicular to the skin. The needle is brought through the near edge, then regrasped after a partial exit to complete the arc through the far edge, consistent with good control of the curve. At this stage, the suture is now partly across the gap at the top of the wound; however, no knotting occurs yet. The left hand maintains eversion and edge control while the right hand repositions for the next maneuver.

There is a brief return to the lower-left quadrant. The same vertical slit along the left margin is presented by the left-hand forceps, which lift and evert the near edge at the inferior end. The right hand’s driver again advances the needle, with the needle oriented perpendicular to the simulated skin. Notably, the driver tip is occasionally used to support or retract the far edge, functioning as a surrogate retractor to maintain visibility and alignment. The needle is passed through the near edge and the thread is pulled through, signifying the initiation of another stitch attempt at the inferior end. No tying is undertaken in this interval; this is still set-up and passage work.

From here, the activity consolidates at the superior end of the left vertical incision. The left hand (top-left of field) holds tissue forceps to stabilize and evert the near edge near the upper corner; the right hand (lower-right to midline) controls the needle holder, at times briefly assisted by a second tool (scissors or hemostat) that helps manage suture loops but is not used for cutting. The needle remains gripped at the proximal third and is driven with a controlled wrist arc. The operator regrips after a partial exit—an appropriate move to keep the needle curvature working for them without bending the needle or tearing tissue. Symmetry of bite depth and width is maintained as the needle traverses from near to far at the top of the incision. The strand is then pulled across, and gentle traction begins to draw the edges toward approximation. Still, no knot tying is performed during this pass; it is preparatory, emphasizing proper bite geometry and eversion.

In successive passes at the top end, the right hand alternates between driving the needle and pulling the long suture strand clear of the field; scissors/hemostat are visible briefly but do not cut. The left hand consistently uses the forceps to keep the near edge everted and well presented. The needle is always kept approximately perpendicular to the skin, entering the dermis on the near side and exiting on the far, with the right hand’s driver occasionally acting like a mini-retractor to tuck the far edge into view. As the strand is pulled through, the two edges are coaxed toward each other with gentle tension rather than forceful traction. At this stage, several good-quality bites have been placed at the superior end of the wound, but a secure knot is still pending.

The first clear transition to knottying at the top occurs when the right hand, still with the needle driver, stops driving and begins instrument ties. The left hand continues to stabilize the near edge with forceps as needed but increasingly manages the free end of the suture to provide the counter-tension necessary for square throws. The needle is parked safely, and the driver is used to lay loops around the standing strand. The left hand alternates between maintaining tissue eversion and tensioning the tail. Scissors make a brief appearance as if to be ready for trimming, but in this sequence no cut is made yet. The throws are laid methodically, but a completed knot cannot yet be confirmed in these frames; tying is underway.

The next steps consolidate these throws. The forceps in the left hand shift from tissue to suture control, and the right hand uses the driver to capture and pull the looped strand through, cinching each throw while keeping the line snug over the superior end of the incision. The hands work across the wound centerline in an organized, opposing pattern to square the knot. By the end of this phase, the maneuver culminates in a secured tie at the top of the left incision. At this moment, one completed stitch is described as visible: a single knot sitting at the superior end with the edges approximated and no excessive crush. The knot looks to have been finished with standard alternating throws using instrument ties.

With that first tie set, the operator continues to manage the suture ends and inspect the result. The driver in the right hand stabilizes the standing limb while the left hand tests approximation at the top of the slit. The overall impression at this time slice is of a single, properly secured stitch holding the very top of the left vertical incision. The bite appears symmetrical, the entry and exit points are at similar distances from the wound margin, and eversion looks acceptable. The field shows no additional sutures started along this left line; only this top stitch is present by the end of this segment.

Immediately afterward, the technique shifts in a way that indicates the intention to anchor. The right hand, still with the driver, works just above the superior end of the incision to place and secure what is described as an anchoring stitch. No forceps are used on the wound edges here; instead, the left hand provides countertraction on the pad edge or manages the loop and tail while the right hand performs the tying. The descriptive emphasis is that an anchoring knot is created at the top corner, but no completed bites bridging the wound are visible in this view. This suggests either that the earlier-appearing top stitch was adjusted or converted to a corner anchor for a subsequent progression (as one would do at the start of a continuous technique), or that the camera view and timing capture the knot without the bridging bite in frame. In these final views of the left vertical incision, the summary provided is explicit: at this moment there are zero completed stitches spanning the wound; an anchor at the superior end is present, but there is no suture that traverses the gap to approximate the two edges.

The final portion of the sequence shows the hands moving away from the left border to the pad’s superior edge, near the top-left pin. Here, the right hand alternates between the needle driver and scissors while the left hand manages the needle and strand. The needle is regrasped and oriented perpendicular to a separate, short incision along the top edge, but no pass is actually made. This appears to be preparatory needle handling off the primary wound rather than active closure. No sutures are placed on this top-edge line during these frames, and this interlude does not change the status of the left vertical incision, which remains as last seen: anchored at the top with no completed bridging stitch.

Hand position and instrument evolution over time
- Early passes at the inferior end involve standard division of labor: right hand drives the needle; left hand uses forceps to evert and present the edge, then transitions to controlling the suture tail during tying attempts. At times, the left hand manipulates the suture without using forceps on tissue, relying on suture tension to aid eversion.
- Mid-procedure, at the superior end, the left hand consistently resumes forceps use to control the near (left) dermal edge, providing reliable eversion and exposure. The right hand maintains a perpendicular needle orientation, grasping at the proximal third and following the curvature with controlled wrist motion. Regrasping mid-curve and using the driver tip to support the far edge are recurrent, deliberate maneuvers.
- During knot tying, the right hand switches the driver’s role to loop and capture the suture for instrument ties. The left hand alternates between tissue and tail control, then primarily manages the free end to square the throws. Scissors and occasionally a second driver/hemostat appear transiently to manage slack or prepare for trimming, though actual cutting is not shown where noted.
- In the anchoring phase, no forceps are used to hold tissue; instead, the left hand supplies countertraction and strand control while the right hand finalizes an anchor at the top corner.

Technique consistency and evolution
- Throughout, the needle is consistently presented perpendicular to the skin surface with bites placed at the superior end that mirror each other in depth and distance from the wound margin. The operator demonstrates regrasping technique as the needle exits to complete each arc cleanly.
- Edge eversion is targeted primarily with forceps at the superior end; at the inferior end early on, there are moments where the surgeon relies more on suture traction for eversion rather than instrumented dermal control, a minor inconsistency that later improves with consistent forceps use.
- During knot tying, instrument ties are executed with the driver controlling the standing end and the left hand managing the tail, laying loops that are cinched down sequentially. Throws are alternated to square the knot.
- There is a noteworthy transition toward an anchoring step at the top after what appears to be a completed stitch earlier. In the final views of the active wound, this anchor is present, but there is no bridging bite visible across the incision. That pattern—an anchor without a bridging stitch—typically precedes the start of a progression down the wound if the selected technique were to be continued, though in this clip no such progression occurs.

Spatial relationships and movement relative to the wound
- The left vertical incision stays at the left border of the field. The left hand is generally lateral/superior at the top and lateral/inferior at the bottom, opposing the right hand, which is medial or slightly superior, crossing over the incision to drive the needle.
- The driver often crosses the wound midline and, at times, overlaps or passes proximal to the forceps during regrasping. This consistent opposing-hand configuration ensures controlled near-to-far passage and helps maintain perpendicular entry angles.
- The driver tip occasionally acts as a small retractor on the far edge, especially at the superior end, confirming precise entry point alignment before completing each bite.
- During instrument ties, the hands cross and recross predictably to lay and secure alternating throws while holding approximation at the superior corner.

Suture progression on the single wound and count tracking
- Start of case (lower end, 0–29 s): Several attempts at initiating the first stitch at the inferior corner are seen, including needle passage and early loop formation. No knot is completed, and no stitch is secured. Count remains 0.
- Lower-left pass (30–44 s): A complete traverse is made without tying. Count remains 0.
- Upper end series (45–119 s): Multiple accurate bites are taken at the superior end. Passes are completed; the suture is drawn through and the edges are gently approximated. Tying begins near the end of this period but is not yet secure. Count remains 0.
- First visible tie completion at the top (135–164 s): Instrument ties are completed and at that moment one stitch is described as secured at the superior end. Count appears to increase to 1 in these mid-late frames.
- Anchoring step and final view of the left incision (165–179 s): A top-corner anchoring knot is created and, critically, no completed bites bridging the wound are visible in this view. The description explicitly notes zero completed sutures across the left incision at this time. This late-view evidence supersedes earlier impressions for final-state counting.
- End of the video (180–193 s): Attention temporarily moves to a separate top-edge incision for needle management; no stitches are placed there and this does not change the status of the left vertical wound.

Final state and mandatory suture count verification
- The last frames that show the left vertical incision (165–179 s) document an anchor at the superior end but no stitch spanning the wound edges. Therefore, the final count of completed sutures across the left vertical incision is 0.
- Although a single stitch appears to be tied at the top earlier (135–164 s), the subsequent late sequence provides contradictory evidence, showing no bridging stitch present. Given the requirement to base the final count on what is visible in the later frames, the authoritative final count is 0 completed sutures spanning the incision.
- The procedure thus concludes with the wound still open, held only by a top-corner anchoring knot without a bridging bite, and with no additional sutures placed along the length.

Summary narrative of the single wound’s course
- One incision is worked throughout: the leftmost vertical slit along the pad’s left border. The midline incision with multiple existing stitches is never manipulated, and a brief interlude near the pad’s top edge involves only needle regrasping with no tissue passage.
- The operator begins at the inferior end with exploratory passes and early tying attempts that are not secured. The work then transitions to the superior end where multiple clean, perpendicular bites are taken with proper forceps-assisted eversion and regrasping control of the needle.
- Instrument ties are initiated at the superior end and appear to culminate in a secured knot in mid-late frames; however, the final views of this same wound show only a top-corner anchor without any bridging suture visible, indicating that the earlier apparent completion either was converted to an anchor or is not present in the final state.
- Hand positioning is consistent with standard technique: right hand drives and ties with the needle driver; left hand alternates between tissue forceps for eversion and managing the suture tail for tensioning during ties. The driver is sometimes used as a far-edge retractor to optimize bite placement.
- Technique is largely consistent: perpendicular needle orientation, symmetric bites, edge eversion maintained primarily with forceps at the upper end, and instrument ties performed with alternating throws. Occasional deficiencies include reliance on suture traction rather than forceps for eversion at the inferior end and a momentary detour to a different incision that does not contribute to closure.
- Final state: no completed sutures are present across the left vertical incision; only an anchoring knot near the superior end is visible. The total number of completed sutures at the end of the procedure is 0.
