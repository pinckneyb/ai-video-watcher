Pattern: Simple Interrupted

1. Perpendicular needle passes 3/5 competent
Needle was consistently loaded at the proximal‑middle third and presented near 90 degrees with arc‑following drives that limited shear. Occasional tip contact and reorientation before entry suggest minor variability, so this meets standard.

2. Gentle tissue handling 4/5 proficient
Forceps were largely idle and the left hand primarily stabilized the field and managed suture, avoiding repeated grasps or crushing. Handling remained consistently gentle throughout.

3. Square, secure knots 4/5 proficient
Alternating instrument throws were seated with balanced, opposing traction, yielding flat, square knots centered over the line. Tags were trimmed after securing, indicating attention to security and order.

4. Appropriate approximation/tension 3/5 competent
Knots were advanced deliberately with opposing vectors, removing slack without over‑tightening, resulting in controlled approximation. The method suggests edges meeting without excessive tension.

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm) 2/5 developing
Stitches were placed in a repetitive pass‑tie sequence without evident interval planning or reference to a consistent metric, leading to uncertain uniformity. Spacing discipline falls below standard.

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable) 3/5 competent
Perpendicular passes and central knot seating produced essentially flat approximation without deliberate eversion maneuvers. No inversion was apparent, but intentional eversion was not demonstrated.

7. Economy of time and motion 3/5 competent
The field was kept tidy and suture managed off the work area, but frequent instrument parking/retrieval, brief hand departures, and pauses reduced efficiency. Overall flow was competent yet not optimized.

Summative assessment:
Summative assessment
Your motion pattern is disciplined and repeatable: consistent needle loading, arc‑respecting drives, and organized instrument ties with balanced traction. The left hand effectively presents and manages the suture, and the working field remains clean, reflecting situational awareness and control.

To raise this to a training exemplar, institute a spacing plan (0.5–1.0 cm cadence), standardize bite width/depth symmetry, and use forceps purposefully to present edges and create reliable eversion while maintaining true 90‑degree entry/exit bilaterally. Streamline the flow by reducing instrument parking, minimizing hand departures, and maintaining momentum from pass to pass; keep the needle in hand whenever feasible and cut only when the knot is fully set to eliminate micro‑stalls.
