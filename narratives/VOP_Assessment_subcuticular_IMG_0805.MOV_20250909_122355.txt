Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your instrument handling, bite spacing, and knot mechanics are competent, and you maintained good triangulation with gentle eversion. However, this performance does not achieve a subcuticular closure: the path repeatedly exits through the epidermis and knots are left on the surface, breaking intradermal continuity and compromising the intended flat cosmetic result. To meet the subcuticular standard, commit to the intradermal plane. Start with a buried dermal anchor (or lateral/off‑line tie), then advance with alternating, shallow intradermal bites 2–3 mm from the edge, keeping the needle’s arc just beneath the epidermis and exiting within the dermis on each side. Maintain equal bite length and depth while keeping the epidermis pristine; finish with a buried knot or lateral tie‑off away from the incision line. Preserve your efficient hand choreography, but reduce unnecessary re‑grips and avoid any trans‑epidermal passes to maintain a continuous, smooth, subcuticular track.
