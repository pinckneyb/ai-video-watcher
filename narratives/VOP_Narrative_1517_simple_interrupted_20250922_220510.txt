COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a multi‑incision training pad, but the work consistently returns to and advances along a single vertical wound on the left side of the field. This left-sided slit begins the case gaping slightly and unstitched; as the sequence progresses it gains a short, even row of simple interrupted stitches with knots habitually seated to the patient’s left. Other slits are visible throughout and are occasionally inspected or briefly handled, but closure advances only along the left vertical wound. The following narrative traces the step‑by‑step development of that closure, highlighting how the operator’s hand positions, needle handling, and tying technique evolve while maintaining the same simple interrupted method throughout.

The case opens with deliberate needle placement at the left upper vertical slit. The left hand controls a needle driver while the right hand uses tissue forceps to evert and present the near dermal edge. The curved needle is held properly—about one‑third from the swage (or, in later moments, two‑thirds from the tip) and kept perpendicular to the epidermis—so the driver can follow the needle’s curve in a smooth arc. A near‑to‑far pass is taken cleanly: the tip enters the left lip with the margin protected by the forceps, traverses the wound at a symmetric depth, and exits at or near the right edge. The driver then re‑grasps near the tip to complete the arc and draw the strand through. The hands are opposed across the incision during this maneuver: forceps inferior‑right of the driver maintain eversion while the driver remains slightly superior‑left, centered over the intended entry. As the pass finishes, the suture is pulled to length with the strand arcing across the field, clear of the wound.

With that first pass in place, the operator transitions to knot tying over the same slit. The driver is used as a tying instrument, grasping the short limb and alternately passing loops of the long limb to lay square throws. The right hand, positioned far lateral to the field, controls the long end to provide steady counter‑tension and maintain a square down‑to‑wound vector while the knot is seated centrally. The edge coaptation is careful and controlled—enough to approximate and evert without blanching. Multiple throws are placed; the knot stack settles neatly at the superior edge of the slit with tails left temporarily long. Throughout, the driver tip stays centered over the wound; movements are compact, avoiding unnecessary crossing of instruments over the incision.

There is a brief interlude during which hands leave the field and a gloved right hand hovers near a separate small upper‑right incision without acting upon it. The left wound remains undisturbed during this pause. The surgeon then returns to the left vertical slit and prepares the next stitch adjacent to the first. This time, the right hand holds the needle driver and the left hand brings in tissue forceps. Again the needle is grasped around two‑thirds from the tip and oriented perpendicular to the skin. Forceps pick up the near (left) edge just below mid‑height, creating slight eversion and presenting the dermis to the needle. The driver advances from superior‑left toward the wound; the needle tip penetrates the near lip and is guided across to the far side. Thread management is thoughtful: the suture is kept extended superiorly so it doesn’t snag on the pad, and the tail trails to the right, clear of the entry site. The two instruments straddle the incision—driver superior‑left, forceps inferior‑right—so the arc can be followed through without torque on the wound edge.

Near this point in the recording, the operator briefly addresses an adjacent slit on the right side of the pad—examining, tensioning, tying, and trimming a single stitch there. This appears to be a momentary side task that does not change the progression along the primary left wound. The technique shown is the same—instrument ties with alternating directions to seat square throws, gentle approximation, and careful trimming—but when the view returns to the left, the closure there resumes exactly where it left off.

Back at the left slit, additional passes are placed. At times the operator drives the needle without separate forceps, relying on suture tension to maintain approximation while pulling the strand through. The driver alternates grips—initially grasping the needle around the proximal third for driving, then re‑gripping near the swage to draw the suture across—and the long limb is drawn laterally across the field to manage slack. When tying, the driver grasps the short limb and casts loops with the long limb; the left hand manages counter‑tension, bringing the knot down centrally over the incision. The hands consistently work in opposition with the driver superior to the bite and the assisting hand inferior/medial or lateral, maintaining an unobstructed view. On one pass, the left hand introduces scissors after the knot is laid to trim tails flush to the knot, reinforcing a tidy, low‑profile finish.

There is a short sequence in which the camera shows the needle poised at a completely separate lower‑left slit, the long vertical cut among three lower parallels. The needle is properly loaded and perpendicular, and the left edge is elevated with forceps to present the dermis—essentially the starting position for a new stitch. No tying or follow‑through is shown here, and the focus promptly returns to the left upper vertical wound. Given the continuity of the remainder of the case, this brief foray appears to be a training demonstration on another slit rather than part of the ongoing closure. It does not alter the progress of the left wound.

The main closure continues along the left vertical slit. The surgeon places and secures a stitch just left of center, below a previously tied stitch and to the left of a longer neighboring cut. This pass is exemplary: the needle is grasped at the proximal third, oriented perpendicular, and advanced through the near edge at a depth symmetric to the far edge. The right hand uses forceps to evert and present each margin, avoiding crushing while ensuring dermal purchase. After the exit, the driver re‑grips the needle to pull the strand through. Knot tying here is performed with two drivers opposing across the incision—one maintaining the loop, the other forming throws—an efficient variation of the same instrument‑tie technique used throughout. The loop is centered over the wound as successive throws are laid down, and the knot is seated without twisting. The suture is drawn across the field during tying but brought back to settle directly over the slit.

Subsequent sequences on the left wound show tying and securing previously placed passes. The driver holds the short end while the opposite hand tensions the long limb laterally across the field. Throws are alternated so each successive loop reverses the direction of the previous one, preventing slippage and producing a compact square knot. Edges remain everted and coapted; no blanching or gapping is seen. Where tails have not yet been trimmed, the driver maintains a gentle traction adjacent to the knot while scissors approach from the lower‑left. Tails are cut close, one at a time, with care to avoid nicking the knot.

The operator then initiates another stitch higher on the same left slit. The needle is reloaded two‑thirds from the tip; forceps lift the near wound edge to guide entry. The driver precedes the curve into the dermis, and the pass proceeds across the gap with the far edge ungrasped initially, then stabilized as needed. Knot tying follows immediately—instrument loops cast over the driver, the tail grasped and advanced, and the knot seated squarely on the epidermal surface. The surgeon demonstrates good tension control, approximating without over‑tightening and keeping the knot stack on the near side.

At one point, after finishing a tie at the superior portion of the slit, the operator reloads the needle in preparation for the next interrupted stitch along the same line. The hands maintain their familiar orientation: the right hand’s driver is just superior/left of the wound, while the left hand’s forceps or fingertips manage either tissue edges or the suture loop inferior/medial to the driver. The suture tails often extend laterally across the field during setup, then are brought back as the knot is seated directly over the wound.

A brief segment shows the surgeon manipulating a suture on a separate mid‑right incision—pulling, straightening, and adjusting a single preexisting stitch without placing a new bite. This is a quick adjustment that does not involve the left wound and is not sustained. Immediately afterward, the view returns to the left incision, where the superior‑most stitch is addressed. The right hand alternates between a needle driver for controlled tensioning and scissors for trimming. The driver holds the needle or the adjacent short end as needed, then yields to scissors that enter from the left to trim tails at the top stitch. The left hand is intermittent, likely maintaining counter‑tension just out of frame.

With several simple interrupted stitches now in place along the left slit, the operator performs a careful finishing phase. Multiple knots along the line are trimmed in succession. Scissors approach from the surgeon’s left and below; the other hand stabilizes the knot by holding a short segment of suture adjacent to the knot with a driver or by gently tenting the tissue with a fingertip. Tails are cut to short, clean lengths, leaving a tidy row of knots all oriented along the same side of the line. The wound edges show uniform approximation with slight eversion and mild, acceptable puckering consistent with simple interrupted closure.

Following trimming, there are inspection passes. A gloved hand uses forceps and a fingertip to palpate and tent the skin just lateral to the left incision, checking edge apposition, eversion, and the lie of the knot stacks. No new bites are taken during these inspections; the existing stitches hold the wound edges in good alignment. Instruments hover adjacent to the incision, testing tension and ensuring no segment is overly tight or gaping. The operator’s technique remains consistent: avoid unnecessary instrument crossing, keep the working tips within millimeters of the wound, and maintain a clear visual axis along the length of the slit.

A bit later, the surgeon identifies a small residual gap at the proximal end of the left wound and prepares an additional interrupted stitch. The right hand holds the needle driver; the left hand uses forceps to lift the near dermal edge, creating slight eversion and presenting a crisp entry site. The needle is clamped one‑third from the swage and presented perpendicular to the epidermis. The driver guides the tip to the precise point on the near edge, and the pass is initiated following the needle’s curvature. The far edge is not yet grasped at the moment of entry, indicating a deliberate, controlled approach. As before, suture management keeps the strand trailing away from the entry to avoid tangles. After the pass, the needle is parked and released from the driver to free the strands for tying.

The tying sequence at this topmost bite mirrors the earlier knots: instrument loops are cast over the driver, the short tail is grasped, and alternated throws are cinched down to seat the knot over the incisional midline. The left hand may hold forceps or briefly hold the tail to provide counter‑traction; the right hand, with the driver, guides the knot down. The forearms occasionally occlude the field momentarily as the surgeon reaches across the pad, but the driver returns to center to square the knot. As slack is removed, the wound edges show gentle eversion without blanching. The knot is stabilized, then scissors return to trim the tails cleanly at the top stitch.

Across the entire sequence on the left wound, the technique remains the same simple interrupted method. The operator consistently loads the needle at roughly the proximal third to mid‑shaft, keeps the needle perpendicular to the skin for each penetration, and follows the curve rather than levering through tissue. When forceps are used, they grasp the dermal edge lightly—just enough to stabilize and evert—avoiding crushing. When forceps are not used, approximation is maintained by judicious suture tension during tying. Knots are created with instrument ties: the driver grasps the short limb, loops are alternated in direction, and tightening is square and deliberate so the knot settles directly over the slit rather than to one side or off the wound. The suture loop is kept centered during tying; the long end is sometimes drawn across the field to remove slack, then brought back for seating. Tail trimming is performed close to the knot with careful protection of the knot stack.

Spatially, the driver and forceps (or fingertip) maintain a consistent relationship to the wound: the driver generally superior‑left of the slit during needle passage, forceps inferior‑right to present tissue; during tying, the driver stays just over the incision while the opposite hand manages the long limb laterally. As the closure progresses proximally, instrument positions shift slightly with the surgeon’s working angle but retain the same opposed geometry, preserving a clear, unobstructed line of sight along the wound axis.

There are two moments late in the video when the right‑side incision is touched—once for a brief inspection of a loose, untied pass and once with the hand hovering over the right wound without a driver in view. These episodes neither add a stitch nor advance closure at that site and, importantly, do not alter the work already completed on the left. They register only as brief interruptions in the view; the left wound remains the only line where placement, tying, and finishing proceed throughout the case.

By the end, the left vertical slit shows a short, orderly row of simple interrupted sutures spanning its length. Knots are small and neatly stacked along the patient’s left side with tails trimmed short. The wound edges are well approximated with mild, intentional eversion, no visible gaping, and no blanching from over‑tightening. The most proximal (top) stitch has been secured and trimmed, and residual slack has been removed along the line. After final inspection and minor palpation near the knots, the instruments withdraw, leaving a clean, evenly closed incision that reflects consistent technique from first pass to final cut.
