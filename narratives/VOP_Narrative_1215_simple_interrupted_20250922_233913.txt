COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a single, continuous closure of one linear wound on a silicone practice pad using simple interrupted stitches secured with instrument ties. The wound is a straight vertical slit that is revisited repeatedly across the session. At times the camera or pad orientation changes, so the same line appears at different positions within the frame (occasionally described as left, midline, or right), and in one brief segment the line appears horizontal; despite these perspective shifts, the work consistently continues along the very same wound. Where descriptions momentarily suggest another slit, instruments, suture continuity, and workflow confirm the operator never actually switches wounds; parallel cuts on the pad remain idle throughout.

Initial setup and the first passes focus on instrument readiness and accurate needle orientation. At the start, the needle driver hovers over the selected vertical slit and the opposite hand uses forceps to steady the needle and prepare tissue. The needle is mounted about one‑third from the swage to mid‑shaft, with the curve oriented for a perpendicular, controlled arc through dermis. The first moments are entirely preparatory—no penetration yet, just careful reloading and alignment to ensure a true perpendicular entry. The operator then moves along the same incision, now seen nearer the right side of the field, with the driver centered over the cut and pickups presenting the edge. The forceps gently evert the dermal margin, occasionally entering the slit for counter‑traction without crushing tissue. Thread from a prior passage is visible, confirming continuity on the same wound. The driver positions the needle tip adjacent to the lip for a right‑to‑left traverse.

The next sequence shows the same incision—now positioned centrally—where a new stitch is driven across the slit and immediately tied. The left hand holds the needle driver vertical over the wound; the right hand draws the suture across, then loops and cinches throws using the driver as the tying instrument. Forceps are not used in this tying phase; approximation relies on the suture’s tension. With each throw, the edges coapt at the stitch site. This pattern of driving a bite, parking or reloading the needle, and performing instrument ties recurs across the entire case.

Progressively, the technique settles into a rhythm centered over the mid‑portion of the wound. The operator consistently grasps the curved needle around the proximal third to mid‑shaft, maintains perpendicular entry, takes balanced bites on each side, then parks the needle in the driver (or leaves it on the suture) while instrument ties secure the stitch. Early on, tying is emphasized: throws are formed with the long limb managed to the right side of the field, the driver acting as the post. Hands cross briefly above the incision to square each throw. During these sequences, forceps usually lie idle; suture tension alone approximates the edges at the midpoint.

As the row begins to form, the operator alternates between placement and tying. There are multiple segments where the needle is not driven through tissue; instead, the driver simply holds the suture and acts as a tying post while successive throws are snugged down. This approach is repeated many times over the central segment of the same incision: the driver remains vertical and centered; the assisting hand pulls the free end laterally and then down to seat each throw. The knot stacks build in the midline as the operator secures each stitch before moving on.

Once a central stitch has been convincingly tied, the operator reloads for the next bite. The needle is again clamped at the proximal third, and the right wound edge is gently lifted with forceps to expose the dermal margin. The driver is brought in nearly perpendicular over the right edge to begin a right‑to‑left pass. This is a crucial pattern throughout: the hand holding the forceps everts and presents the edge; the driver advances the needle through an arc; the suture is pulled through; the needle is parked; then instrument ties follow. In these placement moments, the operator takes care to keep looped suture out of the field, usually managing slack to the right side to avoid entanglement.

At one point, the camera orientation shifts such that the incision appears horizontal; however, the behavior of the instruments and the existing knot line demonstrates it is still the same wound, just viewed from a different angle. The right hand continues to hold the driver; the left hand uses pickups to present near and far edges while the needle is repeatedly reloaded to align the curve. A pass is initiated just to the right of the existing knot cluster, building the row in a predictable stepwise fashion.

Tying remains meticulous. Over numerous segments, the needle is “parked” while throws are executed. The driver is used as a post for instrument ties, the free limb arcs across the slit, and the operator applies balanced opposing tension to square each knot flush to the skin surface. Often, no forceps are used during tying, which reduces manipulation of the skin but relies entirely on suture management for approximation. The operator maintains clean strand control by keeping the long limb to one side of the field, laying loops deliberately, and then drawing the knot down centrally.

As the closure extends, the operator alternates ends along the same incision, at times working just inferior to the prior stitch, at other times moving superiorly. On several sequences, the left hand holds the driver; on others, the right hand does, indicating comfortable ambidexterity. Despite this switching, spatial relationships remain consistent: the driver stays centered over the wound axis, the assisting hand (with forceps or fingers) is placed lateral to the bite site, suture slack is kept away from the operative corridor, and the instrument tips approach the tissue perpendicular to the skin for clean dermal purchase.

In the mid‑procedure, a notable transition occurs: after several stitches are placed and tied centrally, the operator begins placing new stitches just to the right of the growing knot line, then to its superior aspect. Here, tissue presentation with pickups becomes more frequent. The far edge is gently everted, helping the needle maintain a consistent depth through dermis. The driver advances the needle in a smooth arc, and the exit is retrieved cleanly on the far side. Suture is drawn through; then the needle is regrasped as needed to remain in optimal orientation. Each new pass is followed by the now‑standard series of instrument ties. The edges remain well approximated, with mild eversion achieved indirectly by the combined effect of bite placement and the tension of adjacent stitches.

Intermittent quality‑control moments punctuate the workflow. In one central segment, both hands come together with the driver and forceps to inspect and gently tension an existing knot stack without placing a new bite—likely assessing security before trimming. Elsewhere, the scissors are introduced decisively: the left hand elevates suture tails while the right hand brings scissors in vertically over the knot line to cut tails close to the knots. This trimming segment is carried out methodically along the central portion of the wound, clearing excess strands and giving the closure a cleaner profile. The scissors maintain blades perpendicular to the incision; the assisting hand controls tail tension so cuts are precise and close to the knot without loosening it.

After trimming, placement resumes along the same incision, extending the row. A pass is taken at the upper segment with the driver and forceps straddling the wound. The operator maintains a disciplined pattern: the needle is mounted about two‑thirds from the tip; the approach is perpendicular; the forceps evert the presenting edge; the needle traverses the near edge, crosses the gap, and exits the far side; the suture is drawn through; the needle is parked; and the stitch is secured with multiple instrument throws. The hands alternate positions, sometimes crossing briefly during knot tightening, then separating as the knot seats.

Later, preparation for additional stitches continues with the driver centered above the wound while the free limb is managed off to the side. At one juncture, the driver is held over the superior end with the needle parked on the free limb to the right, indicating a pause before the next pass. The operator reloads the needle off to the right side of the pad to optimize the arc for the coming bite, then returns to the incision to proceed. Each preparatory phase is consistent: align the needle curvature, confirm perpendicular orientation, present the tissue edge with pickups if needed, and keep the field clear by drawing excess suture away from the operative line.

As the row lengthens, the operator continues to place stitches toward both the superior and inferior ends of the same incision. In the inferior continuation, the driver hovers directly over the wound while the assisting hand pulls slack away to the right. Stitch placement is just below the previous one, maintaining spacing and alignment. The resulting pattern is a tidy sequence of knots with short, trimmed tails along the wound axis, each secured by methodical instrument ties.

Near the end, the focus is almost entirely on securing and locking the most recent stitches rather than driving new bites. The needle holder is used repeatedly as the tying instrument, with the free strand manipulated to form throws and the knot snugged down. In one sequence, the operator is clearly finishing the end of the line: the driver remains centered at the superior end; the other hand crosses in front to loop and pull throws; no new bite occurs, only locking maneuvers to secure the terminal stitch. Following this, another brief series shows the driver coming down over the midline to tension and dress the suture without introducing fresh passes. These finishing actions further confirm completion and consolidation of the closure.

The final frames show a momentary pause with both hands hovering near the now‑sutured slit. The needle rests with its holder off to the right side of the field; scissors and an extra forceps lie out of the operative line. No further manipulation of tissue occurs. Previously placed stitches are evenly spaced and approximating the wound edges along its length. Edge alignment is good; eversion is mild to moderate where forceps were used, and neutral where the operator relied solely on suture tension. Tail trimming has been performed on the central portion and, later, along added stitches to yield a tidy knot line. The closure reads as a sequence of properly placed simple interrupted sutures, each tied securely with multiple throws and tails cut close.

Throughout the case, the technique remains consistent and appropriate for simple interrupted closure:

- Needle control: The needle is almost always grasped at the proximal third to mid‑shaft, aligned perpendicular to the skin, and advanced in a smooth arc through dermis. The operator frequently reloads the needle to maintain ideal orientation before each pass.

- Tissue handling: Forceps are used when precise edge presentation or eversion is needed, particularly for later passes along the right side or at the upper segment. In many tying segments, no forceps are used; approximation is achieved by balanced suture tension.

- Knotting: Instrument ties are the standard. The driver acts as a post; loops are formed deliberately; the free limb is managed away from the incision to keep the field uncluttered; throws are alternately tightened and squared over the wound. Knot stacks sit directly on the incision line, and tails are trimmed close in a dedicated cutting sequence.

- Spatial discipline: The driver stays centered over the wound axis; the assisting hand positions lateral to the bite site or off to the right to manage slack. Hands cross only when necessary to seat knots. Instruments not in use (scissors, extra pickups, idle needle) are kept peripheral and out of the operative corridor.

A few observational inconsistencies in the frame descriptions—momentary references to leftmost or rightmost slits and one segment describing a horizontal wound—are best explained by camera or pad rotation rather than any change of target. The continuity of suture, the recurring knot stack along one line, and the unbroken pattern of instrument use confirm that the operator remains on the same single incision throughout.

By the conclusion, the linear wound is closed with a neat row of simple interrupted stitches. The edges are coapted along the entire treated length, with prior central knots trimmed and later stitches tied securely. The instruments are set aside; the needle is parked off to the right; and the wound sits approximated without gapping, reflecting a methodical, consistent application of simple interrupted closure from midline outward to adjacent segments and then to the ends, with attention to knot security and clean tail management.
