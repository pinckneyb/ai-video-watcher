COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on the rightmost of three parallel vertical incisions on the synthetic skin pad. From the first moment to the last, all suture placement, needle manipulation, and knot tying occur along this single right‑side slit, gradually building a neat series of simple interrupted stitches from the lower segment toward the superior end while the two central slits remain untouched.

The work begins at the lower third of this right‑side incision. With the driver in the left hand and tissue forceps in the right, the operator presents the right wound edge by gently grasping the epidermal/dermal margin and everting it. The needle is held near its mid‑shaft, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin, and advanced from right to left in a controlled arc. Initial penetration is deliberate and balanced, a textbook outside‑in approach on the right lip that sets up a symmetric traverse across the gap. This first engagement is more about establishing a controlled entry and path than about closure; the suture is drawn through just enough to confirm a clean track and proper needle orientation.

The driver then transitions to the dominant hand for subsequent maneuvers, with the non‑dominant hand alternating roles between supporting the pad and tensioning the free strand. Working still along the lower‑to‑mid portion of the incision, bites are taken with the needle clamped at its proximal third to midpoint, staying perpendicular to the wound to preserve geometry. During this period, the operator relies more on traction through the strand to approximate the lips rather than persistent tissue handling with pickups. The approach remains consistent: needle rotation through the near edge, sweep across, and pull‑through with the assisting hand. Even with minimal eversion in these early passes, the bites are matched in distance from the margin and depth to keep the closure line even.

Once the suture is positioned and the needle is comfortably loaded in the driver, the setup shifts to initiate and then finalize the first knot. The driver approaches from the upper‑right quadrant as the assisting hand steadies the pad and manages the suture slack. The right wound margin is firmed with fingertip countertraction rather than pickups in this phase. A single interrupted stitch is then completed in the upper third of the incision, where the operator takes a clean bite, approximates the edges without excess tension, and forms instrument ties. The knot is seated slightly off center, and scissors enter to trim the tails short. This marks the first fully completed stitch in the sequence and establishes the spacing and directionality of knots that will accumulate along the right side of the wound.

Immediately inferior to that newly formed knot, the next stitch is prepared. The needle is now in the left hand’s driver, with the right hand using forceps to evert the lateral edge. The needle orientation is once again perpendicular, the arc aligned to traverse cleanly across. The driver positions at the medial edge while the forceps stabilize the lateral lip, and the surgeon rehearses the exact entry point and depth to ensure a consistent stitch line below the existing knot. With positioning confirmed, the suture from the prior pass is parked superior‑right and kept out of the field.

The next series of frames concentrates on locking down the stitch already placed. The needle—grasped near its midpoint—is parked superior to the working site while instrument ties are formed. The needle holder and the free limb of suture are coordinated to build a secure knot over the mid‑portion of the incision. Throws are crafted over the tip of the driver, the standing end is grasped, and the knot is advanced down the limb to sit flush over the wound. Tension is alternated across the two limbs, long limb to the right/superior and short tail to the left, ensuring each throw is squared and the edges remain aligned without overtightening. Hands occasionally cross over the incision during regrips, but spacing remains controlled and the suture is kept clear from tangling.

With this knot seated, attention returns to stitch placement just superior to two earlier stitches in the central to upper segment of the slit. The driver holds the needle about one‑third from the swage, maintaining the preferred perpendicular approach. The needle is reloaded a few times to perfect angle and trajectory. The assisting hand intermittently engages with forceps to provide countertraction and light eversion, allowing the needle to enter outside‑in on one side and complete a balanced pass to the other. The suture is drawn across the gap; the free limb lies to the right of the field, and tying is deferred briefly while the operator reorients hands and instruments.

At the superior half of the wound, the surgeon briefly pauses further passage to consolidate the knot stack on a recently placed stitch. The driver acts from the right and slightly superior position, while the other hand manages the free end, seating the throws and aligning the knot with the run of the incision. This keeps the nascent closure neat and sets the stage for the next pass.

The technique then accelerates again into active placement. With the driver now in the left hand and forceps in the right, the lateral wound edge is everted. The needle is grasped about two‑thirds from its tip, set perpendicular to the skin, and directed for an outside‑in bite on the right edge. This deliberate, controlled entry again emphasizes geometry and consistency. The needle traverses across with wrist rotation and is regripped as needed for a smooth exit on the far side. The strand is drawn through to bring the new bite snug against the preceding stitch line, maintaining steady spacing and depth. The edges draw together with minimal crush, and the row of stitches begins to take on a uniform look.

The operator then positions for another superior‑directed pass. The driver remains on the right side of the pad, with the left hand using pickups to pinch and evert the near wound edge. The needle tip is carefully aligned a few millimeters from the margin, demonstrating attention to spacing and bite depth appropriate for the synthetic skin. After the pass is completed, the needle is parked while instrument ties secure the stitch. Multiple throws are formed sequentially, with the driver grasping the short limb and the other hand controlling the long limb across the incision. Each throw is advanced, cinched, and squared, yielding a compact knot that sits among the previous ones. The suture line now includes several evenly spaced interrupted stitches in the mid‑to‑upper segment, all with short tails trimmed on completion.

In the next interval, a new stitch is placed and left untied temporarily. The forceps elevate the right wound edge to present the exact entry site, and the needle advances with perpendicular orientation, using the curvature to minimize tissue trauma. The pass crosses the gap and emerges from the opposing edge cleanly. The suture is drawn through to appropriate slack, then left untied while the operator repositions. Soon afterward the same stitch is secured: the right hand manages the needle driver and suture, while the left hand braces the pad and applies counterpressure to the tissue. Scissors enter and trim the tails once the knot is finalized, demonstrating a rhythm of pass, secure, and cut that repeats as the closure line progresses.

With the two central slits still completely undisturbed, work continues up the right‑most wound. Hands alternate roles to optimize approach angles: sometimes the left hand holds the driver and the right hand uses pickups on the right edge; other times the driver returns to the right hand while the left hand manipulates the free limb during tying. The needle is generally grasped at the proximal‑to‑mid third or about two‑thirds from the tip, and the approach remains comfortably perpendicular to the surface. In some sequences, edge eversion is achieved with pickups and gentle traction; in others, the operator relies on fingertip stabilization or suture tension alone. Despite these variations, the stitch geometry stays consistent and the lips approximate without excessive gapping.

A particularly clear pass occurs as the forceps seize the needle tip mid‑pass for controlled transfer: after initial penetration, the tip is momentarily held by forceps before being regrasped with the driver to complete the arc. This maintains a smooth trajectory and helps avoid undue torque on the synthetic material. The stitch is then tied, with the knot placed just superior to the previous ones, preserving a tidy spacing pattern. Throughout these tying sequences, the driver frequently remains above and lateral to the incision line while the opposite hand holds the standing end at a complementary angle, allowing each throw to be seated straight down over the wound without twisting.

As the row lengthens, individual segments highlight different phases of the same cycle. In one sequence, the needle remains in the driver while multiple instrument throws are fashioned and advanced down to the wound; in another, the knot is fully seated and the tails neatly trimmed at an angled approach with scissors, careful not to disturb adjacent sutures. In yet another, the operator re‑loads the needle near the tip after tying to be immediately ready for the next bite. These small process refinements keep the work efficient and the field orderly.

Several segments underscore meticulous spatial awareness. The suture tail often lies to the patient’s left while the long limb trails to the right and slightly superior. The operator tensions these limbs in opposite directions to square the knot. The driver typically works just lateral and superior to the incision, while the assisting hand operates medially. Hands sometimes cross over during regrips or when swapping between driver and scissors, but crossings are brief and controlled, always returning to an opposed stance across the wound. The suture is kept out of the lower field and off the other incisions, preventing tangles and preserving a clear visual path for the next pass.

As the closure continues toward the superior end, additional stitches are placed and secured. On several passes, the right wound edge is elevated with forceps to present the bite, leading to cleaner eversion and better lip alignment. Where forceps are not used, the edges are still brought together primarily through suture traction, and although eversion is less emphatic in those moments, the approximation remains acceptable without obvious inversion or dog‑ears. The needle is consistently driven in a smooth arc, and depth and distance from the margin remain matched on both sides of the slit.

Knot tying retains a steady cadence. Loops are formed over the needle holder, the standing end is captured, and the knot is walked down along the suture to sit flush with the epidermal surface, each throw laid in alternating fashion to prevent slippage. Knot stacks collect on the lateral side of the wound or slightly off center, depending on hand positioning at the moment of cinching, but they remain low profile. After securing each stitch, scissors approach from the upper‑right or lateral side at about a 45‑degree angle to safely trim tails close to, but not compromising, the knot.

Near the upper‑middle portion of the wound, a sequence shows the needle set aside while throws are completed, then the tails cut. Immediately following, a new bite is placed even more superiorly using classic technique: forceps lift the near edge, the driver crosses the incision to take a balanced bite from far to near, and the suture is drawn across and tied. The hands maintain a tight working triangle over the superior end of the slit as the line approaches completion.

With the closure now well established, another stitch is placed and secured at the top segment. The operator steadies the right margin with fingertips, aligns the needle perpendicular to the skin, and drives it across with a gentle wrist motion. Edges are brought together by traction on the strand. Instrument ties lock the stitch in place, again with clear, square throws; the knot is tightened down to the incision and the tails are cut. The row exhibits even spacing, consistent bite depth, and minimal gapping between lips.

As the final steps play out, one sequence shows a quiet field: no hands or instruments are present, and the right‑side incision displays multiple completed stitches with short tails protruding laterally while the central incisions remain untouched. This static view offers a moment to appreciate the cumulative effect—an orderly run of simple interrupted sutures marching up the rightmost slit, knots neatly aligned and tails trimmed. No new bites or adjustments occur in that brief interval.

Across the entire procedure, the technique remains consistent with simple interrupted suturing and instrument ties. Needle grasp is reliably about one‑third from the swage to mid‑curve or two‑thirds from the tip, allowing precise control and perpendicular entry. When used, tissue forceps provide effective eversion and presentation of the dermal margin; when absent, the operator compensates with finger stabilization and suture traction. Spatial discipline is evident: the driver typically works lateral/superior to the slit; the assisting hand opposes across the wound; the suture is kept clear of the other two incisions and managed in a way that minimizes tangling. There are occasional moments where eversion appears minimal and a few intervals where the needle is parked during tying or the field is momentarily idle without visible hands, but these do not disrupt the continuity or the methodical progression of the closure.

By the end of the sequence, the rightmost incision displays a short, well‑spaced row of simple interrupted stitches that approximate the edges evenly from the lower to the upper segment. Knots are seated neatly, predominantly on the right/lateral side or slightly off center, and the tails are trimmed short. The wound edges are in apposition with slight eversion where pickups were used and acceptable alignment where traction alone sufficed. The two central vertical incisions remain untouched throughout. The final visual impression is of a controlled, stepwise closure performed along a single line, culminating in a tidy series of secured stitches that bring the right‑side wound into competent approximation.
