COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins and remains focused on a single wound: the rightmost vertical slit on the silicone skin pad, set close to the pad’s right edge. The other parallel cuts to the left are never actively sutured in the sequences described; at most, the non‑working slits are touched briefly for pad stabilization. Across the entire sequence the operator consistently brings instruments to bear across this same right‑side incision, advancing closure from its lower to mid and then upper segments. Throughout, the left hand primarily uses fine tissue forceps to evert and present the wound edges, while the right hand manipulates a needle driver and, at intervals, the free suture strand itself for tensioning and knot setting. This constant opposition of hands across the wound—forceps from the left side of the slit and driver from the right—establishes a stable working corridor with the needle driven right‑to‑left in a forehand motion.

At the outset (0–14 s), the operator establishes the line. The right hand holds the needle driver with its jaws perpendicular to the needle, grasping the curved needle at the proximal-to-middle third. The arc is set up to enter the right wound margin at approximately 90 degrees, which aids consistent, symmetric bites and edge eversion. The left hand supports eversion with the forceps—primarily controlling the right/lateral edge initially—so the needle can penetrate cleanly through simulated dermis. In this first window, a new pass is made but no knot is tied yet. The instruments are kept close to the wound; the driver follows the needle’s curvature across the gap, and the left hand hovers over the opposite edge to guide the exit and avoid undue tissue trauma.

Immediately afterward (15–29 s), the same incision is maintained. The right hand still controls the needle driver near the wound’s right side; the left hand alternates between briefly grasping the wound edge and then taking over the free suture tail as the operator transitions to tying. The needle has been pulled through and the thread delivered; the right hand begins instrument ties to secure the first placement. The suture is tensioned gently across the gap, keeping the edges approximated without crushing. At this point, the stitches are not yet counted as completed in the frame description; tying is underway, and the knot will be finished in the next segment.

That completion is captured next (30–44 s). A single stitch is fully secured at the superior area of this right‑side slit. The right hand employs the needle driver for instrument ties while the left hand controls the suture ends, and the operator cinches the knot while maintaining slight eversion at the apex of the loop. The suture lies perpendicular across the incision, the knot seated slightly to the right of midline as is typical when tying from the near/right side. Scissors rest nearby but are not used in these frames. By the end of this segment, there is one secured stitch on the line.

With that anchor in place, attention moves toward the lower end (45–59 s). The incision’s inferior third is approached with the same coordinated hand positions: the left hand’s forceps evert the near edge, and the right hand advances the needle from right to left in a perpendicular trajectory. The driver initially grasps the needle about two‑thirds from its tip to permit a confident initial entry; as the needle emerges, the driver re‑grips closer to the tip to complete the arc through both edges without undue torque. The tissue is synthetic skin, and the operator is careful to take bites a few millimeters from the margin for strength while avoiding large, unnecessarily traumatic passes. The strand is drawn through; no knot is tied yet in this specific window, which focuses on passage at the lower end while the previously tied knot sits superiorly and out of immediate focus.

The next window (60–74 s) shows the same inferior area as the right hand again holds the driver and the left forceps maintain eversion. The needle is driven across the wound, right to left, and the suture is pulled through to create a loop outside the wound in preparation for tying or for continuation of the selected closure technique. Although the frame‑level count here notes no completed, tied sutures visible in the field, this reflects the camera’s focus on the lower segment; the earlier knot remains part of the overall line superiorly. The instruments maintain parallel orientation to the incision, and hand positions briefly cross as the strand is pulled through to avoid tangling.

By 75–89 s, the instruments are working around the lower to mid‑portion of the same slit. The left hand’s forceps repeatedly evert the left/far wound edge; the right hand’s driver grasps the needle about two‑thirds from the tip and drives a forehand pass from the right edge across to the left. One stitch is clearly present on this incision, with tails visible, and a second bite is being set up just superior to it along the same wound. The needle is retrieved on the left, aided by the forceps, and then reloaded for the next throw. The operator’s spatial coordination remains clean: hands oppose each other across the line and converge over the slit, with scissors resting off to the right but not engaged.

At 90–104 s, the operator focuses on securing what was just placed. The left hand returns to forceps to steady and slightly evert the edge, then releases and re‑grasps during knot setting. The right hand, now using the needle holder primarily as a tying instrument, completes the throws and tensions the knot over the wound. The lone completed stitch visible in this view is now fully seated; the needle is briefly parked and reloaded as the operator prepares to continue along the same incision. The hand choreography during tying is precise: the right hand brings the driver across the field to deliver loops while the left hand provides counter‑tension on the tails, then both hands separate widely to set the throws.

The next two windows (105–119 s and 120–134 s) show continued preparation and passage for additional bites along the same scar line. The incision remains the vertical rightmost slit, shorter than the central one and near the right edge. A single completed stitch is visible through both sequences; the driver and forceps cooperate to pass a new bite first inferior to the existing knot, then slightly superior along the same wound. The needle is regripped near the tip at times to finish the arc; the left hand elevates the opposite edge so the bite depth and spacing remain consistent. During these sequences, the right hand occasionally manages the free suture end during tensioning and reloading. The operator is careful to enter at approximately 90 degrees, preserve gentle eversion, and avoid unnecessary crush with the forceps.

By 135–149 s, the line shows progress: two completed stitches are present along this incision, and a third pass is underway at the top of the field. The left forceps control the far edge for countertraction and elevation, and the right hand drives the needle through the near/right edge across to the far. Instrument ties are initiated immediately after passage; although trimming is not shown here, the knot is tightened. The cumulative effect is a neatly approximated wound with small, evenly spaced bites and mild eversion.

In the subsequent sequences—150–164 s, 165–179 s, and 180–194 s—the closure proceeds in a continuous fashion along the same right‑side slit, with the visual appearance of a simple running line consolidating what began as anchored stitches. The right hand continues to grasp the needle roughly at the proximal third; the left hand lifts or steadies the closer edge to present the bite site. At 150–164 s, four completed bites of a running sequence are visible in the mid‑to‑lower portion while the operator sets up the next pass more proximally. The driver is aligned near‑perpendicular to the pad surface, and the left hand alternates between edges to keep both sides slightly everted for a well‑sealed epidermal approximation. At 165–179 s, another pass is taken and the free strand is drawn through and tensioned; the running line remains neat, with four completed placements evident along the closure as the operator prepares the next throw at the top end. By 180–194 s, the surgeon continues this rhythm at the superior segment of the incision: forceps in the left hand elevate the edge, the driver in the right hand pulls through the far edge and reloads for the next bite, and tension is maintained on the free strand to lay the loops evenly without strangulation. Throughout these continuous segments the suture line advances toward the superior end, always on this same right‑most incision.

At 195–209 s, the continuous closure is clearly established. The left hand stabilizes the wound edge near the center‑to‑superior segment and, at moments, lightly steadies the adjacent central slit only for pad stabilization; there is no suturing outside the right‑side wound. Notably, the right hand momentarily manipulates the needle with fingers near the mid‑body rather than with the holder, maintaining a roughly perpendicular orientation as it passes the tip through one edge and then across. The free suture is guided so that loops lie flat and parallel to each other. At this point, five completed bites are visible along the right incision, and a new pass is being taken near the superior end as tension is modulated to align the margins.

Approaching the end (210–224 s), activity remains confined to the same incision, now near its upper‑right corner. The right hand initially holds the needle driver and then switches to tissue forceps to control the right/near edge, while the left hand reloads the needle in the driver—an efficient exchange that maintains control at the bite site. The needle is reloaded about two‑thirds from the tip, aligned perpendicular to the surface, and set up to enter the near edge for the next pass. The prior line shows multiple stitches in place; within this field of view three completed stitches are visible as preparation occurs for another bite. No additional pass is completed by the final frame of this segment; the team is setting up for the next throw at the superior end while managing the strand and instruments.

The final view (225–231 s) captures a pause in needle driving and the onset of finishing maneuvers. The curved needle stands parked upright in the pad at the superior end of the same right‑side incision, a common method to hold its position safely while the strand is managed. The left hand, positioned superior‑left, holds and organizes the free suture so that tension on the line is controlled. The right hand transitions from the needle holder to scissors placed just lateral to the wound—a clear signal of impending trimming. No new bite is taken in these frames. Along this wound, three secured stitches are visible in the camera’s frame, forming a short, evenly spaced line with mild edge eversion. The other cuts on the pad remain untouched.

Hand positions and instrument choreography remain consistent throughout. Early and mid‑procedure, the left hand uses forceps to gently lift and evert whichever edge is being penetrated next, alternating from near to far as needed. The right hand holds the needle driver with the jaws perpendicular to the needle so that each bite enters at ~90 degrees to the skin, which optimizes edge eversion and prevents long, shallow passes. The driver often grasps the needle at the proximal third at the moment of entry, then re‑grips closer to the tip to complete the exit cleanly. The right hand also intermittently manages the free suture end, drawing it through to eliminate slack and tensioning to seat loops evenly. When tying is required—either to anchor the starting point or to secure an isolated placement—the right hand uses the driver to perform instrument ties while the left hand controls the standing and tag ends. As the work progresses proximally, the hands migrate together up the wound and then separate widely to tension sutures, before reuniting at the incision for reloading. Near the end the needle is parked upright for safety while the right hand switches to scissors to trim; the left hand maintains strand control to prevent loosening as cuts are made.

The technique itself remains coherent when interpreted as a continuous closure along a single incision. The line is initiated with a secured stitch at the upper end, then expanded with subsequent passes that, by mid‑sequence, clearly take on the cadence of a simple running line: bites are evenly spaced, taken perpendicular to the skin surface, and the strand is advanced in a contiguous fashion from inferior toward superior. Edge eversion is actively maintained by forceps throughout. While some windows document instrument ties consistent with anchoring maneuvers, and others emphasize running progression, these are not contradictory when considered as stages of the same selected technique—anchoring and continuation of a continuous closure require both passing and occasional knot handling. The apparent oscillation between “interrupted” and “running” described in different frame notes is most reasonably attributed to selective framing (for example, zooming into different segments of the same wound where only part of the line is visible) and the normal alternation between passage and tying motions.

Counting of placed sutures over time reflects both real progression and the camera’s field of view. Early in the case, one stitch is tied and seated at the superior end (by ~30–44 s). The operator then works inferiorly to place additional bites, which are passed and tensioned (45–74 s). Through 75–134 s, only one completed stitch is consistently visible while new bites are being set up and secured. By 135–149 s, there are two completed stitches on this same incision, and a third pass is underway at the top. Over the next several windows (150–194 s), the closure resembles a running line with four completed placements apparent, advancing toward the top; by 195–209 s, five completed bites are visible in that view. However, in the final approach to trimming (210–224 s and 225–231 s), the camera view narrows to the superior end, and three completed stitches are visible in that final frame set while the needle is parked and scissors are introduced. The discrepancy between mid‑sequence counts and the late three‑stitch view is attributable to changes in camera framing and to the fact that we are required to report only what is visible in the final frames.

Final state and suture count verification:
- The work has been performed exclusively on the rightmost vertical incision throughout the procedure, progressing from its lower to upper segments.
- The wound edges are approximated with mild, consistent eversion. The suture loops lie evenly, oriented perpendicular to the wound, with spacing preserved from the mid‑lower segment toward the superior end.
- The needle is parked upright at the superior end while the right hand brings in scissors to trim; the left hand holds the free strand to maintain tension.
- Exactly three completed stitches are visible in the final frames. This is the definitive final count for the procedure as captured.

In summary, the surgeon selects and stays with the same right‑side vertical incision from start to finish, establishing an anchored beginning and then building a continuous line of closure up the wound. Hand positions remain complementary—left forceps for eversion, right driver for precise forehand passes right‑to‑left—and spacing and bite depth are kept consistent to optimize approximation. The suture line evolves from a single secured stitch to multiple finished placements; despite intermediate windows showing more bites in other views, the concluding view demonstrates three completed stitches at the time the needle is parked and trimming begins. The procedure, as documented in the final frames, results in 3 completed sutures.
