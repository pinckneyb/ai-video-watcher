COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel, vertical slits. From the outset, attention is fixed on the rightmost incision near the pad’s right border. This wound remains the focus throughout, and every step, adjustment, and progression centers on closing this single line from its inferior end toward the superior edge. The two other incisions remain untouched except for a brief, separate demonstration interlude mid-sequence that does not alter the plan or continuity of the closure being performed on the right-side wound.

Initial setup and first entries at the inferior end establish precise technique and instrument roles. The operator works bimanually with the needle driver in the left hand and Adson forceps in the right. The curved needle is consistently loaded at its proximal third to middle third, oriented perpendicular to the pad’s surface for perpendicular entry. At the lower third of the rightmost slit, the forceps gently evert the near wound edge to present the dermal margin with minimal crush. The driver advances the needle in a smooth arc, following the curvature with controlled wrist rotation. After entry, the driver releases and regrips the needle along its body to maintain control and then completes the passage across the incision to emerge at a symmetric point on the opposing edge. The suture is drawn through and lays in a long loop, with the free strand kept clear of the field. During these earliest passes, the suture is not yet secured with a knot; the operator is establishing the first stitch and the working rhythm, keeping the needle and thread under precise control and the edges slightly everted.

Within the lower half, the sequence progresses steadily. The left hand maintains fine control of the needle driver while the right-hand forceps pick up the wound margin 1–2 mm from the edge to optimize eversion and prevent edge rolling. Entries and exits are placed at consistent distances from the cut edge on both sides. The needle is reloaded between passes as needed to preserve a 90-degree approach and a reliable right-to-left arc. As each pass completes, the suture is pulled through smoothly and tensioned just enough to approximate the edges without blanching or strangulating the tissue. The loop is kept broad and out of the bite path, often trailing superiorly and to the left, ensuring no entanglement with the instruments.

Early in the closure, an anchoring step is performed at the inferior end. Following one of the early passes near the bottom, the needle is parked safely and the operator transitions to instrument ties. The knot is formed centrally over the wound with the driver acting as a pusher and the assisting hand controlling the opposite limb. Throws are placed in sequence, cinched snugly to secure the stitch at the lower end. Scissors arrive, align parallel to the skin surface, and trim the tails close to the knot while the forceps gently elevate the knot for safe cutting. This anchor stabilizes the line and provides a reliable base for a continuous progression up the incision.

With the anchor established, the operator resumes forehand needle driving across the rightmost incision, still at the inferior third and moving toward midline. The right-hand pickups continue to evert and stabilize the wound edges, presenting the dermis for each bite. The needle is driven through the right margin, across the gap, and out through the left at equivalent depth, then drawn through fully. At times, the right hand briefly trades the forceps for a needle driver to help control suture or needle extraction, but the overarching setup remains consistent: driver on one side of the wound, forceps on the other, instruments crossing the wound during passage and then separating for tensioning. When the needle emerges, the tip may be grasped by the pickups to assist in drawing the needle through without tearing the pad. The free suture limb is constantly managed to avoid loops catching on the field.

As the run ascends through the lower third into the mid-portion, the same fundamental pattern repeats: perpendicular needle orientation, short controlled arcs, regripping the needle mid-curve as needed, and symmetric bites on each side. The suture is drawn through after each pass and laid along the line to approximate the edges. At one point in the mid-to-lower segment, the operator briefly secures the working strand with additional throws, then trims a short tail. This appears to be a method of locking and tidying the line at a natural checkpoint, preventing loosening as the closure progresses upward. The scissors come in from the left, and while one hand maintains tension and position on the strand, the other trims deliberately without lifting or traumatizing the tissue. After this, the run continues uninterrupted up the incision.

Throughout this middle portion, triangulation and spatial organization remain exemplary. The driver usually works just left of the rightmost incision, approaching from left-to-right across the slit, while the forceps stabilize the right wound edge. The instruments converge over the wound only during the needle pass and then diverge to apply tension or regrip the needle. The operator keeps both hands within a few millimeters of the wound, maintaining clear visualization and control of both tissue and suture. The needle is habitually grasped at the proximal third of the curve for maximum driving torque, and the tip is directed to exit cleanly on the opposing side at a matching distance from the edge. The suture loops are laid deliberately, and the strand is routed superiorly and away from the immediate bite site to avoid contamination of the field.

There is a brief interlude where the camera and hands appear over the central slit. A stitch is demonstrated and tied on that middle incision, likely a separate teaching pass. Importantly, this does not interrupt or change the ongoing closure plan for the right-side incision. Immediately thereafter, the work returns to the rightmost line, and the continuous progression up that same incision resumes. The prior bites on the rightmost wound remain intact and approximating, and no suturing is pursued on the left or central incisions as part of the right-side closure.

Advancing into the upper half, the operator continues to place additional bites along the rightmost incision with the same technique: the right wound edge is everted with forceps for entry, the needle arcs across in a forehand motion, and symmetric exits are achieved on the left edge. The suture is drawn through, the loop is cleared, and the edges are brought together with gentle, even tension. Needle handling remains deliberate—reloaded between passes to keep the needle perpendicular to the skin and the arc smooth. On several occasions, the needle is regripped mid-pass to maintain an optimal angle and to complete the arc without bending or wobble. When the operator parks the needle, it is kept off the tissue and controlled in the needle holder to avoid accidental sticks or tissue trauma.

As the run approaches the superior third, the technique includes periodic locking of the running line. The operator forms a loop and tightens it on the right margin to lock a pass before proceeding. This locking adds security to the run as tension grows with additional stitches. In this region, the tools occasionally switch roles momentarily—the right hand may hold the driver while the left hand steadies tissue or manages the suture—but the core principles are maintained: perpendicular entries, symmetric margins, tissue eversion with minimal crush, and clean suture management. The strand’s long limb is kept trailing toward the superior-left or arced broadly away from the wound to prevent entanglement with the driver or pickups.

Near the apex, the edges are already well approximated by the accumulated passes below. A previously placed superior stitch is secured with instrument ties. The needle is held or parked, and the driver becomes a tie instrument; the assisting hand controls the opposite limb or the tissue as the throws are formed and seated. The knot is advanced down onto the wound surface, just tight enough to maintain edge eversion and apposition. The hands cross the wound perpendicularly during knot seating, and then separate to set final tension.

With the superior end in sight, the operator places final passes to complete the closure along the last open segment at the top. Again, the right wound edge is lifted to expose the bite site; the needle advances in a controlled arc with perpendicular entry; the far edge receives a symmetric bite; the suture is drawn through and tensioned. At this stage, even small variations in bite depth are minimized, and spacing remains consistent with the line below. After a final pass, locking loops are placed to secure the terminal segment. The left hand often maintains steady traction on the standing limb while the right hand manipulates either the needle driver as a tie instrument or brings scissors in to cut.

Terminal knot completion is deliberate and secure. The operator alternates throws to avoid slippage, seating each throw squarely over the wound with the tissue slightly everted. The needle tip is kept away from the suture during tying to prevent fraying. Once satisfied with the security and position, scissors approach parallel to the skin; one hand maintains tension as the other trims the free tail. The tail is cut close without jeopardizing the knot. During this phase, the driver may hold the suture near the knot to sustain tension while the scissors make the cut; afterward, all instruments withdraw, leaving a clean terminal knot with a short, tidy tail at the superior end.

At one point, a still view captures the incision with its mid-to-lower segments well approximated and the top relatively open—an interim state that underscores the directionality of the run from bottom to top. Subsequent sequences show the superior passes, locks, and final ties that complete the closure. By the end, both the inferior anchor knot and the superior terminal knot are in place, and any intermediate trimming that was performed has left no distracting long ends. The line of stitches is continuous, with regularly spaced bites and consistent bite depth. Edge eversion is preserved across the length, and the wound margins lie in gentle, even apposition without excess tension or gapping.

Throughout, spatial relationships and setup are consistent and purposeful. The needle driver primarily operates on the operator’s left of the rightmost incision, crossing the wound during passage and then regripping as needed; the forceps inhabit the right margin to present tissue and occasionally assist in needle retrieval. The suture limb trails predictably and is managed to remain out of the immediate field. The instruments work within a few millimeters of the wound, and the driver needle orientation remains perpendicular to the skin, enabling precise control of entry and exit points. When scissors appear, they align parallel to the surface for safe cutting, guided by gentle elevation of the suture by the assisting hand. The interplay of hands is fluid: the driver leads the needle; the forceps coordinate exposure and eversion; both hands coordinate tensioning and knot tying with minimal extra movement.

The final result is a carefully executed closure of the rightmost vertical incision using a continuous sequence of dermal bites, punctuated by secure locking and definitive knots at the ends. The inferior anchor establishes the foundation; the running line advances with symmetric, evenly spaced bites; the superior end is closed with locking throws and an instrument tie; and all tails are neatly trimmed. The wound edges are approximated along the entire length with slight eversion, no visible strangulation, and even spacing, reflecting consistent technique and meticulous suture management from the first inferior pass to the final superior trim. Any transient activity away from this incision is brief and separate from the closure itself; the rightmost wound remains the sole site of the suturing work described, completed to a tidy, secure finish.
