============================================================
The sequence opens with meticulous work focused on a single, short linear wound along the upper edge of the silicone pad. This is a shallow horizontal slit at the top center/right of the field, and all subsequent activity returns to this same line as it is methodically closed from its central region outward, then consolidated toward the right end until the gap is fully eliminated and the knots are groomed.

The first frames establish the technique and pacing. With the wound centered in view, the left hand brings in a needle driver while the right hand controls Adson-type forceps. The needle is mounted correctly, grasped on its body at the proximal-to-middle third and presented perpendicular to the skin surface. The forceps gently lift and evert the near edge, creating a slight “shelf” for purchase, and the needle is advanced with a smooth, wrist-driven arc rather than pushing straight. After the first bite through the superior lip, the right hand repositions the forceps to the opposing edge to guide and protect the exit. The suture is pulled through, leaving an appropriate tail. The instruments then transition from passage to tying: the driver maintains control of the standing limb while the opposite hand manages the free end. Instrument ties are formed directly over the slit with square throws laid flat. The knot seats snugly on the skin with the edges approximated, the forceps having preserved slight eversion.

Building on this foundation, the work continues along the same upper horizontal cut. The hands alternate as needed: at times the right hand adopts the needle driver and the left hand switches to pickups, but the operating geometry remains consistent—driver perpendicular to the skin, forceps opposite to stabilize tissue near the intended bite. A new pass is taken on the same line in the upper-right portion, drawn through, and the knot is initiated with the needle parked while loops are formed. Across these early sequences, no other slits are manipulated; the suture limbs remain close to the wound, and throws are squared deliberately with balanced counter-tension to avoid twisting or strangulating the tissue.

As additional stitches accumulate, the central portion of the wound becomes well approximated. The operator moves slightly left and then right of this central area to expand the row. On the left-of-center segment, forceps again lift the dermal edge while small, symmetric bites are taken close to the cut margin, entering and exiting at matched distances. The needle is held roughly two-thirds from the tip, maintaining optimal leverage for controlled passage. After each pass, the suture is drawn up smoothly to seat the loop, and instrument ties secure the stitch with alternating throws. The tails are trimmed to tidy lengths, leaving neat, low-profile knots that rest just on the surface.

Attention then shifts toward the right half, where a small gap remains. The right wound lip is controlled with pickups, everting the edge as the driver approaches from the left or superior-left. The needle orientation remains perpendicular; the arc is followed across both edges. The suture is drawn through, edges are brought together, and the knot is formed with careful, opposing traction to maintain approximation and preserve the desired eversion. In some sequences the needle is parked while the driver executes instrument throws; in others, the needle is reloaded promptly after tying to prepare for the next bite. The team maintains a disciplined working distance, with instrument tips staying within a few millimeters of the incision and hands straddling the wound to keep visualization clear.

Through the middle portion of the procedure, the rhythm alternates between placement and tying along the same rightward progression. A pass is placed to the right of the prior knots; the suture is drawn through; instrument ties follow; tails are cut. At times, the operator pauses post-passage to equalize suture lengths before forming the first throw, ensuring the knot will lie centered over the entry/exit points. The driver often crosses the wound axis during throws, and the forceps back off the tissue to manage the tail, then return to stabilize the edge during final cinching. Small spatial variations appear—sometimes the driver approaches from the superior-left, sometimes from directly above or the right—yet the underlying mechanics remain consistent: perpendicular needle, wrist-driven rotation, matched bite depth on both sides, and gentle tensioning to set each stitch without crushing or gapping.

A few frames briefly show trimming activity on a segment that appears vertically oriented in the camera’s view. Despite that apparent change, the surrounding landmarks, the row of existing knots, and the continuation of work at the right side corroborate that this is simply the same top incision viewed at a slightly rotated angle of the pad or camera. In these moments, the needle is typically parked on the suture while scissors enter to clip tag ends flush with the previous knots. No work is shifted to any other incision; all actions relate to grooming and completing the same continuous row.

The technique itself is consistent and deliberate. Throughout, the needle is grasped correctly—often two-thirds from the tip, sometimes closer to the midshaft for leverage when dense material is encountered. The driver follows the curvature of the needle through the synthetic skin rather than pushing linearly, limiting tissue trauma. The forceps are used thoughtfully: they lift and evert edges at the moment of entry, then switch to the opposing side to help the needle exit cleanly and to protect the tissue from crushing. Bites are short and symmetric, taken close to the cut edges with a consistent margin. Eversion is present but not exaggerated; the goal is a tidy epidermal approximation with minimal gaping and evenly spaced knots.

As the right end of the wound draws closer, the operator continues to fill any small residual gaps. In some segments the driver positions the needle for entry on the far-right edge, then regrips mid-curve to complete the passage smoothly. The suture is pulled through, the loop is seated, and instrument ties are performed with the offhand controlling the free end. When the knot is secure, scissors step in to trim tails to length, leaving a clean knot line. On other passes the focus is on preparing: scissors first trim the tails from a previous stitch to clear the field, the driver reorients the needle at ninety degrees to the skin, and the forceps evert the next bite site before the needle is driven again.

Late in the sequence, with the central-to-right section already populated with stitches, a pass is added just left of a previous cluster to smooth the transition between stitches and ensure uniform spacing. The forceps remain slightly ahead of the needle path, presenting the tissue and controlling any tendency of the edges to collapse inward. The driver advances across the incision, the suture is drawn up, and the loop is tightened to seat the stitch in line with its neighbors. A few moments later, the attention returns to the rightmost zone to continue extending the row to the very end of the slit. Here, the field shows the driver held just above the wound line while the free suture end is gently tensioned laterally to keep the strand out of the needle’s path. After the bite is taken and the thread pulled through, the operator takes time to equalize limb lengths, then ties. Each throw is squared, laid flat, and seated with controlled opposing traction, keeping the wound edges evenly approximated.

In the closing moments, the final rightward passes are completed. A stitch is driven at the terminal segment, drawn through, and tied. The scissors approach to cut the new tails and, as needed, to groom neighboring knots for a clean finish. In one brief sequence, scissors alone enter to clip protruding ends along the right margin while the needle remains off to the side on the free suture; again, the visual suggests a vertical orientation due to the camera angle, but the context and adjacent knot line confirm this is the same wound’s right end being tidied. After these trims, the line presents a neat series of discrete knots, each resting on the surface, with tag ends shortened and aligned.

Across the entire procedure, the spatial choreography is tight and efficient. The hands consistently straddle the incision: when the driver is superior/medial, the forceps are lateral/inferior, and vice versa. The needle driver works just above the wound axis, occasionally crossing it to maintain a perpendicular approach or to deliver square instrument throws during tying. The forceps alternate sides precisely at the moment of each penetration or exit, providing stabilization and gentle eversion without crushing. When the operator transitions from passage to tying, the needle is regripped or parked to prevent drift, slack is taken out methodically, and each throw is advanced down the long limb with the driver and set with opposing traction from the assisting hand. Throughout, instrument tips remain within a few millimeters of the wound edge, reflecting close control and a consistent working distance.

Technique consistency is a hallmark of the sequence. Every pass respects the needle’s curvature; bites are symmetric and small, near the wound edge but not so close as to risk tearing. The operator regrips midway through the arc when needed to maintain control and an appropriate angle of attack. The strand is never yanked; instead, it’s drawn through with measured tension to minimize tissue trauma and to prevent puckering. Knot tying is executed with clear, squared throws, alternating hand dominance as necessary to avoid twisting the wound or laddering the knot. When trimming, the scissors approach the knot tails at a safe angle, snipping them to a tidy, uniform length without undermining the throw.

By the end, the short upper horizontal laceration is fully closed along its length. The central portion, addressed early, remains neatly approximated with slight eversion preserved by the discrete stitches. The right end, which initially displayed a residual gap, has been progressively filled with additional stitches placed just adjacent to the existing ones and then tied and trimmed. The final appearance is a single, continuous row of evenly spaced knots sitting flush on the pad’s surface, the edges brought together in stable apposition with no significant gaping or inversion. The suture tails are groomed and short, and the needle has been parked or removed from the immediate field, signaling completion. All activity has remained dedicated to this one top horizontal wound from start to finish, with the same careful cadence—precise bites, controlled arcs, balanced tension, square instrument ties, and careful tail trimming—applied step by step until the closure is complete.
