COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a single, continuous skin closure performed on a synthetic practice pad: a short vertical linear incision located on the right side of the pad (roughly 1–3 cm in length). From the first image sequence through the final frames the operator returns repeatedly to this same slit and methodically closes it by placing a series of interrupted stitches adjacent to one another until the wound is approximated and secured.

Initial approach and setup (0–60 s)
At the start the field shows the short right-sided vertical slit already prepared for closure, with a row of previously placed interrupted sutures along one margin indicating an ongoing serial closure pattern. Both gloved hands enter the field and establish a stable, cooperative working geometry: one instrument holds the curved needle while the other manipulates tissue and manages suture tails. Most commonly the left hand controls the needle driver/needle-holding clamp, approaching from the lateral or upper-left aspect of the wound, while the right hand holds fine tissue forceps (Adson-style/toothed pickup) coming from the opposite side. The instruments are positioned within 1–3 cm of the incision and the tips converge directly above the defect; hands routinely cross above the wound during needle transfer and suture handling. The operator grips the curved needle in the driver about mid-shaft or proximal third (near the body rather than the very tip), favoring a mid-shaft grasp that allows a controlled rotational arc.

Needle passes during these early frames are deliberate and conservatively deep—bites are typically superficial-to-intermediate in depth, engaging the dermal analogue of the pad to capture epidermal and dermal tissue for secure edge apposition. The non-needle hand uses toothed forceps to lift and slightly evert the opposite wound edge and to receive or steady the needle as it exits; this coordinated countertraction stabilizes tissue and reduces puckering. After each bite, the suture is pulled through and manipulated in preparation for knot tying; instrument switching and occasional use of a second clamp or scissors for suture tail control is observed. The overall pattern is serial placement of interrupted stitches, each placed adjacent to the last and progressed along the length of the slit.

Establishing a controlled rhythm (60–150 s)
As the case progresses the operator establishes a consistent rhythm. The left-hand needle driver repeatedly brings a curved needle in a controlled arc through one wound edge and then the opposite margin while the right-hand forceps evert and align tissues. The needle trajectory is predominantly perpendicular-to-oblique to the wound margin, driven in short arcs that follow the curvature of the needle. Needle grasping remains consistent: the driver holds the needle mid-body, allowing rotation through the dermis with steady control. The suture tail is managed actively with the non-needle instrument so that as each pass completes, the operator can draw suture tension to approximate edges before tying knots.

Hands remain close and cooperative: one instrument typically approaches from the superior-left quadrant while the other spans the inferior-right, and their tips meet over the incision. Instruments frequently cross above the lesion to transfer the needle or to tie. Throughout these frames the operator places additional interrupted stitches immediately adjacent to the previously secured row, progressing in a methodical fashion. Occasionally the operator holds suture tails or trims them between knots; small variations in instrument roles occur with alternating hands providing needle control versus tissue control, but the functional division—one instrument steering the needle, the other eversing the edge and managing suture—stays steady.

Working around the apex and superior aspects (150–240 s)
The operator focuses activity increasingly toward the superior and central portions of the slit. The needle driver often approaches from the left or upper-left and advances the needle tip across the wound toward the right/inferior edge, while the forceps from the right or lower-right provide counter-traction and receive the needle. This spatial relationship is consistent frame-to-frame: instruments converge within 1–3 cm and remain closely opposed across the wound plane to permit precise needle passage and immediate edge alignment.

Needle passes continue to capture dermal tissue with slight eversion of the epidermal margins at the knot line to promote edge inversion for epidermal contact. The operator repeatedly rotates the needle through tissue in the characteristic curved-needle arc and draws the suture through, then secures the stitch with a tied knot. Suture tails are routed away from the worksite toward the lower-right in several frames and are periodically trimmed after secure knot tying. Intermittent use of a hemostat or additional clamp for suture tail control is used as needed. This sequence—needle pass, suture retrieval, tensioning, knot tying, and trimming—is repeated in a serial pattern that closes the slit progressively from the existing anchored row inward along the wound line.

Mid-procedure refinement and repetitive technique (240–300 s)
Throughout the middle portion of the video the operator’s technique remains consistent and refined. The needle driver continues to maintain mid-shaft grasp on the curved needle; the operator uses shallow-to-moderate dermal bites aiming to align epidermal edges precisely. Tissue handling remains atraumatic in intent: the forceps lift and evert the edge to present dermis for capture and reduce inversion. Hands and instruments stay closely opposed—typically through a crossing pattern above the wound—to optimize control during needle passage and to make rapid transitions between needle delivery and suture management. The suture line is extended by placing another interrupted stitch adjacent to the prior knots; each stitch is tied before the next is cut and the next needle pass begun.

Occasionally, small variations are seen: at times the operator uses the right hand for the needle driver and the left for the forceps, or vice versa, depending on ergonomics and the bite being placed. The work proceeds in small increments—often at the superior-central segment of the incision—showing a disciplined, stepwise closure. The spatial choreography of approach vectors (needle driver above/left, forceps below/right, or the mirror of that arrangement) is recurrent and facilitates precise needle guidance through opposing wound edges.

Late-stage passes and suture management (300–330 s)
As the closure reaches later stages the operator places and secures additional stitches to complete the continuity of the closure. Needle control is firm and consistent: the needle driver frequently grips the needle near the swage or slightly distal depending on the pass, and the needle is rotated through full-thickness dermal bites with the forceps maintaining consistent eversion. The suture thread is drawn through and managed with the non-needle instrument prior to knot tying; sometimes a loop forms and is manipulated so that tension can be adjusted prior to tying.

In the penultimate frames there are sequences that show handling of suture tails, knot-tying maneuvers, and short periods where instruments cross directly above the wound to permit instrument exchange or suture trimming. The hands remain within a narrow working radius—generally 1–3 cm from the incision—so that fine motor control and visualization are optimized. Throughout, the operator pursues the same interrupted-stitch approach, placing successive discrete bites and securing them before advancing.

End state and final inspection (330 s and beyond)
The final frames show the wound with multiple completed interrupted sutures in place along its length. Knots and suture tails are visible; the wound edges are approximated with slight eversion at the knot lines—a common intentional eversion to compensate for epidermal inversion and to encourage proper epidermal-to-epidermal apposition during healing. In the very last frames the needle and instruments are not visible; the sutured line is left intact with tied knots and trimmed tails evident. On close inspection there is generally good alignment of opposing edges, with only minor gapping visible at a few stitch sites and subtle irregularities of eversion in places.

Technique fidelity, consistency, and minor deviations
Across the entire chronology the operator adheres to a repeatable interrupted-suture technique: curved-needle passes in a controlled arc, mid-shaft needle grip for stable rotation, forceps-mediated eversion and alignment, suture pull-through with immediate knot tying, and trimming of tails. Hands remain coordinated and close to the wound throughout, frequently crossing above the incision to facilitate needle transfer and knot manipulation. Instruments consistently converge at the bite site, with the needle driver advancing the needle from one side and the forceps providing counter-traction on the other.

A few frames present brief, apparent deviations or ambiguous cues—one sequence modestly resembles a continuous subcuticular motion and one reference notes mattress-style bites on an earlier pass. These occurrences do not change the overall practice recorded in the video: the net operative behavior is dominated by interrupted bites placed in series along the same line. Where the running or mattress-like descriptions appear, they can be interpreted as temporary variations in handling, needle orientation, or the visual effect of suture manipulation in tight frames rather than wholesale changes in closure strategy. In any case, the operator returns to and maintains the interrupted-stitch pattern for definitive closure.

Spatial choreography and hand evolution
From start to finish the operator organizes the field so that one hand controls needle trajectory and the other provides tissue manipulation and suture management. Early frames establish the orientation—left hand frequently holding the driver, right hand the forceps—with frequent role reversals as needed for ergonomics and specific bite orientation. Instruments repeatedly meet over the incision, within a narrow working radius of a few centimeters, and their tips often cross to allow secure needle delivery and efficient knot tying. As the sequence advances, the hands preserve this intimate working relationship; by the final frames the instruments are withdrawn and the completed sutures remain in place, with no hands visible over the wound.

Final appearance and practical considerations
The wound is closed by a contiguous sequence of interrupted stitches placed adjacent to one another along the vertical slit. Knots and tails are present and trimmed in places, and the edges are approximated with slight eversion at knot lines—an expected technique to optimize epidermal edge apposition. Small localized gapping and minor irregular eversion appear at a few stitch sites, representing subtle imperfections in edge apposition or tension distribution, but overall the closure is secure and cosmetically acceptable for a simulated dermal pad. No active needle handling is visible in the last frames, indicating the operator has completed the passes and secured the closure before withdrawing instruments from the field.

Summary
Throughout the recording the operator methodically closes the same right-sided vertical incision using a consistent interrupted-suture technique. Needle handling is controlled and repetitive—mid-shaft grasp of a curved needle, rotation through dermis in a cuffing arc—while the opposite hand elevates and everts tissue to achieve precise edge capture. Sutures are placed serially and tied in sequence, with suture tails managed and trimmed before proceeding. Hands and instruments remain closely opposed and frequently cross above the wound, coordinating needle passage, tissue control, and knot management. The final state shows the slit closed by a contiguous row of interrupted stitches with tied knots and trimmed tails; edges are well approximated with slight eversion and only minor residual gapping at selected stitch sites.
