COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on a single incision: the far‑right vertical slit on the synthetic pad. The other three parallel cuts remain untouched from start to finish. From the very beginning, the operator commits to closing this one wound with a series of discrete stitches, building a continuous line of simple interrupted sutures from the inferior end upward, with periodic tying and trimming before advancing to the next placement. The movements are deliberate and conservative, with frequent pauses to reload the needle, manage the suture line, and ensure perpendicular orientation and symmetric depth across the wound edges.

The work opens at the distal (inferior) end of the right‑most slit. The left hand brings in a needle driver while the right hand positions Adson‑type tissue forceps at the near/right wound edge. The needle is loaded in the driver across the proximal third of its curvature and presented almost perfectly perpendicular to the skin surface. The right‑hand forceps lift and gently evert the near/right lip to present the dermal margin. With a controlled wrist rotation, the needle tip engages a small, consistent setback from the edge, passing through the right lip and aiming across to exit through the opposing left lip at a matching depth and distance. The first bites are taken at the lower end of the slit, with the suture thread draped away from the field to keep it clear of the working zone.

In these early moments, the operator cycles between brief sequences of needle loading and decisive needle passage. The driver and forceps oppose each other across the wound: the driver superior/left of the target and the forceps inferior/right. The curvature is oriented for a right‑to‑left trajectory and followed with short, controlled forearm rotations. When the needle tip emerges, the forceps guide it through and the stitch is pulled to length. After passage at the inferior end, a loop and free tail appear, signaling preparation for knot tying. The operator then transitions to an instrument tie, using the driver to form successive loops while the other hand tensions the free end. Throughout this tying phase, the needle remains parked safely in the jaws of the driver, kept out of the tissue while the knot is seated on the epidermal surface at the distal end. Scissors are introduced from the left to trim the tails once the knot is secured, and the inferior stitch is finalized and tidied before moving on.

As the sequence continues, the operator resumes placement just above the initial knot, maintaining a consistent technique. The needle is repeatedly reloaded at the proximal‑to‑middle third of its arc so that each entry is perpendicular to the skin surface. The right‑hand forceps pick up and evert the near/right lip, and the driver delivers a rotational pass across to the far lip. The spacing of the bites is small and even, echoing the previous stitch. Tactically, the non‑dominant hand settles into a pattern of counter‑traction and edge presentation, while the dominant hand focuses on controlled arcs with the needle driver. After each pass, the driver regrips the needle to guide extraction and pull the suture through without crushing the synthetic skin.

This rhythm—bite, pull‑through, tie, trim—repeats as the closure progresses superiorly along the same slit. New stitches are placed just proximal to prior knots, the suture is tensioned to approximate the edges, and throws are completed using instrument ties. At times, the operator introduces a second needle driver to partner with the first for tying, switching briefly from forceps to driver to cinch a knot squarely over the center of the wound line. On multiple occasions, scissors return to trim tails once the knot is set, leaving short, neatly cut ends that do not impinge on subsequent passes. The suture strand is generally managed off to the right of the pad to avoid tangles; in some segments the free strand crosses the pad centrally or drapes leftward, but it is consistently kept clear of the needle’s path when the next pass is taken.

Between active bites, there are preparation intervals. In these, the driver hovers over the wound while the forceps either hold the edge lightly or reposition the needle on the driver. The needle is often clamped two‑thirds from the tip or around the proximal third of the body—both grasps are used—with constant attention to restoring a perpendicular approach to the skin before each entry. During these pauses, forceps sometimes control the needle and suture rather than directly lifting the skin, especially when the operator is reorienting for the next bite. Despite these brief departures from ideal counter‑traction, the actual needle entries are consistently perpendicular, and the bites appear symmetric across the incision, with slight eversion achieved whenever the forceps elevate the margin.

After the initial series of stitches in the inferior portion, tying and trimming consolidate the early work. With that foundation in place, the closure advances into the mid‑portion of the slit. The operator continues to work from the pad’s right edge and superior side, triangulating the instruments across the wound: driver above and just left of the entry site, forceps lateral/right at the margin. The free suture is intermittently pulled aside to remove slack and keep the field orderly. On some passes, there is minimal edge lifting and the forceps are used mainly to steady the needle during reloading. Even so, the subsequent penetrations remain deliberate, following the needle’s curvature in a controlled arc through one lip and across to the opposite edge at matched depth.

As the line of closure rises, new stitches appear adjacent to the previous row, and multiple cycles of instrument tying are completed. The operator occasionally returns to a recently placed stitch to tighten it a bit more, to add throws, or to trim tails. At several points, scissors enter to cut the tails immediately after a knot is seated, indicating that each interrupted stitch is completed before attention shifts to the next. In other intervals, no knot tying is shown even though a bite has been taken; here the emphasis is on successive needle passage and pull‑through, with tying deferred to the subsequent moments.

In the mid‑to‑upper third of the incision, the technique remains steady. The needle driver is typically centered over the wound, the forceps oppose from the right edge, and the suture strand trails away from the working zone, sometimes across the central pad. The driver’s jaws grasp the needle at a consistent point on the body to maintain leverage without deforming the curvature. The operator’s wrist performs the arc through the dermis, and the forceps retrieve the needle tip as it emerges. When the wound edges are elevated, slight eversion is apparent and the bites sit a few millimeters from the margin with near symmetric depth. When forceps are not engaged in counter‑traction, the entries are still perpendicular and carefully placed, relying on the existing stitches below to maintain approximation and alignment.

There is a brief detour back to the lower portion of the wound. After building up the row higher on the slit, the operator returns to the distal segment, working just inferior to the more recent knots. With the needle reloaded in the driver and the forceps lifting the margin, another controlled bite is taken to address spacing at the bottom end. This revisiting appears to refine closure or to fill a gap below, after which the operator resumes working superiorly again. This back‑and‑forth does not break the continuity of the repair; rather, it ensures uniform spacing and approximation along the entire length as the series of interrupted sutures accumulates.

As the closure nears the superior end, preparation frames alternate with decisive placement frames. In the preparation moments, the needle is aligned perpendicularly, often at the proximal third, with the tip aimed into the right wound edge at the top of the slit. The forceps stabilize and evert the lateral edge, and the needle driver stands just medial to that edge, ready to engage. Subsequent frames show the needle advancing through the right lip and sweeping across to the left in a controlled arc, after which the suture is drawn through. The spacing and pattern at the superior segment continue to match the earlier stitches: small, evenly spaced bites with slight eversion where the edge is lifted. Knots are again tied with instrument throws, sometimes using a second driver, and scissors trim the tails. The hands remain close and coordinated, straddling the incision without encroaching on the other cuts on the pad.

Throughout, the spatial choreography is consistent. The driver operates just above or slightly medial to the wound, while the forceps sit lateral to the edge being entered. Instruments cross over the wound axis during needle passage and while setting loops for ties, but the crossing is controlled and always centered over the rightmost incision. The suture strand is frequently moved out of the way—often to the operator’s right, occasionally laid across the center or to the left—but it is kept clear of the needle’s arc when a bite is taken. There are moments of instrument hovering over the wound without purchase, brief withdrawals of both hands from the field, and a few instances where tissue eversion is minimal, but these pauses and minor deficiencies do not alter the steady development of the repair along this one slit.

Near the end of the sequence, the operator places and ties additional stitches at the superior end, then trims tails. The wound is now lined with a run of closely spaced, discrete knots from the lower third up toward the top. The process then slows. Instruments are occasionally positioned above the wound without engaging tissue. At one point, a card is placed over the center of the pad without covering the right margin, leaving the sutured wound visible. In the final moments, a needle driver hovers at the upper right without contacting the incision, and a length of suture lies slack across the left side of the board. No further bites, throws, or knot tying occur. The already placed stitches along the vertical incision remain undisturbed, and the two central incisions and the leftmost incision have never been touched.

By the conclusion, the right‑most slit has been substantially closed with a series of simple interrupted stitches beginning at the distal end and extending superiorly. Each stitch was passed with the needle presented perpendicular to the skin surface, the curvature followed through both edges, and the suture drawn through before instrument tying and tail trimming. Forceps were used frequently to lift and evert edges for needle entry and exit, yielding slight eversion and consistent approximation where engaged; on other passes, minimal eversion was performed, but entry remained perpendicular and bites symmetric. The hand positions evolved fluidly—predominantly left hand on the needle driver and right hand on forceps, with occasional role reversals during reloading or when using a second driver for instrument ties. Spatially, the tools triangulated over the same wound throughout, with careful suture management to keep the line clear.

The final state shows the right‑most incision approximated along its length by a neat row of tied, trimmed interrupted sutures from the lower portion upward, with additional stitches seated near the superior end. The edges are held together with slight eversion where the forceps lifted the margins, and the wound line exhibits a consistent, methodical pattern of placement. No further passes are attempted in the closing moments, and the closure appears complete or very near completion at the superior extent, while all other incisions remain unused.
