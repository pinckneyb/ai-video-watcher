COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire sequence takes place on a three‑slit silicone suture pad, but every maneuver is concentrated on the single, central vertical wound. This is the widest cut on the block and runs superior–inferior in the midline. The two lateral parallel slits remain untouched throughout. The operator works in a classic two‑handed fashion: the left hand most often carries Adson/toothed forceps to evert and stabilize the far (patient’s left) edge, while the right hand holds a needle driver to control the needle and, later, to perform instrument ties. Straight scissors are present off to the side and are only brought in at the very end to trim tails.

The opening moments focus on setting up the very first stitch at the inferior end of the midline incision. With the wound gaping, the left forceps grasp and gently evert the near dermal edge to present a robust bite of tissue. The right hand has already loaded a curved needle in the driver—secured on the body roughly two‑thirds from the tip (at times slightly closer to the swage), with the curve oriented so the needle can follow a smooth arc. The driver brings the needle to the near/inferior edge and squares its tip to the epidermal‑dermal junction at close to 90 degrees. This is deliberate, classic setup: eversion in the left hand, perpendicular approach in the right, and good visualization of the entry point. The segment shows preparation and initiation; the needle is positioned, but no cross‑wound passage or knot is completed in these first moments.

As the sequence moves on, the operator begins driving and then tying the first stitch. After an initial bite is taken, the left hand transitions from forceps control to managing the short tail to enable instrument tying. The right hand, still wielding the driver, uses the standard instrument‑tie choreography—wrapping loops, reaching through to grasp the short end, and starting to lay down a throw. The knot is not yet fully seated, but the choreography makes clear that a first stitch has been passed and tying is underway. The hands work opposite each other across the incision, and tension is applied in alternating directions to begin aligning the wound edges over the bite.

The camera then lingers over the lower third of the central slit as the right hand repositions, holding the needle driver while the left hand alternates between light tissue control and shepherding the free suture end. The driver is angled perpendicular to the skin; the working plan is still for a simple interrupted closure. The tip is brought to the right/lower lip, preparing entry. In the next sequence the forehand pass is made: from the right edge across the wound toward the left. The left forceps lift and evert the left edge to present a solid, even depth of dermis, and the needle follows its curve through the far edge and out to the left. The left hand may even “receive” the needle as it emerges, an efficient motion that protects the tissue and controls the needle tip. As the needle exits, the suture is drawn partway through and tensioned just enough to approximate the edges transiently without strangulation. At this point there is still no completed knot—only a stitch passed through both edges and managed to keep the field clear.

With that first pass complete, knot tying begins in earnest. The right hand uses the needle holder to grasp the suture near the needle end and build loops; the left forceps maintain gentle eversion of the left edge while also helping manage the tail. This instrument‑tie sequence forms and cinches the first throw across the midline incision. The needle itself is not being used to take new bites in these moments; it remains attached to the suture but functions essentially as a weight on the line while the throw is laid and begun. Care is taken to tighten the throw down perpendicular to the wound so that the knot will sit centered over the incision and the strand will lie orthogonal to the wound edges.

The next stretch of footage shows additional needle passage at the mid‑incision. The curved needle is again held at the mid‑to‑proximal third of its body, perpendicular to the jaws, with deliberate regripping to maintain the ninety‑degree approach as the tip pierces the right wound lip and advances in a controlled arc. The left forceps continue to evert the left lip, both to guide the needle exit and to emphasize good edge eversion—a hallmark of sound epidermal closure. The thread is then lifted up and out of the way, clearing loops from the visual field, and any slack is gathered. No knot is tied yet in this mid‑incision pass; the stitches are still being placed and adjusted.

By the time the camera returns to the midline, one simple interrupted stitch is clearly visible spanning the lower‑mid portion of the incision. This change is evident because the description notes a single completed interrupted stitch present on the central slit. With that first stitch seated and its knot visible over the midline, the operator begins planning the next bite superior to the first, moving up the wound to continue closure in a simple interrupted pattern. The left hand, still holding Adsons, takes small, atraumatic bites with just the tips to lift the dermis. The right hand reloads the needle—again about two‑thirds from the tip—and brings it in perpendicular to the skin. As the second pass begins, thread management becomes more deliberate: the previously placed stitch is tensioned gently to maintain approximation, and the new loop is kept from tangling with the existing knot.

In this middle portion of the procedure, the technique alternates between instrument‑driven and hand‑driven tying, depending on access and the operator’s chosen pace. Early in this segment, the right hand uses the needle holder to wrap and pull for knot tying at the stitch that has just been placed in the mid‑portion. The throw is seated centrally, and then attention immediately shifts slightly cranially to initiate the next stitch just superior to that first knot. Loops are formed and positioned, but that second stitch is not yet fully secured when the sequence ends. The count of completed sutures remains one.

The next set of images narrows in on the superior aspect of the same midline slit. The left forceps now work just left and slightly above the previously placed knot, everting the superior edges. The right hand, with the driver, moves to the patient’s right side near the superior portion and aligns the needle tip to enter the right superior wound edge. The needle is grasped on its body about two‑thirds from the swage and held near‑perpendicular to the skin. The driver repositions as needed so the arc of the needle will carry across the slit to the opposite side while preserving a right‑angle entry. The strand from the earlier knot is managed to keep the field clean. This is the deliberate start of another simple interrupted stitch at the top of the working field.

At this point, rather than continuing immediately with more needle passes, the operator consolidates the work with tying maneuvers. With the edges at the superior portion already lying close from earlier traction, the right hand uses the needle holder to grasp the suture and perform instrument ties, while the left hand, still with Adsons, stabilizes without taking new bites. No fresh passes are made through tissue in this brief interlude; the focus is on setting the knot and snugging the edges. The wound looks increasingly well‑approximated in this superior segment as the throws are laid and tightened.

The next sequences shift from instrument ties to hand ties. The needle driver is briefly set down on the field while both hands coordinate to complete the knot over the central slit. The left hand maintains the “post”—the standing end on the left side of the slit where the needle remains attached—while the right hand manipulates the free end from the right. The right hand crosses over the incision to form loops, then each hand alternates pulling in opposite directions to seat the throws squarely and to center the knot over the wound. There is no new needle penetration of tissue in these hand‑tying segments; the work is purely about securing what has been passed. As the throws are tightened, the stitch is oriented perpendicular to the incision, and the knot lies centered. By the end of this phase, one completed simple interrupted stitch is visible across the midline wound.

With one stitch secured and the wound now partially approximated, the operator returns to the driver to add another stitch. At the outset of this final phase, a single knot can be seen near the upper third of the central slit, reflecting the most recently secured throw’s final resting position after cinching and centration. The right hand grasps the needle on its body—again at the reliable two‑thirds from the tip position—and presents it at a right angle to the dermis. The left hand manages the free suture end and provides gentle traction to keep the plane of the wound flat. The needle is driven in a controlled curved motion across the midline at a site in the middle region of the incision, chosen to complement the existing upper stitch and to further close the gap. After passage, the driver is used for instrument ties: the right hand wraps the suture over the driver’s jaws, reaches through to grasp the short tail, and pulls the throw down. The hands alternate tension across the line of the wound to snug the knot, ensuring it sits flat and centrally over the incision. As the throws are completed and the knot is secured, straight scissors are finally brought in from the right to trim the tails neatly. The closure now has two discrete simple interrupted sutures spanning the midline slit.

Throughout the case, the hand positions relative to the wound are consistent and disciplined. The left hand, when using forceps, remains just left of the targeted edge and slightly inferior or superior depending on the bite being taken, always used to lift and evert the tissue rather than crush it. During tying, the left hand alternates between holding the standing end for instrument ties and acting as the post during hand ties; in the hand‑tying scenes, it also steadies the tissue without forceps to help center the knot. The right hand is the workhorse for needle passage and knot formation, approaching each planned entry point at a near‑perpendicular angle and following the curvature of the needle through the tissue with controlled wrist rotation. The driver crosses over the incision during both needle passage and instrument‑tie throws, and then retreats to allow the hands to pull in alternating directions to seat the knot squarely. There are moments when the needle is attached but not grasped—lying off to the left while hand ties are performed—and moments when both driver and scissors rest idle above the field. The scissors appear only at the end for tail trimming, emphasizing economy of motion and tool use.

The technique evolves predictably as the operator progresses from initial passes to securing throws. Early on, needle handling is the focus: loading the needle on the body at two‑thirds from the tip for optimal control, bringing it to the skin at 90 degrees, using the left forceps to evert the far edge, and regripping as needed to maintain the correct angle. As the first stitch crosses from the right edge to the left and is drawn through, the surgeon is careful to keep the suture lifted superiorly to avoid tangling and to maintain a clear field. Instrument ties are used first, laying the initial throws with the needle driver, then the sequence shifts to hand ties to fine‑tune the knot’s position and to snug it down centrally over the incision. When the second stitch is started at the superior aspect, the same principles apply: proper eversion with forceps, perpendicular entry from the right edge, and careful passage of the needle along its curve to the opposite side with minimal tissue trauma. Tying again alternates between instrument and hand techniques as access and precision demand. Across all tying phases, the ends are drawn in opposing directions along the line of the wound to seat the knot, then repositioned to lie flat and perpendicular to the incision so the strands span orthogonally across the slit.

Spatially, the hands and instruments maintain an opposing, balanced relationship over the midline slit. For needle passage, the right hand is on the patient’s right side of the incision, the left hand on the patient’s left; the driver crosses the wound while the left forceps counter‑traction and present the tissue. During tying, the hands often cross the midline as loops are made, then separate to pull in opposite directions to snug each throw. Superiorly, the same pattern is mirrored: the left forceps stay just left and slightly superior to the entry site, while the right driver approaches from the right, tips aiming across the slit. When both hands tie without instruments, the needle driver is laid on the field and both hands move closer to the midline, grabbing the ends and alternating the lead to ensure a flat, square knot.

The order of closure along the wound follows a simple interrupted pattern. It begins with the inferior/mid portion as the first target for a bite, transitions to tying and securing that stitch so that one knot is visible over the wound, and then moves cranially to place a second stitch at the superior region before returning to the middle to add another stitch that harmonizes with the already‑placed knot. Each pass is oriented to keep the suture orthogonal to the incision, each knot is centered, and eversion is preserved at every step. The lateral slits never enter the field of action and remain untouched, underscoring that all work is concentrated on a single midline incision.

Suture progression and counting are clear across time. At the beginning there are no completed stitches; the first several sequences show setup, passage, and early tying without any knots fully seated. By the time the needle passes at mid‑incision are complete, one stitch is eventually tied and visible across the midline—this is evident when a single completed interrupted stitch is noted spanning the central slit. The subsequent segments show tying maneuvers on that stitch (including both instrument and hand ties) with no additional bites taken, keeping the count at one. Only in the final segment does a new simple interrupted stitch get added in the middle region and fully tied, after which the scissors are used to trim the ends. At that point the wound bears two discrete simple interrupted sutures.

Mandatory suture count verification:
- Total number of completed sutures visible at the end: 2. The last frames show two simple interrupted stitches on the central vertical incision, with the second knot secured and the tails trimmed.
- Progression: The count rises from 0 during the early setup and passage sequences, to 1 once the first stitch is tied and the knot centered over the midline. It remains at 1 through the intervening tying sequences. In the final passage and tying sequence, a second stitch is placed and secured, increasing the total to 2.
- Final state: The central midline slit is partially closed with two perpendicular simple interrupted sutures—one seated nearer the upper third and another in the middle region—knots centered over the incision, tails trimmed. The lateral slits remain untouched.

This stepwise, methodical approach—precise needle handling at right angles, consistent edge eversion with forceps, alternation between instrument and hand ties to seat knots accurately, and careful suture management to keep the field clear—produces a clean partial closure of the central incision with exactly two completed simple interrupted sutures evident by the end.
