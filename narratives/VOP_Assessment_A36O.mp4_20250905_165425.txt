Pattern: Simple Interrupted

1. Perpendicular needle passes: The needle was consistently loaded and driven at a true right angle, following its curvature with symmetric depth and controlled tip capture, minimizing shear. Minor pre-entry micro‑adjustments remain to streamline, but execution of the passes themselves is square and reliable. 4/5 proficient

2. Gentle tissue handling: Forceps use was deliberate and light, presenting and everting the edge without crushing and receiving the needle just behind the tip to protect tissue. This reflects atraumatic technique with precise, minimal grasps. 4/5 proficient

3. Square, secure knots: The instrument tie was initiated with correct hand roles, controlled tension on the standing part, and efficient loop retrieval. Because only the initial throw is demonstrated without completed alternating throws or final lay, this meets but does not exceed standard for knot security. 3/5 competent

4. Appropriate approximation/tension: Symmetric, perpendicular bites were taken, yet the sequence stops before a completed tie brings the edges together to demonstrate coaptation or blanching. Without a shown final laydown, tension control is not established to standard. 2/5 developing

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm): Only isolated stitches were initiated without a series of completed knots, so a uniform inter-suture interval along the line is not demonstrated. Spacing performance is therefore below standard for a completed interrupted closure. 2/5 developing

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable): The edges are purposefully everted during presentation and passage, but no finished stitch is shown maintaining that profile after tying. Without a demonstrated final tissue lie, eversion performance is scored below standard. 2/5 developing

7. Economy of time and motion: The field stayed organized with suture kept off the wound and hands coordinated within a consistent working triangle, reflecting good discipline. Frequent micro‑regrips and ratchet toggling before committing to each bite slow the cadence and temper overall efficiency. 3/5 competent

Summative assessment:
This performance shows a disciplined, repeatable cadence with precise loading, perpendicular driving, and controlled tip capture, supported by clean suture management and protected visualization. Handedness is well coordinated: the dominant hand follows the needle’s arc while the non‑dominant hand provides steady countertraction and reliable tip reception, conveying calm control and safety.

The tempo is overly cautious, with repeated micro‑adjustments and ratchet toggling that lengthen setup and invite fatigue; consolidate grips, commit earlier to entry, and reduce regrips to improve flow. Close the loop: complete instrument ties with alternating, flat throws, then demonstrate edge coaptation, maintained eversion, and consistent spacing across multiple placed stitches to prove reproducible closure. The fundamentals are solid; now translate precision into efficient, complete suturing that shows the finished product.
