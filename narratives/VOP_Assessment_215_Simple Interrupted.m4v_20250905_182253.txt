Pattern: Simple Interrupted

RUBRIC ASSESSMENT:
1) Perpendicular needle passes: Entries are consistently perpendicular with symmetric depth, and the arc is wrist-driven to minimize shear. Completing some passes across both edges in one continuous sweep introduces a small risk of exit-angle drift, so this is excellent but not flawless. Score: 4
