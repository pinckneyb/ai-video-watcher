COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a focused, methodical closure of a single vertical skin incision located slightly left of center on the practice skin pad. Over the entire recording the operator works this same linear defect, progressively placing additional stitches along its length and advancing closure toward the superior segment. The technique throughout is a conventional epidermal/dermal approximation using a curved, swaged needle and monofilament suture, with the dominant hand operating the needle driver and the nondominant hand providing precise tissue control with fine forceps or fingertip stabilization.

Early approach and initial bites (0–120 s)
From the first frames the incision is a short vertical slit in the central-left zone of the pad. Both hands enter the field in close proximity to the wound. The needle driver is routinely presented from above or from the operator’s left/superior quadrant, holding the curved needle roughly at mid‑shaft to two‑thirds toward the swage; the grip location shifts subtly over time (mid‑body at some passes, nearer the swage at others) but consistently allows rotational control of the needle’s arc. The free hand uses toothed or Adson-style forceps or simply fingertips to grasp, tent, and evert the near wound edge, providing counter‑traction as the driver advances the needle through the opposite margin.

Passes are taken with controlled, perpendicular-to-oblique trajectories. Bites are small and superficial in most instances — dermal/epidermal purchase only — and focused about a few millimeters from the wound edge to achieve eversion and close apposition without undue tension. The operator repeatedly rotates the wrist to follow the needle curve through tissue, and the driver is generally locked to secure the needle during passage. Suture tails are managed with fingertip control; the assistant-like manipulations seen are integral to pulling the suture through and preparing for the next throw.

Progressing along the incision (120–240 s)
As the procedure advances, sutures are placed sequentially from the region adjacent to existing closures and progressed along the incision toward the superior or lateral end. Hands remain tightly coordinated, typically within a few centimeters of each other, assuming a pincher configuration: needle driver above or slightly lateral to the incision and forceps or fingers opposing on the near edge. The needle is frequently grasped at a consistent mid-to-proximal shaft position to maximize control; tip grasps are avoided to reduce risk of bending or breaking the needle.

Throughout this phase the operator emphasizes even spacing and short stitch intervals. Each stitch is passed through one edge, drawn through, and then passed through the opposing edge with the free hand providing precise edge eversion so that knots, when tightened, will produce slightly everted, edge‑to‑edge apposition. Some frames show the addition of deeper or intermediate passes when the wound geometry demands — for example, when an undermined pocket is present the operator briefly places a deeper approximation stitch to re‑approximate the wound base before resuming superficial interrupted closure. This demonstrates attention to layered closure principles even though the principal emphasis remains on epidermal/dermal interrupted stitches.

Hand and instrument dynamics remain consistent: the needle driver comes down from the top or upper‑left quadrant, the forceps approach from the opposite side just lateral to the bite, and instrument tips are maintained close to the skin surface. The operator alternates slight adjustments in grip and angle to accommodate local tissue thickness and the curve of the needle, but the overall motion — drive, rotate, retrieve, and prepare next throw — is repeated in a steady cadence.

Mid‑procedure refinement and suture management (240–330 s)
Midway through the recording the operator concentrates work at a superior open segment of the same left‑of‑center incision. Sutures already placed inferiorly act as guides for alignment; the operator consistently places new stitches immediately adjacent to these to maintain even spacing and consistent tension across the closure. The free hand is sometimes seen to use only fingertip control rather than forceps, indicating confidence and precise manual dexterity when manipulating suture tails and wound edges.

Needle handling shows only minor variation: in many passes the needle is grasped near the swage for increased control and driven through the dermis in a perpendicular arc; elsewhere the needle is held a little more distal when a slightly more oblique purchase is needed. The driver is intermittently locked during passage, with the trajectory directed from lateral-to-medial (or vice versa) depending on the bite orientation. The operator pulls the suture through carefully to avoid over‑tightening while preserving eversion.

There is evidence of minor instrument exchange and intermittent assistance: a previously placed instrument-clamped suture may be held adjacent to the wound while the operator completes a neighboring bite, and on a few frames the nondominant hand is observed using a hemostat or clamp to secure suture tails temporarily. These maneuvers streamline the workflow and allow uninterrupted progression of the closure line.

Later-stage technique and a notable observed variation (330–389 s)
As the work reaches the superior terminus of the incision, the operator maintains the same disciplined approach: the needle driver remains above the wound, the non‑dominant hand provides counter‑traction and everted alignment, and bites are kept short and superficial to deliver a cosmetically appropriate edge apposition. Knots are tied sequentially as each stitch is completed, with visible secured interrupted knots forming a continuous line inferior to the active bite site.

In one segment of the recording the suture tail appears to be advanced in a single long strand and is described in some frames as being drawn in a continuous fashion; at one point this is characterized as a running/subcuticular‑style progression. That observation departs from the dominant pattern of isolated interrupted passes evident throughout the rest of the sequence. Given the overall consistency of interrupted technique in the overwhelming majority of frames — including repeated individual needle passes, retrievals, and knot preparations — this instance is best interpreted as a transient appearance of a long suture tail or the operator temporarily manipulating an extended suture limb during knot preparation rather than a deliberate conversion to a continuous closure. Regardless, the primary technique practiced and reinforced across the procedure remains simple interrupted skin sutures placed sequentially along the same incision.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships across the case
Throughout the entire case both hands stay in close spatial relationship to the incision, adapting only minimally as closure progresses along the wound. At the outset the needle driver generally approaches from the superior or upper‑left quadrant and remains there for most bites; the free hand alternates between toothed forceps, Adson pickups, or fingers depending on the need for fine control. As the operator moves along the incision, the driver and forceps shift incrementally with the working bite — the driver always slightly cranial and slightly lateral to the current bite with the forceps opposing medially or caudally. Hands routinely operate within 1–4 cm of each other, crossing the wound axis with controlled motions when necessary.

Over time the operator relies increasingly on fingertip manipulation for minor adjustments, transitioning from forceps to fingers when knot tying or tail management requires delicate control. Instrument orientation is steady: needle driver jaws angled to allow rotation along the curve, forceps tips directed to lift and evert the near edge. When deeper or intermediate bites are required (for example, to address undermining) the pattern briefly incorporates a slightly deeper purchase with the same hand positions, then returns to superficial interrupted passes.

Technique consistency and evolution
The suturing technique stays remarkably consistent: the operator favors small, superficial dermal/epidermal bites taken perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin surface, with slight margin eversion intentionally created and preserved by the forceps. Needle control is deliberate — mid‑shaft to near‑swage grasp with locked driver during passage — providing a controlled arc and minimizing tissue drag. Knot tying follows each pass; the operator prepares and secures the suture before advancing to the next adjacent bite, producing an evenly approximated line.

Although there is one moment that could be read as a continuous pass or long suture manipulation, this is an outlier within the sequence and does not alter the overall pattern of placing, retrieving, and knotting discrete interrupted stitches along the wound. The occasional deeper or intermediate stitch placed earlier in the sequence illustrates attention to layered closure principles where local wound geometry requires it; otherwise the operator maintains a surface interrupted closure technique consistent with standard skin approximation.

Final state of closure
By the end of the recording the incision is fully approximated along its length. A neat row of secured interrupted knots lies along one side of the wound, and the skin edges are well opposed with slight eversion preserved. Bites are evenly spaced and shallow—engaging epidermis and superficial dermis—without overt tension or puckering of adjacent tissue. Instrument positions at conclusion reflect a final pass at the superior terminus with the needle either just withdrawn or being prepared for the last throw; suture tails are under control, and previous frames indicate readiness for final trimming.

Overall, the operator demonstrates a controlled, reproducible interrupted suturing technique on a single left‑of‑center vertical incision: consistent needle handling, close instrument coordination, careful tissue eversion, and sequential knot placement that result in a clean, well‑approximated skin closure. A brief interval in the record suggests manipulation of an extended suture limb that superficially resembles a continuous pass, but the dominant and persistent practice throughout the procedure remains placement of individual interrupted stitches to complete secure and cosmetically favorable closure.
