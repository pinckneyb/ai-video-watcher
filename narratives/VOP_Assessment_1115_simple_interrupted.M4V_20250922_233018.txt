COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session unfolds on a synthetic skin pad bearing several parallel slits, but all operative attention remains concentrated on a single straight linear wound just right of center on the field. This line is worked from its middle outward in a methodical, simple interrupted fashion. Other nearby slits remain background landmarks that are not actively engaged by the instruments. From the outset, the operator establishes a stable bimanual workflow and returns to it repeatedly: one hand controls a needle driver near the wound axis, while the other manages Adson-style tissue forceps or the suture limbs as needed for edge control, loop formation, and knot security. The needle is consistently grasped at approximately the proximal third to mid-body, oriented perpendicular to the skin surface, and driven in a smooth, controlled arc. When not passing tissue, it is parked safely in the driver while instrument ties are thrown.

The opening moments show a stitch already traversing the target line, with the driver centered over the cut and the forceps presenting either the short limb or the wound edge. Instrument ties are thrown over the driver, the suture is cinched down carefully, and the knot is seated directly over the midline without lateral migration. The right hand maintains light traction on the short end to post the knot while the driver executes sequential throws; tension is applied symmetrically so the edges coapt without strangulation. Even at this early stage the operator shows consistent needle loading—jaws perpendicular to the curve, grasp near the proximal third—and careful edge handling. The forceps lift just the dermal margin when needed to evert and stabilize, avoiding deep crushing. After the initial knot is secured, the driver is reloaded with the needle, the arc is adjusted to enter perpendicularly, and the thread is laid out laterally to keep the field clear for the next pass.

With this foundation, the work proceeds in steady cycles of pass, pull-through, tie, and trim. The driver hovers above the right-of-center wound; the forceps oppose it across the slit to present each edge just ahead of the needle tip. When the operator prepares a bite, the needle is aligned perpendicular to the incision line, the near edge is gently tented, and a shallow, symmetric bite is taken a few millimeters from the margin. The needle follows its curvature across the gap and exits the opposite edge at a mirror-image distance. The suture is drawn through smoothly, slack is managed to avoid tangles, and the two limbs are equalized. Frequently the forceps switch roles between tissue control and suture presentation; the right hand will steady the needle or the short limb while the left hand with the driver forms loops for instrument ties. When knots are thrown, the driver and the assisting hand alternately cross the midline to lay down square, flat throws that sit directly over the incision; then they separate to apply even tension, seating the knot without distorting the tissue. Scissors enter parallel to the wound to trim tails close to the knot when a stitch is finished, and then withdraw so the driver can reload the needle for the next placement.

In some sequences, no new bite is taken; instead, the surgeon uses the pause to optimize needle loading and spatial setup. The needle is held at the proximal third to midpoint with the driver jaws perpendicular to the curve, and the arc is oriented for a forehand sweep across the slit. The suture tail is drawn out of the operative field and laid to the right, preventing entanglement. Both hands remain a few centimeters above the cut, superior to the working zone, with the driver centered over the line and the assisting hand hovering contralateral—ready to evert a wound edge or present the short limb for a tie. These preparation phases keep the field organized and shorten the path to a precise, perpendicular entry angle for the next bite.

As closure advances along the same line, the technique remains consistent. When the operator transitions from tying to driving again, the forceps gently grasp the dermal edge at the bite site, just enough to present and evert the tissue. The needle follows a smooth semicircular path; the depth and distance from the edge remain modest and symmetric, reinforcing eversion and minimizing dead space. After passage, the needle is either regripped to advance it safely out of the tissue or parked in the driver while suture limbs are organized. The operator often stabilizes the wound with the forceps while the driver manipulates the suture to form the first throw, then the roles may reverse for subsequent throws, ensuring square knots that stack compactly over the incision. Where stitches have already been placed, the edges are well approximated with minimal gapping, and new ties are seated adjacent to prior knots without capturing excess tissue.

Midway through the procedure, several frames highlight the knot management phase over the central portion of the same wound. The needle is attached to the working limb but kept out of the tissue while the driver tip helps form and guide loops; the assisting hand brings the short end across the line to the driver, which then grasps it, pulls it through, and seats the throw. This repeats for multiple throws per stitch. The operator maintains short working distances, bracing on the pad with the ulnar border or instrument tips to prevent drift. When trimming tails, the scissors approach along the axis of the wound; the other hand steadies the knot so the cut is precise and the knot isn’t lifted off the tissue. These segments reinforce the methodical, instrument-tie-driven approach used throughout, always centered on the same right-of-center line.

As work progresses toward the superior end of the wound, the driver operates just above the most recently placed knot, and the forceps work slightly inferior and lateral, controlling the edge and presenting the suture tail. A knot is completed at the superior end of the existing stitch line, and the needle is repositioned for another bite on the same incision. The handling remains gentle: eversion is maintained with minimal crush, and each bite mirrors the last in alignment and spacing. Short sequences show snugging and final seating of knots followed by immediate cutting of tails close to the knot. On reloading, the operator often extracts slack from the long limb and clears the field before reorienting the needle perpendicular to the edge for the next pass.

Several sequences depict the needle actually penetrating and traversing the wound edges, emphasizing the technique’s consistency. The driver introduces the needle perpendicular to the surface, arcs through the near edge, advances across the gap, and exits the far edge at a matching distance. The assisting hand tracks just ahead of the needle, lightly countering tissue motion and guiding the exit. Once through, the suture is drawn to equalize limb lengths, leaving a small working distance for knot formation. The first throw brings the edges together; subsequent throws secure the approximation. Even when the video shows only part of this cycle—a pass beginning without completion, or a tie underway without the initial pass—the choreography of the two hands remains the same: driver centered over the line, forceps opposing across the gap, suture limbs controlled and kept out of the wound until needed.

Near the latter stages, an entire stitch cycle—pass, tie, and tail trimming—occurs over the same line. After the knot is cut, the needle is reloaded immediately, signaling the intent to continue along that wound. In another contiguous segment, instrument tying is again highlighted: the driver works superior and central; the forceps and suture tail are controlled on the operator’s right. Multiple throws are cinched down and seated, with the tail brought across the wound for each throw and retrieved by the driver. The result is a run of compact, square knots aligned over the incision line, edges coapted with slight eversion, and tails trimmed close.

At one point the field perspective shifts and the primary line briefly appears horizontal relative to the frame. The operative behavior, however, is entirely unchanged: the same pair of instruments straddle the same wound axis; the needle is grasped two-thirds from the tip in the driver, oriented perpendicular to the surface; the forceps gently evert each edge during entry and exit; and a new simple interrupted stitch is placed and tied before scissors trim the tails. The pad orientation or camera angle may create the impression of a different cut, but the technique, spacing, and the ongoing series of knots make clear that the surgeon remains on the same line of closure. Immediately afterward, the view returns to the familiar orientation with the driver and assisting hand positioned above the superior aspect of the same incision, organizing the suture and needle in preparation for the next placement.

Throughout, the operator occasionally alternates which hand holds which instrument, optimizing approach angles to the same wound as work migrates along it. Early segments show the driver in the left hand with forceps in the right; other intervals show the driver in the right hand with forceps on the left. This ambidextrous switching maintains a perpendicular needle approach and keeps the assisting hand on the side being penetrated, ensuring reliable eversion and symmetric bites. The spatial relationship remains consistent regardless of hand dominance in the moment: the driver centers over the wound, the assisting instrument opposes across the line, the suture is laid laterally and kept clear, and instruments cross the midline only during loop formation and knot seating.

Tissue handling is uniformly respectful. The forceps lift only the dermal edge to present a bite, then release as tension approximates the edges. Bites are taken at a small, consistent distance from the margin, maintaining alignment without undue depth. The needle arc is controlled so that entry and exit angles are perpendicular, reinforcing eversion and minimizing the risk of inverting the edge. Each knot is tightened incrementally, with the surgeon pausing between throws to check edge alignment and relax excessive tension if needed. When trimming, the tails are cut short but not so close as to risk untying, and the knot stack remains centered over the incision rather than being pulled to one side.

By the end of the sequence, the right-of-center wound is spanned by several neatly spaced simple interrupted stitches. Each knot sits flush over the midline, tails trimmed cleanly, and the edges are uniformly approximated with slight, intentional eversion. The operative field remains tidy: the suture is managed off to the side when not in use, the needle is consistently parked safely in the driver between actions, and the instruments are braced to avoid accidental contact with adjacent unused slits. The final view shows the needle reloaded and lifted above the superior aspect of the same wound, poised for the next placement, with both hands a few centimeters off the surface to keep the field unobstructed. Taken together, the procedure demonstrates a steady, repeatable pattern of simple interrupted closures along a single straight incision—precise perpendicular needle passes, gentle edge handling, secure instrument ties, and meticulous tail trimming—progressing from the center toward the ends until the wound is coapted in an even, well-aligned line. Any momentary differences in apparent wound orientation or labeling reflect perspective changes, not a change in the target; the technique remains consistent on the same line from start to finish, leaving a clean, reliable closure.
