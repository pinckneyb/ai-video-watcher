============================================================
Summary and scope
- Throughout the recording the team concentrates on the vertical incision at the far right margin of the synthetic pad. A few brief early frames show activity that appears to involve the middle or left slits (notably at the very start and once around the middle of the clip), but these are transient and do not represent a sustained change of plan. The remainder of the procedure consistently addresses the single right-hand incision: initial bites at its inferior pole, progressive placement of consecutive bites along the wound, securing with instrument ties at the superior pole, and final trimming of the tails.

Chronological narrative

Beginnings — set up and the first bites (0.0–59.0 s)
- The procedure begins with the operator establishing grasp and exposure. In the very first frames (0.0–14.0 s) there is a brief setup over the central slit, but this is transient; almost immediately attention shifts to the right-hand incision and remains there for the majority of the case. By 15–29 s the team has positioned themselves at the inferior end of the rightmost vertical wound. The left hand consistently controls a needle driver and the right hand holds tissue forceps (Adson/rat-tooth style). The curved needle is grasped roughly at the proximal third from the swage and oriented perpendicular to the skin surface for a controlled, wrist‑driven arc.
- Tissue is presented with gentle, targeted eversion: the right-hand forceps pick up the near (right) wound edge so that the needle can enter a few millimetres from the epidermal margin. The first full-thickness or deep dermal bite at the caudal corner is made with a perpendicular approach; the driver may reorient and re-grasp the needle to complete the arc and pull the suture through. The suture thread follows the needle as it exits the far edge, leaving a tail on the entry side. Following each pass, slack is managed and the instruments briefly reposition to prepare the next bite.

Progression into a continuous line — inferior-to-superior sequence (60.0–180.0 s)
- After the initial passes at the lower corner the work becomes rhythmic and continuous. Multiple frames (30–104 s, 105–119 s, 120–179 s) document a consistent pattern: the left hand (or sometimes the right, depending on slight role switching) delivers the needle across the gap while the opposing hand stabilizes and everts the near wound margin. Needle grasps vary between approximately the proximal third and two-thirds along the shaft; operators routinely regrip the needle as it completes its curve so the tip can be extracted and the suture drawn through cleanly.
- The operator maintains a consistent bite depth and spacing. Bites are placed a few millimetres from the edge and travel through the dermis or dermal–subdermal plane, producing even approximation with slight desired eversion at several passes. Tissue handling is atraumatic: pickups are used only to present tissue and avoid crushing; bites are symmetric. As the line advances the needle driver and forceps work in opposition across the wound: driver on one side, forceps on the other, hands aligned roughly parallel to the incision, moving stepwise from the lower pole toward the midline of the incision.
- During this interval occasional short activities occur around suture management: reloading or parking the needle off the tissue to form an instrument tie, brief cutting of a previous tail, or repositioning of loops to maintain tension and avoid tangles. These are routine maneuvers and do not interrupt the forward progression of the continuous closure.

Mid-procedure consolidation — continuous running technique established (180.0–344.0 s)
- From roughly the middle portion of the video the closure appears established as a continuous running technique. The line already contains sequential bites and the team is extending it up the length of the wound. Frames between 180–254 s and 270–344 s show a consistent workflow: the needle is grasped at the proximal-to-mid shaft, oriented perpendicular to the skin and advanced in a controlled arc from the right edge across to the left edge. The opposing hand maintains eversion and counters motion so each pass exits cleanly.
- Suture management becomes more deliberate: as loops accumulate, the operator occasionally parks the needle near the superior segment, pulls slack in a controlled way, and repositions the standing limb so subsequent passes remain unobstructed. The driver is sometimes momentarily replaced by a second driver (gold-handled in some frames) to facilitate passing or to assist instrument ties; scissors are periodically introduced only to trim tails when knotting or finishing a segment.
- The wound edges approximate neatly as the running line advances; the stitches are closely spaced with even tension along the strand, producing slight but acceptable eversion and close dermal apposition. The working hands remain tightly focused on the right incision and avoid crossing or disturbing the other two parallel slits.

Advancing toward the superior pole and preparing to secure the line (345.0–419.0 s)
- As the closure approaches the upper portion of the rightmost incision the operator begins to transition from pure passage of the needle to securing the running line. Frames in the 345–374 s and 375–404 s window show several passes near the superior third, followed by loop/lock maneuvers consistent with a locking running or a running with securing throws technique. The needle is still grasped in a proximal-third to mid-shaft position and is occasionally parked while loops are organized for a locking throw.
- Hand positions evolve slightly: the needle holder or driver frequently moves to a transverse orientation across the superior wound as the operator forms instrument ties; the opposing forceps intermittently release the bite and instead lift the standing limb or hold tissue while the loop is formed. There is a clear alternation between passing the needle and creating securing loops; this indicates a deliberate intent to lock and secure the running line before final knotting.
- The operator uses the needle driver and forceps in coordinated opposition—driver crossing over the incision to capture loops and form wraps, forceps grasping the standing limb and presenting tissue for the final throws. Tension is applied gently and evenly to avoid excessive inversion or strangulation of tissue.

Final securing, knot tying and tail trimming (420.0–525.0 s)
- The final phase focuses on forming a secure knot, advancing it to the wound edge, and trimming tails. From 420–509 s multiple frames show the left hand forming instrument ties with the needle driver or needle holder while the right hand holds the standing limb and manipulates the tail with forceps. The needle is present at the superior end throughout much of this interval but is not being used to take additional bites; it is controlled while sequential throws are made.
- The knotting strategy is instrument-based: sequential throws are fashioned around the jaws of the driver/holder, the opposite strand is grasped with forceps, and each throw is carefully seated down over the wound. The knot is cinched gradually, ensuring that tension distributes evenly and the wound edges remain well opposed with slight eversion.
- Once the knot is secure the operator introduces scissors to trim the tails. The scissors are positioned perpendicular and tip-to-tip with the needle holder in some frames while the right hand elevates the suture tail for safe cutting. After trimming the superior tail the needle is occasionally retrieved or parked out of the field; the final frames (510–525 s) show the operator applying light tension along the completed line, smoothing the final loop and inspecting the approximation.

Hand position evolution and instrument choreography
- Left-hand dominance for driving the needle is a consistent theme: throughout the case the driver or needle holder is primarily in the left hand, delivering needle passes and forming the securing loops. The right hand serves as the stabilizing partner: forceps grasp the near wound lip to evert and present tissue, control the short tail or standing limb during knot formation, and at times pick up scissors for trimming.
- As the case progresses the instrument roles at the superior pole broaden: the left hand occasionally exchanges between needle drivers and needle holders (including a gold-handled driver noted in some frames) to facilitate both passage and instrument ties. The right hand alternates between forceps for tissue control and needle holders to manipulate the strand during final tying.
- Spatially, the two hands remain in tight opposition across the right-hand incision. Early on, they work low and lateral to the wound; over time they advance cranially (superiorly) along the line. During knotting the needle holder crosses transversely over the incision, and scissors often approach perpendicular to the line to cut tails while the forceps hold the strand slightly elevated.

Technique consistency, adaptation and quality of closure
- The technique used is a continuous running closure with occasional locking or loop/lock maneuvers before the terminal knot—this pattern remains consistent from mid-procedure onward. Bites are uniformly placed within the dermal plane, with attention to symmetric depth and spacing. Eversion of the wound edges is subtle and consistent, indicating purposeful approximation without overt tension.
- The team adapts to the needs of suture management: parking the needle, regripping it to extract the tip, switching to a second driver during complex tying maneuvers, and introducing scissors when trims are needed. These adaptations are procedural refinements, not deviations, and they support a continuous and controlled closure.
- A few frames show transient activity around the other slits (the middle and left incisions) or brief periods where the needle is positioned off the tissue while loops are formed. These do not change the overall approach: the rightmost wound remains the target and the technique is applied there consistently.

Final assessment of the closure
- At the conclusion the rightmost incision is fully approximated along its length with a continuous line of evenly spaced bites. The terminal knot has been formed with instrument ties and advanced down to the wound margin; tails have been trimmed cleanly. The dermal edges are apposed with slight eversion at multiple bites, and tension along the strand appears uniform from inferior to superior.
- No further passes are made after the final knot is secured; the needle is removed from active use and set aside or parked. The other two parallel incisions remain essentially untouched for the duration of the case, apart from the brief early and mid‑procedure frames noted above.
- In short, the procedure proceeds from lower-corner initiation through a controlled running closure up the length of the right-hand incision, concluding with instrument-based knot security and tidy tail trimming. The workflow is characterized by consistent opposing hand mechanics (driver delivering needle, forceps presenting tissue), careful suture management (parking, regripping, loop formation), and an orderly final securing phase that leaves a well-approximated dermal line.

Noted inconsistencies and procedural observations
- Early frames include brief activity on the middle slit and once on the left slit; these appear to be transient repositioning or slack management rather than a change in the plan to close a different wound. I note these departures from an otherwise continuous right‑side focus to account for the frame-to-frame variability, but the uninterrupted majority of frames demonstrates a sustained, methodical closure on the far-right incision.
- Needle grasp location and regripping vary slightly (proximal third vs. two‑thirds, occasional regrips nearer the tip) depending on whether the operator is entering tissue, withdrawing, or pulling the needle through—this reflects normal intraoperative adjustment rather than technique inconsistency.

Overall procedural impression
- The team performs a deliberate, controlled running closure of the rightmost vertical incision. Technique execution is consistent: perpendicular needle approach, intradermal/dermal bites with even spacing, gentle tissue eversion, and final instrument-tying to secure the running line. Instrument choreography—driver in the left hand, forceps in the right, occasional switches for tying and cutting—supports smooth progression. The wound is left well approximated and securely tied with trimmed tails, indicating a complete and competent closure.
