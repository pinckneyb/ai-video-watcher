COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure is performed on a synthetic skin training pad. Work is concentrated exclusively on the right‑most vertical incision located in the upper‑right quadrant of the pad; this single linear wound is the focus for the entire sequence. The operator repeatedly returns to and advances closure along this same wound, moving methodically along its length while maintaining close instrument coordination and consistent tissue handling.

Initial approach and first passes (0–44 s)
At the outset the operator establishes a controlled two‑handed technique. A needle‑holding instrument is brought vertically over the incision while a paired grasping instrument or fingertips oppose from the lateral side. A curved cutting needle with black suture material is secured in the needle driver approximately at the mid‑shaft or slightly proximal toward the hub. The needle is oriented to enter near the wound margin and is driven through the superficial layers with a steep, perpendicular-to-oblique approach. The non‑driving hand elevates and tents the near edge, everting the epidermis slightly and stabilizing the bite point. Early passes show full‑thickness superficial bites of the synthetic dermis taken close to the wound margin to achieve edge approximation without excessive inversion.

From these opening frames the operator pulls the suture through the tissue, managing the free strand with the non‑driving hand and positioning the loop for subsequent throws. The two hands remain within a few centimeters of each other, creating a short working distance that allows precise control of needle arc and suture tension. Work proceeds stitch by stitch: the needle is passed, the suture drawn through, and the free tail controlled in preparation for knot‑tying.

Establishing a series of interrupted bites (45–119 s)
After the initial pass the operator continues along the vertical incision, placing additional interrupted stitches. The pattern becomes consistent: the needle driver presents the curved needle in short controlled arcs, typically grasped near the mid‑shaft to hub to maximize control for the small bite distances required. The assistant hand (or the non‑dominant hand of the operator) uses forceps or fingertips to lift and evert the wound edge immediately adjacent to the point of entry. Bites are shallow to moderate in depth—superficial to full thickness of the synthetic dermis—so that the opposing edges come into close apposition with slight eversion. Tension on placed sutures is actively managed to prevent tissue inversion or gaping.

The operator repeatedly positions the driver from a superior and slightly medial approach with the grasping instrument opposing laterally; sometimes the instrument identities are hard to distinguish in still frames, and the observed handedness varies, but the paired approach remains consistent. Each pass is executed in the same local region as the prior stitches: bites are spaced evenly and placed sequentially to extend the row of interrupted closures from one end of the incision toward the other. After drawing the suture through the wound, the operator often pauses to manipulate the free tail, ready the loop, and perform tying maneuvers.

Progressing toward the superior end and refining technique (120–209 s)
As the session continues, the operator’s focus concentrates more at the superior (cephalad) segment of the wound. Frames in this middle portion show multiple interrupted stitches already in place along the inferior portion, with active work occurring at the most proximal remaining gap. The needle is repeatedly grasped closer to the shaft/hub for stronger control when rotating it through the remaining tissue. The non‑driving hand actively manipulates suture tails and stabilizes edges with fingertip control; in several moments a finger is used directly to approximate the edges while the instrument approaches from above.

Technique refinement is evident in subtle adjustments: bites are taken ever closer to the wound margin to optimize eversion and avoid excessive bulk, and the operator modulates needle approach angle (from perpendicular to a more oblique insertion) to facilitate smooth curvature passage through the synthetic dermis. Slight mattress‑like loop appearances are noted in some prior stitches, suggesting occasional use of deeper or alternative bite configurations to achieve secure apposition where needed, but overall the closure pattern remains interrupted and segmental.

Tension control and knot work (210–269 s)
Midway through the timeline the operator engages in more knot handling and suture tail management. Several frames depict the needle driver used more for traction and knot security than for new needle passage—grasping suture material, rotating to form throws, and holding loops while the assistant hand arranges tails. The non‑driving hand alternates between forceps and bare fingertip control to steady the tissue and manipulate the suture. At times scissors or cutting instruments approach to trim excess tails after final throws.

Throughout this phase the technique remains methodical: after each pass the operator draws the suture snug to approximate the edges with slight eversion, then performs tying sequences. The spacing between previously placed stitches is consistent, and the operator preserves even tension across the closure to maintain planar alignment of the skin edges. The overall impression is of completing a series of interrupted stitches proceeding along the incision, with attention paid to knot security and tail management once the passes are in place.

Returning to place additional bites and sequential completion (270–329 s)
Work proceeds progressively along the incision in a stepwise fashion. The operator returns to the superior-most unclosed gap and places another bite, following the established rhythm: needle drive, suture pull‑through, tail control, and knot formation. In several frames the left and right hands appear to switch roles between driver and forceps depending on approach angle and instrument availability; while this introduces some variability in observed handedness, it does not interrupt the procedural continuity.

Needle orientation remains consistent—curved needle grasped at the mid‑shaft with the tip directed toward the opposing margin. Instrument approach tends to be from above or slightly lateral, while the opposing forceps tend to come in from the lateral or inferior side. Hands remain closely spaced (generally within a few centimeters) to allow coordinated control during needle rotation, tissue eversion, and suture tensioning.

Finishing passes, tightening, and trimming (330–389 s)
As the closure nears completion the operator spends more time securing the last stitches and tidying suture tails. Frames show the wound with a near‑continuous row of interrupted closures along its length; the remaining proximal stitch is tightened and final throws performed with the needle driver holding or rotating the suture while the other hand opposes and reduces slack. Fingertip pressure is used intermittently to hold the wound edges fully apposed and everted while knots are completed.

After securing knots the operator trims tails. Scissors or cutting instruments appear briefly from the top‑right in later frames to trim excess suture close to the knots, leaving short tails. At the very end the row presents as a neatly apposed incision with evenly spaced interrupted knots and short suture remnants. The needle is no longer visible in the final frames, indicating that all desired passes have been completed and the instruments are returning to neutral.

Consistent principles throughout the procedure
Across the entire sequence the operator applies consistent technique principles: use of a needle driver to control a curved needle in mid‑shaft/hub grips for precise rotation; opposed tissue control with forceps or fingertip to evert the epidermal margin; small, evenly spaced interrupted bites taken close to the wound edge to achieve slight eversion and robust approximation; immediate management of suture tension and knot security after each pass; and final trimming of tails to tidy the closure. The working distance between the two hands remains short throughout, maximizing coordination and reducing suture slack that could blemish the approximation.

Noted ambiguities and procedural limitations
Some still images show variability in which hand appears to serve as the needle driver versus the tissue manipulator; instrument identity (needle driver vs. forceps or hemostat) is not always unambiguous in every frame. Despite this, the clinical intent and functional execution remain clear: sequential interrupted closure of the same right‑sided vertical incision. Additionally, a few prior stitches display mattress‑like loop characteristics suggesting occasional deeper or modified bites were used in specific spots to bolster approximation; however, the overarching technique is interrupted skin closure with attention to eversion and even tension.

Final appearance and state
By the end of the recorded sequence the wound is closed along its entire length with a continuous series of interrupted sutures. Edges are closely apposed with slight eversion achieved at each stitch. Knots are seated and suture tails are trimmed short. No active needle passes or fresh bites are visible in the final frames; instead, the operator’s hands and instruments are positioned to finalize tension and trim material, and the needle is absent from view—consistent with completion. The closure is orderly, with uniform spacing and tension control, yielding an apposed incision suitable for inspection or further management.

Overall, the procedure demonstrates a disciplined, stepwise closure: methodical placement of interrupted sutures along one linear wound, careful tissue handling with eversion and edge approximation, progressive knotting and tail management, and final trimming—resulting in a neat, secure superficial closure on the synthetic pad.
