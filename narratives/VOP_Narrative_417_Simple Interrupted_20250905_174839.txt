COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a quiet field: a synthetic suture pad with several linear lacerations. No hands are present at first, then the workflow begins.

0–14 s
The left hand enters from the top/left with a needle driver already loaded—needle positioned near its proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the pad. The right hand arrives from the right with fine forceps, everting and presenting the right wound edge of the inferior‑left incision. With controlled wrist rotation, the left hand advances the needle across the incision toward the right edge the forceps are presenting, completing a pass that builds on an initial bite already through the left edge. The tail is kept inferior‑left to keep the field clear.

15–29 s
Attention turns to managing the strand. The right hand repeatedly draws the free end laterally to the right, clearing slack from the prior passage. The left hand intermittently stabilizes the standing end near the lower‑left corner. The needle driver briefly regrips the needle to confirm control, then releases to allow the suture to pull through smoothly. As the sequence progresses, the driver is reloaded with the needle in a ready position—held at the junction of the distal third and proximal two‑thirds, perpendicular to the skin—preparing for the next bite near the lower‑central slit.

30–44 s
With the bite in place and the needle parked on the right, the focus shifts to knot tying over the lower‑left slit. The driver, positioned to the left of the wound, grips the short tail; the other hand controls the long limb off to the right. An instrument tie is performed: the long strand is wrapped over the driver, the driver captures the short end, and the first throw is advanced and seated. Alternating wrap direction follows to square the knot. Tension is applied symmetrically, sliding each throw down to the epidermal surface without crushing the tissue.

45–59 s
The rhythm of tying continues. The right hand forms loops and manages tension while the needle driver, reintroduced from the upper‑left, acts as the tying instrument, repeatedly grasping and releasing the short tail to complete successive throws. The knot is centered precisely over the laceration, and the long limb with the needle remains parked to the right. As the knot is secured with alternating lays, both hands withdraw, leaving the stitch seated and the ends trailing.

60–74 s
Work shifts to a small central‑left incision. The right hand enters with a gold‑handled needle driver holding the needle roughly two‑thirds from the tip; the left instrument (forceps) stabilizes and mildly everts the left wound edge. The needle is regripped for angle and driven left‑to‑right across the slit. After the pass, the driver releases the needle and the right hand draws the long limb laterally to the right, clearing slack and setting up for tying.

75–89 s
Back to the lower‑left laceration, the left hand now holds the driver while the right hand alternates between pickups for edge control and fingertip traction on the suture. The needle is grasped toward its proximal half, oriented perpendicular, and driven through the near edge with the pickups everting tissue. The driver regrips as needed to advance the needle and manage the loop. The suture is drawn across the wound in a controlled, lateral path to prevent tangling with adjacent stitches.

90–104 s
Tying resumes at the lower‑left incision. The needle lies off to the right, out of the wound. The driver works over the knot stack, grasping the strand near the loop to build throws. The opposite hand sporadically appears with forceps to tension the free end, and a scissors or hemostat briefly passes over the field before exiting. The knot is formed and seated on the surface; no new needle passage occurs. Both hands then clear the field, leaving a clean, centered knot with short and long tails visible.

105–119 s
The left hand holds a needle driver near the lower‑left laceration as a stabilizer while the right hand briefly uses toothed forceps to adjust the tissue/strand, then switches to a gold‑handled driver to regrip the needle at the ideal point (distal third/proximal two‑thirds). The needle is oriented square to the skin, then released to let the right hand pull the free strand laterally. This sequence is about precise needle control and efficient pull‑through without additional trauma.

120–134 s
The scene shifts centrally. A vertical slit near midline already has a suture passed across it. The left hand holds the needle driver as a tying instrument above the field; the right hand manages the suture ends, presenting the short limb. An instrument tie is executed: loop, grasp, slide, and seat—then an opposite‑direction loop to square the knot. Throws descend straight down the horizontal axis of the strand, keeping the knot centered; no forceps manipulate the tissue edges during this portion.

135–149 s
Over the left‑central wound, the dominant hand continues instrument ties to secure the stitch while the opposite hand alternates between fingertip strand control and the brief use of forceps. Once the knot is firm and square, scissors appear in the dominant hand to trim the tails. The non‑dominant hand stabilizes the knot during cutting to prevent loosening. The stitch is completed cleanly with short, even tails; instruments are kept close to the field without disturbing adjacent closures.

150–164 s
A new stitch is placed on the central vertical slit. The right hand, with needle driver, presents the needle perpendicular to the skin and drives through the left edge under the guidance of the left hand’s tissue forceps, which evert and steady the margin. A hemostat or secondary driver is briefly parked on the left to control the left‑side limb. The needle and suture are then drawn through to the right, the long free end managed laterally to maintain order among strands and prior sutures.

165–179 s
Knot tying for this new central stitch begins. The right hand uses the needle driver to grasp the short tag close to the wound; the left hand wraps the long free end around the driver to form the loop. The driver captures and pulls the short limb through. Successive throws are completed with alternating wrap directions to form a square knot. The hands remain elevated above the field, exchanging tension across the horizontal axis to keep the knot centered and the edges approximated without overtightening.

180–194 s
The tying sequence continues and concludes. The left instrument holds the standing part just proximal to the incision, guiding the descent of each throw, while the right hand forms and advances loops, then cinches them down. No new needle passes are made; the focus is on precise, controlled seating of the knot, maintaining eversion and alignment of the wound edges along the interrupted suture line on the left side of the pad.

195–208 s
Final checks and tension adjustments occur briefly: the right hand hovers over the incision to control the free strand while a metal instrument from the upper‑left supervises knot position near the stack. Then, both hands withdraw. The field is left with a neat series of simple interrupted sutures—particularly on the left‑sided incisions—while other training slits remain untouched, marking a clear endpoint to the session.

Overall flow and technique
Across the timeline, the procedure moves in a deliberate cadence: needle passes are performed with the needle oriented perpendicular to the skin and aided by gentle edge eversion with pickups when needed; pull‑throughs are followed by careful slack management; then instrument ties are executed with alternating lays to square each knot. The operator alternates instrument roles fluidly—drivers double as tying tools, forceps appear briefly for tissue control, and scissors arrive only after knots are secure. Suture ends are consistently directed laterally to prevent tangling, the needle is parked safely when not in use, and tension is applied symmetrically to seat knots without blanching. The result is a stepwise closure using simple interrupted stitches, progressing from the inferior‑left and left‑central wounds to a central vertical slit, each stitch placed, tied, and, when appropriate, trimmed before moving on, maintaining a steady, efficient rhythm throughout.
