Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
The sequence shows a controlled, repeatable routine: perpendicular needle entries, smooth arc-following, and consistent instrument ties with knots seated directly over the wound. Hand coordination is competentâ€”the driver acts as a post while the opposite hand manages the tail, and forceps are used purposefully for eversion. The rhythm is generally steady with minimal unnecessary travel away from the field.
