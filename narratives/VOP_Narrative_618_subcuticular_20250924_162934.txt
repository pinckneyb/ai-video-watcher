COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure focuses on the short horizontal incision located at the very top of the pad — the superior-most, short straight slit just below the upper edge. From the first seconds through the end of the recording, all work is confined to that single incision; other slits visible on the pad remain untouched except as visual context. Over the course of the video the operator methodically advances along this short wound, placing successive dermal bites, controlling tissue with fine forceps, reorienting and regripping the curved needle as necessary, and intermittently tying and trimming the suture to secure portions of the line as it is brought to apposition.

Initial approach and first passes
At the outset the left hand holds a needle driver while the right hand holds tissue forceps. The needle is consistently grasped approximately two-thirds from the tip (described in frames throughout the sequence), with the curve oriented to create an efficient arc through the dermis. The driver approaches the incision from the left and the forceps present the right edge for purchase: the instrument geometry is classic — driver on one side, forceps on the opposing side, forming a small, controlled triangle of work directly over the wound. The needle is driven nearly perpendicular to the skin surface, the wrist is rotated to follow the curvature of the needle and the tip is advanced through a dermal/subdermal plane a few millimeters from the wound margin, producing small, even bites and gentle eversion of the edge.

In the earliest frames the operator places an initial stitch at the left end of the superior incision. The forceps tent and evert the left wound margin as the needle holder drives a perpendicular arc into the tissue, the suture is drawn through and tensioned, and a short tail is produced. Immediately after passage the needle is reloaded in the driver, reoriented across the incision and readied to take the contralateral bite; later frames show that knot tying and trimming of a completed stitch at the left end are performed before additional work to the line proceeds. Scissors enter briefly in the left field to trim knot tails, and the operator uses the free suture end controlled by the opposite hand to manage slack during tying. Throughout these early steps instrument spacing is tight and efficient, with hands straddling the wound and the suture strand looped broadly across the superior field to remain out of the working plane.

Progression across the wound and technique setup
Following initial placement and occasional knotting at the left end, attention repeatedly returns to the same superior incision to place successive bites advancing toward the right. The surgeon repeatedly loads the curved needle in the driver at the proximal third to two-thirds mark, aligns the arc perpendicular to the skin, and approaches either the left or right edge depending on the pass. Forceps are used to pick up and evert the chosen wound margin — most commonly the right edge when the driver approaches from the left — to present the dermal tissue for a reliable purchase. The tissue handling is consistently gentle: edges are lifted and everted but not crushed, and bites are placed a few millimeters from the margin to achieve appropriate approximation.

As the procedure continues, a clear pattern emerges. The operator alternates between passing the needle through one side and then the opposite, at times regripping the needle after partial passage to maintain control of the emerging tip. The hand roles are generally consistent: left-hand needle driving and right-hand tissue control in many segments, but intermittently the hands exchange roles or a second needle driver appears briefly to assist with repositioning, knot tying, or to control the suture strand. The suture strand tends to be draped superiorly across the field so it does not obstruct the next bite, and the needle is repeatedly reoriented and reloaded to maintain an efficient arc orientation as the operator moves along the line.

Evidence of intermittent knotting and trimming
Throughout the mid-portion of the recording there are multiple episodes of knot tying and trimming. Early on, a stitch placed at the top-left is tied and a knot trimmed before the operator continues. Later frames indicate repeated localized tying activity near both the left and right ends at different times: the operator forms instrument-tied throws with the driver and forceps, secures suture loops, and uses scissors to trim tails. These tying episodes indicate that portions of the line are being secured as discrete units. In some sequences the operator completes a pass and immediately ties; in others, the needle is reloaded and additional bites follow without immediate knotting. This sequencing reflects a pragmatic approach to securing approximation where required and managing suture length and tension as the line is advanced.

Transition to continuous advancement and final passes
In the latter third of the recording the superior incision appears largely approximated by a continuous line of stitches with the final activity focused at the right terminus. At this stage the needle and free suture are present at the far right end of the wound; the hands converge at that corner with fine forceps stabilizing the right margin and the driver delivering final bites a few millimeters from the edge. The needle continues to be grasped at the proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and driven with a smooth wrist rotation through the dermal layer to the opposing edge. The operator then draws the suture through and tensions it to bring the edges into alignment, maintaining even spacing and symmetric depth of purchase.

During the final passes the surgeon alternates between holding the needle driver and using forceps to receive the needle tip as it exits, permitting prompt regrasping and quick progression. Instrument ties are thrown at the far right to secure the terminal segment, and scissors reappear to trim the tails. Hands remain opposed and closely apposed to the wound throughout these motions, the needle driver generally operating slightly superior and to the left of the incision while forceps or fingertips work immediately opposite to control tissue purchase and to assist knot formation.

Hand position evolution and instrument choreography
Across the entire procedure the basic choreography is steady: one hand presents and stabilizes tissue while the other manipulates the needle to take a perpendicular bite. At the start the left hand predominantly controls the needle driver and the right hand the forceps. Mid-sequence there are brief role exchanges and occasional use of two drivers — one to manage the needle and another to control strand tension or facilitate knot tying — but the general pattern reasserts itself quickly. As the work progresses from left to right along the incision the operator’s body positioning shifts subtly so that the needle driver continually approaches from the left or slightly superior-left and the forceps respond from the right or inferior-right to oppose it. This creates a steady working triangle that moves with the operative front — whenever the site of interest shifts a few millimeters to the right the hands follow, preserving perpendicular approach angles and effective eversion of margins.

Throughout the sequence instrument regrips are frequent and purposeful: the needle is commonly grasped about two-thirds from the tip or at the proximal third depending on the intended arc and whether the surgeon needs more control of the tip or body of the needle. Regrips allow smaller corrective rotations to maintain a smooth, controlled pass and to prevent undue tissue trauma. The suture strand is managed so it lies away from the immediate surgical plane, either draped superiorly or temporarily parked while knots are thrown, preventing entanglement with the instruments.

Technique consistency, adaptations and minor inconsistencies
The technique applied remains focused on achieving reliable dermal apposition with eversion of wound edges. Bites are consistently dermal/subdermal and sited close to the wound margin. The needle orientation is kept near-perpendicular for efficient and predictable passage, and forceps are used to evert tissue and to receive the needle as it exits. The surgeon demonstrates consistent control of depth and bite placement so that the finished margin approximation is even and symmetric.

There are small variations in how the sutures are secured — sometimes a bite is immediately followed by a knot and trimming, in other sequences the operator places an additional pass before securing and trimming. These variations appear to be tactical decisions rather than deviations in core technique. At moments the narrative suggests both interrupted-style tying at localized sites and a running-like progression advancing along the line; these behaviors coexist as the operator toggles between securing already-placed bites and efficiently advancing to the next required purchase. Despite these procedural subtleties the overall objective — stepwise secure closure of the superior incision — remains unchanged and is executed with coherent instrument technique and suture management.

Spatial relationships and working geometry
From start to finish the instruments converge at close range over the incision, forming a controlled and repeatable geometric relationship. The needle driver typically occupies the superior-left quadrant relative to the incision, approaching with a perpendicular trajectory, while forceps or fingers work from the right or slightly inferior aspect to evert and stabilize the opposite margin. During knot tying the two instruments come even closer as loops are thrown and tensioned, and scissors enter from the lateral field to trim tails. The suture strand habitually arcs across the top of the pad, out of the working plane, minimizing interference. When the right end requires final work the working triangle migrates to the superior-right quadrant but retains the same relative orientation: driver superior, forceps inferior/opposite.

Final state
By the end of the recording the superior incision is well approximated along its length. The operator has placed a series of well-formed dermal bites from left to right, intermittently securing sutures with instrument ties and trimming tails as needed. The margins are everted and aligned, with symmetric bite depths and consistent spacing that produce a smooth closed line. Final activity centers on the far right terminus: the needle makes the final passes, a secure knot is fashioned and tails are trimmed. The suture strand and any remaining short tails are managed to lie tidily above the wound, and instruments are withdrawn as the closure reaches a stable, finished state.

Overall, the procedure is a controlled, methodical closure of the superior-most horizontal incision: the surgeon uses standard needle handling (proximal-to-mid needle grasp, perpendicular arc, wrist rotation), deliberate tissue eversion with fine forceps, and attentive suture management (intermittent tying and trimming) to convert an initially open, slightly gaping wound into a neatly approximated closure with even, everted edges and trimmed knot tails at each secured segment. Minor sequencing variations — sometimes securing each bite immediately, at other times advancing and securing in runs — reflect practical intraoperative judgment but do not compromise the consistent attention to perpendicular needle entry, dermal bite depth, and gentle tissue handling that characterize the entire repair.
