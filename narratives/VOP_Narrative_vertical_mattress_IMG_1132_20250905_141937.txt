COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a deliberate setup and a clean first bite. From 0–14 s, the right hand controls a gold‑handled needle driver and the left hand holds fine tissue forceps. Working on the central vertical incision of a skin pad, the operator aligns the needle at the junction of its proximal and middle third, squares it to the skin, and drives an outside‑in bite on the far (right) edge while the left forceps lightly evert the near margin for protection and exposure. The driver follows the needle’s arc and makes small angle corrections without crowding the wound.

From 15–29 s, the rhythm of a simple interrupted stitch takes shape. The needle is released, the suture is drawn through smoothly to avoid dragging across the surface, and the needle is reloaded near the mid‑body. The tip is presented at 90 degrees to the left edge for the contralateral bite, with the curvature aligned to follow a controlled arc. The hands work in opposition—right hand to the operator’s right, left hand to the left—keeping the field open and the suture draped away from the incision. By 30–44 s, the left hand everts the edge precisely as the driver advances through the left margin. After the pass, the driver lets go, the thread traverses the gap, and the left forceps briefly present the needle so the right hand can regrip at a driving position for the next step.

In 45–59 s, the sequence tightens into a consistent cadence: regrip, clear slack, reload, present. The right driver retrieves the needle already out from the prior pass, then, while the left hand briefly releases the forceps to pull slack, the suture is cleared laterally. The needle is reloaded at the proximal‑to‑middle third and brought back to the wound, the tip presented perpendicular, precisely adjacent to the forceps, ready for the next bite. The instruments oppose each other across a short corridor; hands avoid crossing and the suture tails are kept out of the working zone.

With the stitch placed, 60–74 s shows the first knot being seated using an instrument tie. The left hand briefly steadies the near edge with forceps as the right hand uses the needle holder to form and cinch throws. The knot is snugged down with opposing, level tension and then released. The driver then migrates to the right side to reload the needle for subsequent placement while the left hand manages the suture tail and briefly helps orient the needle.

From 75–89 s, the right hand tensions the suture to seat and square a central knot while the left hand controls the free end—no forceps contact tissue in this interval. After the knot is secured, the right hand re‑grasps the needle on its body and orients it tangentially, then perpendicular to the tissue at the next planned entry on a lower left incision area, staging for the next bite. The left maintains slack management, keeping strands separated across the field.

At 90–104 s, the workflow transitions from knot to turnover. The left hand continues to control the suture and needle in a driver while the right hand brings in scissors to trim tails close to the knot. After cutting, the right hand resumes with a needle driver now holding the reloaded needle; the left switches to Adson forceps and approaches the edge, setting up the next pass.

The next stitch cycle runs 105–134 s. The right hand completes extraction through the right edge and regrips near the swage to pull through efficiently, then reloads at the proximal-to-middle third with a perpendicular presentation to the contralateral edge. The left forceps evert the target margin 1–2 mm from the cut, protecting the edge and ensuring symmetric depth. In the early portion of 120–134 s, the left forceps directly assist in removing the needle from the inferior-left margin as the right hand momentarily releases and repositions; slack is drawn through, the needle is set down momentarily on the pad, then reloaded in a driving orientation. A brief, controlled instrument crossover occurs as the driver comes across midline toward the left edge, then the tips realign with the near margin for an accurate entry.

From 135–149 s the operator clears the strand in a wide, safe arc to prevent dragging over the wound, then reloads the needle at the proximal third with the jaws perpendicular to the curve. Small in‑holder rotations fine‑tune alignment so the tip meets the near edge at a mirrored distance from the prior stitch. The forceps maintain a light grip at the dermis, everting without crushing.

With edges approximated at the last stitch, 150–164 s returns to knot work. The needle is “parked” safely on the long strand while the right hand performs an instrument tie over the midline; the left hand controls the short tail and the pad for countertraction. Alternating throws are applied in opposing directions to square the knot. Once seated, the right hand transitions back to the right side to reload the needle, while the left tidies the field and tensions the suture to help untwist the strand.

A complete stitch-and-tie cycle is captured from 165–179 s. The right hand places a new pass with the needle held at the mid‑to‑proximal third, entering perpendicularly. The left forceps stabilize the bite site and later take control of the free end during knotting. An instrument tie is executed in alternating throws at midline; the knot is seated down evenly, and scissors briefly appear to trim the tails close. The right hand ends this sequence with the needle reloaded for the next pass.

From 180–194 s, the right hand drives a smooth arc from the right edge toward the left while the left forceps lift and evert each margin to guide entry and exit. Bite placement is symmetric—roughly 3–5 mm from each edge with consistent depth through dermis. The needle is regrasped on emergence and the suture is drawn through, leaving a clean tail on the entry side ready for tying.

In 195–209 s, the right hand retrieves the needle from its exit site, pulls slack, and reorients perpendicular to the wound for a subsequent bite from right to left. The left forceps hold the near edge left of center to oppose the driver. The suture is kept long across the superior field to preserve visibility; instruments avoid crossing except briefly during reloading.

Next, 210–224 s focuses on the left margin. The left forceps evert the dermal edge as the right hand completes needle extraction from the left side and pulls the strand through. The needle is reloaded with the curve perpendicular to the skin and the tip positioned to enter just lateral to the prior puncture, maintaining spacing. The hands remain opposed—forceps low/inferior at the edge, driver above/superior.

With the pass complete, 225–239 s transitions into tying and reset. The right hand pulls the suture through while the left hand, having set down the forceps, controls the short tail with fingers. The right needle holder performs instrument throws, retrieving the short end and alternating directions to square the knot over the wound. After securing, the right hand reloads the needle mid‑curve and orients to the next incision on the right, while the left manages slack and briefly steadies the near edge as needed.

The sequence culminates in 240–251 s with a two‑instrument tie. The right hand uses the needle holder to form loops on the long strand while the left hand—now with a second holder—presents and passes the short tail. Opposing throws are tightened levelly across the incision to center and seat the knot without twisting or over‑compression. No forceps are used here; eversion is maintained by suture tension. The instruments withdraw together, leaving a neat interrupted suture centered over the wound, and the right hand has the needle ready to continue if additional closures are planned.

Across the entire video, the operator’s technique evolves from careful, deliberate initial alignment to a smooth, efficient cadence: align and evert, perpendicular entry, follow the arc, regrip and clear slack, reload and present, then tie with alternating, squared throws. The hands remain consistently opposed, with minimal crossing and clear triangulation. Forceps contact is light and strategic, protecting the edges and aiding eversion; suture management keeps strands lateral and off the wound. The flow is steady and organized, punctuated by brief pauses for reloading and knot seating, resulting in symmetric, tidy stitches with well‑seated knots and trimmed tails.
