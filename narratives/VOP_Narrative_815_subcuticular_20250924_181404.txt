COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The work begins and remains focused on a single wound: the long, straight vertical slit at the far right of the synthetic pad. The other visible cuts—especially the far-left slit with completed sutures—serve only as background landmarks. At every timestamp, the operator returns to this same rightmost incision to build closure progressively along its length, alternating between setting up the next bite, driving the needle through, drawing the strand across, and then securing the stitch with either instrument or hand ties when the pass is complete.

Early on, the operator positions both hands in stable, opposing roles around the rightmost incision to establish a reliable cadence. The left hand holds the needle driver and does the bulk of the needle work, while the right hand with fine Adson-type tissue forceps tents and everts the right wound edge to present a clean dermal margin. The needle is consistently loaded on the driver at the proximal third to mid-body of the curve, and it is oriented near-perpendicular to the skin surface for controlled entry. In the opening moments, the pass is initiated at the lower half of the slit and then proceeds centrally along the same line. The left hand advances the needle in an arcing wrist motion, respecting the curvature while the right hand steadies the tissue immediately adjacent to the bite point. The needle transits from the right edge to the left, leaving a visible strand spanning the gap, but tying is deferred while the operator continues to refine orientation and depth on subsequent passes.

As the sequence develops, the operator’s technique remains consistent. The needle tip is placed a few millimeters from the epidermal edge, enters at approximately 90 degrees, and follows a smooth, circular path through the dermis before the driver or forceps re-grip the needle to complete the arc. The forceps’ role is deliberate: edges are lifted, everted, and stabilized without crushing, giving a reproducible target and ensuring symmetric bites on the opposing side. The suture management is intentional from the start—the nonworking limb is draped to the side and the loop or tail is kept clear of adjacent cuts—so that when each pass is complete, there is no entanglement and visualization stays crisp.

The operator alternates between setting up and executing passes across different regions of the same slit—sometimes near the top, sometimes at the distal end—but always returns to the same wound. In one early area near the superior end, the bite is taken with the needle driver oriented obliquely across the wound while the right-hand forceps elevate the right lip; the needle is then reloaded to continue the arc across to the far edge. In another stretch toward the distal portion, the lower edge is everted in a similar fashion, and the driver delivers the tip perpendicularly into the dermis. Whether working superiorly or distally, the spatial geometry remains constant: hands oppose each other across the slit, the needle driver crosses the wound line to enter, and the forceps either set up the target margin or move to the opposite side to retrieve the emerging needle and help pull the suture through.

Midway through the procedure, an assistant briefly enters to help manage slack with a second needle holder or hemostat, holding tension on the strand while the primary operator drives and reloads the needle. This short interlude doesn’t change the technique but reinforces the suture control: the assistant keeps the long limb out of the field while the operator finishes a pass across the rightmost slit’s upper segment. At other times, a small retractor or white-handled instrument is used in place of or alongside the forceps to lift the right wound edge. Again, there is no deep dissection—only the superficial layers are manipulated, and the action is limited to presenting the dermis for a clean needle pass and preserving eversion.

As the first complete stitch on this wound is readied for tying, the suture is drawn through smoothly with the long limb trained to one side, and the short limb controlled by the opposite hand. The operator employs instrument ties directly over the rightmost slit, using the needle driver in one hand and forceps or a second instrument in the other, alternating instrument positions as each throw is formed. The knot is cinched down carefully to seat on the skin surface, approximating the two lips without blanching or excessive crush. Scissors appear to trim the tails once the knot is secured. With this secured stitch in place, the operator re-establishes the same working pattern and moves to the next bite along the same slit.

The sequence continues in cycles: prepare the margin by lifting and everting the right lip; orient the needle perpendicular to the skin; enter at a consistent distance from the edge; rotate through the dermis; re-grip and complete the arc across; draw the suture through; then tie and trim when indicated. Between these cycles, there are brief pauses dedicated to needle loading and orientation. In these moments, the driver maintains control of the needle at the proximal third, the right hand may momentarily use the forceps to nudge the needle into a true perpendicular to the wound, and the suture tail is swept away from the operative zone. On occasion, the operator parks the needle safely on the skin surface before tying, particularly when hand ties are used, keeping the curve out of the tying path while maintaining gentle approximation with finger tension alone.

Tying methods alternate as needed. Several stitches are secured with instrument ties, with the needle driver and forceps trading central positions over the wound to form and seat each throw. In another stretch, the operator uses hand ties, with the long limb attached to the needle managed by one hand and the free limb controlled by the other. During hand tying, the needle remains visible on the surface near the right edge, kept safely away from the loops while the two edges are guided together with fingertip tension. Across both tying approaches, the goal is the same: to secure the stitch squarely over the wound, maintaining edge approximation and eversion without over-tensioning.

Throughout, the spatial choreography stays tight and predictable. The needle driver typically approaches from the operator’s left toward the rightmost slit, crossing the incision line during needle entry. The right-hand forceps are positioned just lateral to the intended puncture site when setting up the near edge, then shift across to stabilize the opposite margin as the needle tip emerges. The hands often create a short working triangle with the wound at the center and the suture arcing across the top of the field. When ties are formed, the instruments cross directly above the slit; when cutting, scissors come in briefly, usually from the right, to trim tails flush while preserving knot security. In frames where the driver is in the right hand, the left hand momentarily assists with scissors or pickups, but the incision being handled does not change—this role swap is about instrument availability and tying, not about shifting to a new wound.

As closure progresses, the operator returns to the superior end more than once to place additional stitches, then moves back toward the midline or distal segments of the same slit to fill in gaps. Each new stitch follows the same disciplined setup: the right wound lip is everted and stabilized, the needle is oriented perpendicular, and bites are taken at symmetric distances and consistent depth from the cut edges. The suture is pulled through cleanly, the free limb and long limb are separated laterally, and the stitch is secured with either instrument or hand ties before the tails are trimmed. The left-hand incision with prior sutures remains untouched; the central slit remains a reference point but is never actively manipulated in this sequence.

At one point near the top of the rightmost slit, an entire pass and tie cycle is completed in one continuous sequence: the needle is driven through both edges with the driver and retrieved on the far side, the suture is drawn through, instrument ties are executed over the wound, the knot is seated, and scissors trim the tail, leaving a neat, secure stitch in place. Similar cycles recur later: after preparing a bite at the superior portion, a pass is completed, tension is applied to bring the edges together, an instrument tie is formed, and the ends are cut. This repetition builds a line of well-spaced, secure stitches along the same incision, each placed with the same geometry and tissue handling.

Between complete stitch cycles, there are preparatory segments where the needle is loaded, the white-handled instrument or forceps lift the right edge to create controlled exposure, and the driver adjusts the entry angle until the needle lies perpendicular to the skin surface. The needle is then advanced through the near lip, the emerging tip is captured with forceps on the far side, and the driver re-grips the needle to complete the pass. The strand is drawn through, and the operator pauses either to set up the tying phase or to progress to the reciprocal bite, depending on the specific stage. Even when the operator sets instruments down briefly to reposition the pad or flatten the tissue with the fingertips, attention remains on the same rightmost slit, and the next move continues closure along that line.

As the procedure approaches its later stages, there is a visible rhythm of finalizing stitches in quick succession. One stitch is completed with hand ties directly over the slit while the needle is parked out of the tying path. Another is secured with instrument ties and the tails trimmed. In subsequent frames, a new pass is initiated and the suture is pulled through, but tying is not yet shown. Finally, in the closing moments, the needle is again mounted and oriented over the rightmost incision, with both hands hovering to stabilize the field. No new pass is taken in those last frames—they represent the setup for the next stitch to be placed along the same wound.

Across the entire sequence, technique is consistent. The needle is always grasped at the proximal third to mid-curve, entries are perpendicular, the arc is respected, and the forceps are used to evert rather than crush. Bites are placed at even depths and symmetric distances from the cut edge, producing predictable approximation when tension is applied. When tying, loops are laid methodically and seated down with the edges gently apposed, not strangulated. The instruments cross the wound deliberately and return to neutral positions between steps to maintain a clear view of the margins and to prevent the strand from catching adjacent structures. When scissors are used, the approach is brief and precise, cutting tails to an appropriate length without jeopardizing knot integrity.

By the end of the recorded sequence, the rightmost slit has been progressively closed with multiple, discrete stitches, each formed with the same method of dermal purchase, eversion, and secure knotting. Several stitches have been fully tied and trimmed along this line, leaving the wound partially to substantially approximated with intervals of healthy spacing. The final moments capture a fresh pass recently drawn through near the upper portion without a knot yet applied, and then a brief reset with the needle reoriented and the pad stabilized, poised for the very next stitch. The overall impression is of a methodical, uninterrupted concentration on a single incision: edges prepared, needle passes executed with perpendicular control, and stitches secured in sequence until the line is nearly closed, with the technique ready to continue in exactly the same fashion.
