COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a single vertical skin-pad incision located slightly left of center, and the operator remains faithful to one continuous closure along this line from the first approach through the final stitches. The surrounding parallel slits are used only as landmarks in the background; despite occasional changes in camera framing and operator position that make the wound appear at different locations in the field, all deliberate tissue handling, needle passage, tying, and trimming focus on the same vertical cut. The technique is consistent throughout: perpendicular needle presentation, symmetric dermal bites, gentle edge eversion with fine forceps, and secure instrument ties, repeated methodically to approximate the wound from the mid-portion toward the superior end.

The sequence begins with setup and initiation in the mid portion of the incision. The operator introduces a needle driver and fine forceps from opposing sides so that the tips meet over the center of the wound. The needle is loaded correctly—held at the proximal-to-middle third of the curve (often about two-thirds from the tip), with the driver’s jaws perpendicular to the needle’s arc—so it can enter the skin at a true right angle. The forceps pick up a millimeter or two of the near dermal edge, everting it just enough to expose the target margin without crushing. The driver presents the needle tip square to the surface, then rotates the wrist to advance the arc through the near edge and across the gap. As the tip appears at the far edge, the operator briefly regrips the needle to align the curvature to the exit path and completes the passage. The suture strand is drawn through and managed laterally to keep it clear of the field and other slits on the pad.

From this foundation, the surgeon places additional passes at the midline, maintaining parallelism and symmetry. The hands work in close opposition—driver on the working side, forceps on the opposite edge—careful to keep the driver’s approach perpendicular to minimize obliquity and ensure even bite depth. After each pass, the needle is released and regrasped at a favorable point on the body to guide the tip out of the far margin, a movement made smooth by the controlled rotation of the driver rather than a pushing motion. As stitches are accumulated, the operator transitions to knot security using instrument ties. During these ties, the free (long) end is used to wrap around the needle holder while the other end is held as a post; throws are laid snugly down over the incision, and the knot is seated without blanching or strangulating the edges. This knot work occurs centrally over the same vertical line; throws are applied in alternating directions to lock, and the tails are left at appropriate length or trimmed in later steps.

The work proceeds in a rhythm: reload the needle; oppose hands across the wound; evert the target edge with the forceps; take a perpendicular, symmetric bite through the first lip and then the opposite; regrasp the needle for a clean exit; pull the suture through while keeping the strand lateral; and then either move to the next bite or secure the pass with instrument ties. At times, the right hand holds the driver and the left the forceps; at other moments, the left hand assumes the driver while the right manages forceps or scissors. This occasional change in hand dominance reflects subtle repositioning to maintain the most ergonomic angle for perpendicular entries, especially as the operator advances toward the superior portion of the wound.

As the midline closures accumulate, intermittent frames capture knot setting and trimming. Scissors are introduced to reduce tail length after secure knots are laid. During trimming, the driver parks the needle safely away from the tissue while the opposite hand tensions the free end so the scissors can cut cleanly without risking adjacent stitches. When trimming is complete, the needle is reloaded on the driver at the usual point—about two-thirds from the tip—ready for the next pass. The edges remain well approximated; eversion is modest but consistent, and bite placement appears equidistant from the margins on either side of the incision.

With the central portion approximated, attention shifts incrementally toward the upper half of the same vertical slit. The operator remains close to the wound; instruments straddle the incision with tips only a few millimeters from the bite sites. The free suture is managed laterally so it does not drape over the field. To set each new bite near the upper segment, the forceps lift the near edge by about 1–2 mm to present the dermal margin, and the driver moves in perpendicular to the surface. The needle is driven through the near edge, advanced in a smooth arc, and then regripped to guide the tip into and through the far edge. The opposing forceps cross over to the exit side to receive the needle and complete the pull-through. This alternating forceps position—near edge for entry, far edge for exit—continues to stabilize the wound edges and enforce symmetry.

At several moments, the footage shows preparation without immediate penetration: the needle is reloaded, the angle adjusted off-tissue, and the hands align on either side of the incision, poised to take the next bite. This readying phase underscores the operator’s attention to needle angle and hand spacing. The driver hovers just over the entry point at a true right angle; the forceps position just lateral to the target edge, ready to evert and then to catch the tip upon emergence. As soon as tissue contact resumes, the same disciplined arc carries the needle across the gap.

As the operator advances into the superior third, the pattern continues: place a pass, draw the strand through while controlling tension, and tie when appropriate. Instrument ties are executed with the usual two-instrument choreography, sometimes with the right hand converting from forceps to an auxiliary needle holder to facilitate wrapping and sliding throws. The post is maintained on one side of the wound to prevent twisting; each throw is snugged down to close the gap without strangulation. Where knots are already present, scissors cross the wound midline to trim tails while the other hand holds the tail away from the field, leaving ends aligned neatly with the existing series.

Throughout, the needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid-body and presented perpendicular to the skin, a point the operator reinforces by regripping after each pass to restore the ideal orientation for the next entry. The depth and spacing of the bites are kept even; entry and exit points mirror each other across the incision, reinforcing precise edge-to-edge approximation. The forceps application remains gentle—using the tips to evert rather than crush—so the dermal margins stay viable and edges remain neatly apposed.

There is a brief interlude in the middle of the session where a scene shows a horizontal laceration with a running line being advanced. That moment is inconsistent with the rest of the footage, which is uniformly a series of discrete, instrument-tied passes on a vertical incision. Given the continuous work seen before and after on the same vertical slit—with repeated perpendicular bites, instrument ties, and occasional trimming—the horizontal running sequence likely reflects a transient view of a different training area or a misaligned clip. It does not alter the continuity of the vertical closure being performed and is not integrated into the ongoing repair.

After this brief discrepancy, the work returns squarely to the same vertical wound. A previously tied stitch in the central segment is tightened and its tails trimmed, confirming completion and housekeeping on that portion of the line. Then attention moves back to the upper half, where another simple pass is laid; the suture is drawn through and secured with instrument ties. The driver and forceps remain close and symmetric; the suture is kept off the wound edge to avoid entanglement. Between passes, the operator takes care to reload the needle properly and to maintain a perpendicular trajectory, ensuring repeatable accuracy from bite to bite.

At the superior portion, a new stitch is placed with the same pattern: forceps lift the near edge, the needle enters squarely, traverses the tissue in a controlled arc, and exits the far edge where the forceps are waiting to receive it. The strand is delivered through, tension adjusted to approximate without over-tightening, and then the knot is formed with instrument ties. At times the throw sequence is visible; at other times, the stitch is simply set and the operator prepares for the next pass. Where indicated, the scissors are used to trim tails, leaving a tidy line of knots tracking the vertical axis of the wound.

Near the end of the session, several short sequences show preparatory motions—driver aligned, needle properly mounted, forceps poised over the far edge—followed by deliberate placement of one more pass at the superior third. The technique remains unchanged: perpendicular approach, symmetric bites, controlled wrist-driven rotation, and careful regrasping for exit. Once the suture is drawn through, the strand is tensioned and positioned, then the knot is secured. The tools occasionally cross as the needle is transferred and the throw is seated, but they remain centered over the same wound without drifting to other slits.

Hand positions evolve naturally with the field. Early on, the left hand often holds the driver and the right hand the forceps; later, as the operator optimizes angles for the upper segment, the right hand takes the driver and the left manages tissue or suture. During ties, the non-driving hand may switch to scissors or to a second instrument to facilitate posts and wraps. Despite these shifts, the relationship to the incision is constant: the instruments straddle the line, opposing each other across the gap with only a few millimeters of working distance to preserve precision. The suture is kept lateral and away from the other parallel incisions; the needle is reloaded frequently to keep entries and exits perpendicular and clean.

By the conclusion, the vertical slit shows a contiguous series of well-spaced, symmetric, simple instrument-tied stitches spanning from the mid-portion into the superior third. The edges are neatly approximated with mild eversion, and the knots sit flush without undue tension. Several tails have been trimmed; where trimming is deferred, the ends lie aligned with the wound axis and out of the immediate working zone. No manipulation of adjacent slits contributes to the repair, and no stray suture loops cross into neighboring cuts. The final view demonstrates a consistent, controlled technique carried through from initiation to completion: accurate perpendicular needle handling, meticulous forceps-assisted eversion, orderly progression along the wound with deliberate reloading between passes, and secure instrument ties with tidy tail management. The result is a cleanly approximated vertical closure with evenly spaced stitches that restore the line’s continuity and contour.
