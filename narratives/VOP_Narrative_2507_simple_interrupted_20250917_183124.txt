COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens with quiet setup and orientation before any tissue is touched. The pad is presented with three parallel vertical cuts. At first, the operator’s attention is centered over the middle slit while unpacking and mounting the suture. A gloved hand appears with the suture packet, the curved needle is removed and loaded into the needle driver at about the proximal third to the junction of the mid-body, and the instrument is oriented for a forehand pass with the curve opening toward the operator. Throughout these early moments the hands hover above the superior edge of the pad; a ruler lies at the top but is not used for manipulation. No edges are grasped and no bites are taken—this is purely preparation and needle orientation. The driver is adjusted to present the needle perpendicular to the skin surface, the suture strand is organized to the operator’s right, and visualization along the pad is established.

With the needle properly mounted and the strand controlled, the operator shifts intention decisively to the rightmost vertical incision—the only wound that will be sutured in this sequence. The camera perspective and hand positions change to the right half of the field, and from this point onward all tissue work, bites, knots, and trimming take place along this one right-sided incision. The first approach is to its lower half, where the edges gape slightly. One hand assumes the needle driver directly over the wound, and the other brings in tissue forceps to present the near (right) lip. The needle is grasped about one-third from the swage (roughly two‑thirds from the tip) with the jaws perpendicular to the needle curve. The arc is aligned nearly perpendicular to the pad surface so the tip advances cleanly from right to left across the gap. The forceps gently lift and evert the right edge to define entry 3–5 mm from the margin; the driver translates a controlled wrist rotation to drive the needle through the epidermis and dermis, following the curvature without skiving.

As the tip appears within the wound, the forceps switch to help expose the far (left) edge for exit. The driver re-grips the needle mid-arc to maintain the trajectory and the needle exits the left lip with a smooth pull-through. The suture is drawn across while the right hand provides counter-tension laterally to the right, keeping the strand off the field and preventing snagging. This first pass leaves a neat line across the wound but no knot is tied yet. The operator reloads the needle in the driver, again at the proximal-to-mid third, and steadies the strand on the right side. With the pass complete, attention turns to securing the stitch.

Knot tying begins with the needle parked and the driver used as a post. The standing end is controlled with the driver over the wound, and the free end is wrapped with the opposite hand to form instrument ties. Successive throws are created and seated carefully, alternating directions to square the knot. The forceps briefly approximate the edges and control slack as the knot slides down, maintaining eversion and alignment without crushing the dermis. Once seated, the tails are cut with scissors introduced from the side, tips perpendicular to the incision. The first stitch is now finalized at the lower portion of the right incision; tails are trimmed to a consistent length and the field remains tidy.

Building on this start, the operator proceeds proximally along the same right-side line. In the inferior half just above the first knot, another pass is planned. The needle is once again loaded near its proximal third with the curve perpendicular to the skin, and the right hand uses forceps to lift the edge adjacent to the intended entry. The needle enters the right lip and arcs through the dermis in a controlled sweep. Mid-arc, the driver re-grips to maintain a perpendicular orientation to the tissue and deliver the tip to the far side. The forceps are used alternately to help guide the exit, and the suture is pulled through with the free strand intentionally kept to the right to preserve exposure.

Without changing incisions or moving to other cuts, the operator immediately secures this pass with instrument ties. The needle is kept out of the wound while the driver posts against the standing end. Loops are laid with the non-dominant hand, the tail is grasped and advanced, and tension is applied in alternating vectors to confidently seat the knot on the wound surface. The edges coapt with mild eversion; there is no blanching or crushing. After sufficient throws, scissors are brought in to trim the tails close and parallel to the line. The right vertical incision now shows a small row of stitches in its lower segment, and the suture line advances in a stepwise fashion.

Progress continues up the same incision. At the next interspace, the needle is oriented from superior-left toward the right side as needed by hand position, then realigned to a perpendicular entry, and a new bite is initiated on the right lip. The right hand’s forceps stabilize without deep pinching, holding a point near the epidermal edge to prevent tearing. The needle arcs across the gap, exits the opposite side, and is drawn through; the strand remains neatly organized to the right of the pad. The operator pauses momentarily at times to reload the needle between partial arcs, demonstrating careful control and adherence to the needle’s natural curve. As before, the suture is secured with a series of instrument ties performed with the needle parked and the driver functioning as a post. The throws are cinched down sequentially, maintaining edge eversion and ensuring the knot lies centered over the incision. Tails are trimmed when appropriate.

At intervals the team briefly manipulates the suture without placing new bites—tensioning, straightening the strand, or repositioning the needle in the driver. On one occasion, rather than forceps, the free end is controlled by the right hand’s fingers to maintain tension while the left reorients the needle for the next pass. These pauses occur directly over the same right incision, usually at the superior edge of the last tied knot, and serve to prevent tangling and preserve an orderly field.

As the closure progresses into the mid-portion of the right incision, the pattern remains steady and consistent. The left hand predominantly carries the needle driver and approaches from the pad’s superior or medial side; the right hand, with Adson-type forceps, opposes across the wound to present whichever edge is about to be pierced. Entries are generally perpendicular to the skin surface, a few millimeters from each margin, followed by smooth arcs through the dermis. The driver frequently re-grasps the needle mid-course to keep the needle curve aligned to the tissue plane, and the exit is controlled with the assistance of the forceps. Throughout, the suture is drawn through fully and then secured with instrument ties, the needle deliberately parked during knotting to avoid accidental sticks or tissue injury. Once knots are seated, scissors trim the tails flush, and the process repeats a short distance superior to the previous stitch.

The operator’s spacing is methodical, with short, closely spaced bites that maintain consistent width and depth. Each knot is centered over the line rather than to one side, and the edges demonstrate gentle eversion—neither inverted nor overly everted. When the surgeon reaches a point where three adjacent stitches hold the mid-lower wound closed, the work continues toward the upper segment, always on the same incision. There are segments where no penetration occurs; these show the driver adjusting the needle, the strand being laid off to the right, and the hands remaining parallel to the wound to keep the working window clear and avoid crossing unnecessarily. When instrument ties are thrown, hands momentarily cross over the incision, forming a controlled triangle among driver, forceps, and the knot site, then return to their parallel stance.

Near the upper half of the incision, a new stitch is initiated by grasping and everting the superior-right wound edge and driving the needle in a perpendicular arc. The sequence displays entry on the right lip, re-grasp to complete the arc, and exit near the left lip, followed by a full pull-through. Tension is applied to seat the suture before tying. The subsequent instrument ties are applied with the driver posting against the standing end, the other hand wrapping and grasping the tail, and successive throws snugged down carefully. The forceps are used sparingly at this point—just enough to keep the edges aligned during the tie. The tails are then trimmed and the line looks neat, with a clear stepped progression from the inferior portion upward.

Occasionally the operator pauses to reload without taking a bite, parking the needle safely and reorienting the curvature to ensure it will approach the next entry perpendicularly. In one stretch near the top, the curved needle is mounted around the middle-to-distal third and held ready to approach, but no tissue is penetrated; this is simply precise staging for the next pass. At another point, the free strand is tensioned to the right while the needle driver hovers just medial to the wound edge, arranged for entry into the superior bite; this care keeps the strand out of the wound and preserves a clean approach path.

As the row grows, there are brief interludes dedicated to finishing work—tightening the most recent knot a final time, then cutting the tails flush. In one such sequence, the left hand switches from the driver to straight scissors to trim while the right hand’s forceps hold the knot stack steady; the scissors come in parallel to the skin, tips directed toward the knot, and exit once the tails are even. The driver is then re-acquired, the needle reloaded, and attention returns to the gap just above the last stitch.

At the superior end of the right incision, the pattern repeats: the forceps lift the right margin to present the entry point; the needle, grasped at the proximal third, penetrates perpendicularly; the arc is maintained with a mid-curve re-grasp to bring the tip across to the far side; the suture is drawn through, often with the needle lifted away from the field as the free strand is managed to the right; and finally the stitch is tied and trimmed. At one point, the operator uses forceps near the knot more to control suture and alignment than to manipulate the edges, since the edges are already well approximated by the preceding stitches.

When the topmost bite is pulled through and the knot is seated, the driver and forceps remain immediately adjacent to the superior end of the incision for trimming. The left hand maintains control over the needle and suture while the right brings in scissors to nip the tails at an even length. The knot sits neatly on the surface, centered over the line. Immediately after, there is a short pause to reload the needle and lay the suture neatly to the side, preparing for what might be an additional superior bite. In that preparatory moment, no penetration occurs; the needle is simply oriented with care, perpendicular to the wound line, with the suture trailing to the operator’s right.

Before any further passes are made, the team briefly introduces a small ruler above the wound and slides it along the superior end. Hands remain several centimeters above the tissue; no tension is applied to the sutures and no edges are touched. This appears to be a spacing or measurement check—an educational pause to assess the alignment and distance between stitches. During this measurement, the row of completed interrupted stitches is visible along the mid-to-lower segment, and a small residual gap remains superiorly, suggesting the closure is nearly complete and poised for one last stitch if desired. The instruments then withdraw, leaving the field with the right incision displaying a neat series of tied knots, each tail trimmed, and the suture material organized laterally.

Through the entire procedure, hand positions evolve predictably around the single right-sided wound. Early on, the operator transitions from general setup over the midline to a focused stance at the right incision. The left hand most often carries the needle driver and approaches from a superior or medial position, hovering just above the wound and aligning the needle perpendicular to the skin for each entry. The right hand assumes the role of tissue control and suture management: forceps gently evert the near edge at entry and then assist at exit, and when tying, the right hand often manages the free end, wraps the driver to form loops, and uses scissors to trim tails. During needle passes, instruments oppose each other across the incision; during knot tying, they cross succinctly and then return to parallel, keeping the workspace compact and the line visible. The suture strand is consistently kept to the right side of the field to reduce clutter and avoid entanglement.

Technique remains consistent from the first pass through the final tie. Each stitch is executed as a simple interrupted: perpendicular skin entry on one side, controlled arc through the dermis, meticulous re-grasp to preserve the curve’s geometry, exit on the opposite side, full pull-through of the strand, then secure tying with a series of instrument throws. The needle is routinely parked during knotting to reduce risk and improve control, and the driver acts as a reliable post. Forceps are used with finesse—enough to evert and present tissue without crushing. Bite size and depth remain harmonious from stitch to stitch, contributing to even approximation and a cosmetically favorable alignment. When finishing each stitch, tails are cut close with scissors introduced parallel to the skin to avoid inadvertently shearing the knot.

By the end of the sequence, the rightmost vertical incision has been transformed from a gaping linear cut into a nearly closed line with a short row of well-spaced, closely approximated interrupted stitches running from its inferior portion toward its superior end. The knots are stacked neatly on the surface, tails trimmed, and the edges are coapted with slight, deliberate eversion. After tying and trimming what appears to be the most recently placed superior stitch, the operator reloads the needle and organizes the strand, then pauses to slide a ruler along the top segment—an indication of attention to spacing and precision. The closure at that moment shows strong progress with only a small residual superior gap visible; it is positioned for a final stitch should the procedure continue. No other incisions are manipulated at any point beyond early non-contact setup, and no alternate suture lines are started. The workflow, instrument choreography, and suture management all center on this single right-side incision from the first tissue engagement to the final measured appraisal, demonstrating a disciplined, repeatable interrupted technique carried methodically up the wound.
