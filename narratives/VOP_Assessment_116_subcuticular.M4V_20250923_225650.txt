COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a focused, methodical closure of the vertical incision located on the pad’s right side. From the outset the operator establishes a consistent working rhythm: one hand manipulates the needle with a needle driver while the other provides tissue control, suture management, and eventual knot tying. Over the course of the recording the right-sided incision is addressed in a stepwise fashion from inferior toward superior (with periodic repositioning and tying at its ends), and the team repeatedly loads, advances, and withdraws the curved needle, secures interrupted stitches, and trims tails—progressing the closure until the line is fully approximated and knots are trimmed.

Initial approach and early passes
The operator approaches the wound with a classic two‑instrument technique. The needle driver is routinely grasped with the right hand and a second instrument—most commonly toothed forceps or a second driver—works from the opposite side. The needle is habitually held about the proximal-to-mid or distal third of its curve (varying slightly while the operator re‑grips), with its curve oriented approximately perpendicular to the skin surface as it is introduced. Early passes show the driver advancing the needle tip through the near edge and executing a smooth arc to exit the far edge; forceps lift and evert the opposing lip to present dermis and receive the needle tip. Bites are taken a few millimeters from the wound margin, consistently symmetric in depth across the two edges, with modest eversion to promote edge apposition. Once a bite is completed the suture is drawn through and limb lengths are adjusted in preparation for knot security.

Progression along the incision, stitch by stitch
Work continues in a linear progression along the right incision. After initial bites, the operator reloads the needle as needed and advances to adjacent sites along the wound. The pattern is interruptive rather than continuous: individual passes are placed, the suture drawn through, and the operator prepares and secures knots (hand‑tying) at appropriate intervals. Hands typically straddle the incision with the needle driver on the operator’s right side and the opposing instrument on the left, enabling a tip‑to‑tip, bimanual control over each bite. When forming and tightening knots, the left instrument commonly controls the standing end, forming loops with one hand and cinching throws with the other. Tail trimming follows knot security, with scissors introduced deliberately to cut close to the knot without catching adjacent tissue.

Needle handling and regrips
Throughout the closure the operator demonstrates controlled needle management. The needle is frequently grasped at different points along its shaft—sometimes the distal third, other times the midshaft or proximal third—depending on the pass being made and on subsequent reloading. The driver rotates the wrist to follow the needle’s curvature through tissue, maintaining an arcing motion that exits the opposite edge cleanly. At times the assistant hand (or second driver) repositions the needle tip to facilitate retrieval or to transfer the needle back into the driver for the next arc. When the needle is withdrawn after a bite, it is reorganized, reloaded and positioned for the subsequent interrupted pass.

Tissue handling and bite quality
There is consistent attention to tissue eversion and symmetric bite depth. Forceps repeatedly lift and evert the dermal margins to expose the dermis for a full‑thickness—or near full‑thickness—purchase appropriate for skin closure on a pad. The tissue is not subjected to excessive crush; instead, light, precise traction is used to prevent tearing and to guide the needle exit. The operator aims for even spacing between stitches and consistent bite distances from the wound edge so that successive interrupted knots will yield uniform approximation when tightened. When drawing the suture through, the operator maintains the loop and tail superior to the wound line to avoid entanglement and to preserve visualization.

Hand position evolution and roles
At the start the typical configuration is the right hand on the needle driver and the left hand holding forceps. As the case progresses the roles remain largely stable: the right hand consistently drives and manipulates the needle while the left hand provides countertraction, receives the needle, and handles suture tails during knot formation. When tying, the hands come together midline over the wound—often crossing slightly—to form square throws and to seat knots cleanly. During trimming, scissors approach from the left side, with the stabilizing instrument holding the knot and the right hand withdrawing the needle or repositioning for the next stitch. Periodically both hands move away briefly to reload the needle and rearrange suture limbs before returning to the wound; such repositioning is deliberate and brief, designed to maintain efficiency in the interrupted sequence.

Knot-tying and finishing maneuvers
After placing each pass the operator draws the suture through, adjusts limb lengths, and forms square throws by transferring controlled loops between hands. The left instrument frequently manages the standing limb while the right hand advances the other limb to complete the throw. Knots are tightened gently to approximate edges without strangulation; tails are trimmed with scissors cut close to the knot to present a tidy closure. Toward the superior end of the incision the operator performs definitive hand ties to secure the line topologically and to finish the closure sequence. Once secured, the needle is parked or set aside on the drape and the final trimmed knot presents a clean, approximated edge.

Spatial relationship to surrounding anatomy and other incisions
Throughout care, the operator confines activity to the right incision; previously placed stitches on other lines remain undisturbed. Instruments are kept close to the wound margins, working within a few millimeters of the closure so that visualization and control are maximal. When forming knots or trimming, the hands may cross briefly over the wound axis, but instrument tips remain parallel to the incision on most passes to avoid obscuring the field. The other vertical incisions on the pad—center or left—are present in the field but are not manipulated in this right‑sided sequence, aside from transient proximity when instruments are reloaded or repositioned.

Adaptations and brief deviations
Occasionally the sequence shows short adaptations: in some frames the left hand may take the needle driver role to reload or reposition the needle, or the operator alternates between needle drivers and pickups for grasping. There is at least one point in the procedure where an existing continuous or running line is referenced; this differs from the dominant interrupted technique being performed, and may reflect earlier practice or a preplaced row of stitches on the pad. When such inconsistencies appear, the operator maintains focus on the right incision and continues interrupted passes, knot security, and trimming on that line.

Completion and final state
As the session moves toward completion the operator advances the closure proximally, placing successive interrupted stitches and securing each with reliable square throws. The final frames show the superior end of the right incision closed with multiple secured interrupted knots, tails trimmed close to the knots, and the wound margins neatly approximated with modest eversion. The needle has been withdrawn from the active field and rests off to the side on the drape in some frames; instruments are laid aside once the final knot is secured and tails are clipped. The sutured line presents even spacing, consistent bite depth, and well-seated knots—an orderly, finished closure with minimal tissue trauma evident on the practice pad.

Summary assessment
Over the entire recording the operator pursued a consistent, instrument‑based interrupted skin closure of the right‑side vertical incision. Needle handling demonstrates appropriate arcs, regrips, and orientation to maintain perpendicular entry and symmetric exits. Tissue handling emphasizes gentle eversion and controlled traction to preserve tissue integrity and to promote edge apposition. Hand positions evolve naturally to support needle driving, needle capture, suture management, knot formation, and tail trimming; the right hand principally controls the needle while the left hand opposes and manages suture tension. Although some frames reference other incision lines or hint at different closure styles earlier on the pad, the dominant, continuous sequence of work is the stepwise interrupted closure of the right vertical incision, culminating in a fully approximated, knotted, and trimmed repair.
