COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a vertical midline incision in the synthetic practice pad, located slightly to the right of the pad’s geometric center. From the first frames the superior portion of this long linear incision is already partially closed with several interrupted stitches; work is focused on completing the remaining open segment of that same central incision. The operator wears gloves and uses a standard curved suture needle with an attached strand of monofilament suture, a needle driver for needle control, and fine toothed forceps (Adson-style or pickup) to manipulate tissue and the suture tails.

Early sequence (0–60 s)
The procedure begins with the needle driver approaching from the superior/left quadrant while the opposing forceps approach from the inferior/right quadrant. The needle is routinely grasped near the mid‑shaft (not exclusively at the tip or swage), and oriented so its curvature can be driven through the skin simulator in a controlled arc perpendicular-to-oblique to the wound edge. The assistant hand (forceps) steadies and everts the near edge, providing countertraction while the driver rotates the needle through the opposing edge to capture both epidermal and dermal analog layers. As each bite is delivered the suture material is drawn through and managed by the forceps or fingers; after needle removal the operator forms the knot, tensions it to approximate slightly everted edges, and trims the excess tails with scissors in some frames. Throughout this early stage the working geometry is classic pincer-style: the needle driver above and medial, the forceps lateral and inferior, tips meeting within 1–4 cm of each other across the incision.

Progressing down the wound (60–180 s)
The operator places a series of successive interrupted stitches moving from the inferior portion toward the mid-portion of the incision. Hand positions remain consistent in principle but show subtle variation depending on the specific bite: at moments both hands straddle the wound from opposite sides (driver from above/left, forceps from below/right); at others both instruments come in from the same side, crowded tightly over the incision. Needle grips remain mid‑shaft in the driver with controlled rotation to advance the needle; the forceps repeatedly lift small segments of the synthetic skin to evert and align the margins prior to passage. Bites are short and superficial-to-mid dermal in the simulator material; each pass is followed by suture drawing and knot formation. The materiality of the pad limits assessment of true tissue depth, a recurring limitation noted as the sequence continues.

Mid-procedure consolidation and knot work (180–300 s)
By this phase much of the central line has been approximated but gaps remain in the mid-to-lower segment. The operator alternates between placing fresh interrupted bites and tending existing knots: tightening, dressing, and trimming as required. The needle driver sometimes approaches from the right/top while the forceps hold tails on the left/bottom — instrument crossing and hand swapping are frequent. The needle is occasionally regrasped and repositioned in the driver as the operator adjusts trajectory for precise purchase at the wound edge. The opposing hand also sometimes uses fingertips alone to manipulate and align the edges when fine control is needed for knot tying. Throughout these frames the pattern is sequential placement of individual interrupted stitches, each being tensioned to produce slight eversion and close epidermal apposition.

Transition to the lateral margin and localized variation (300–420 s)
As the procedure continues the operator is observed placing additional interrupted sutures not only in the midline center but also focusing attention on the right lateral margin adjacent to the central row of stitches. The hand geometry shifts: both hands frequently occupy the right side of the incision, with the needle driver hovering over the incision and the other instrument stabilizing tissue lateral to the stitch column. Needle passes remain short and controlled; the instrument tips are close — often only a few millimeters to a couple centimeters apart — enabling precise coordination during needle transfer and suture drawing. On some frames the operator withdraws instruments to adjust suture tails, gathers loops, and prepares for more secure knot formation; in a few sequences scissors are brought in to trim tails after cutting knots.

Intermittent static and organizing moments (420–480 s)
There are moments when needle passes pause and the surgeon focuses on organizing suture strands and preparing instrument positioning. The pair work in close proximity, exchanging roles between driving the needle and holding the suture, and occasionally relying on a second instrument (long clamp or hemostat) as an anchor for suture tails. This period shows a mixture of finishing individual interrupted stitches and preparing for the next bites; instrument tips frequently cross over the incision in a coordinated fashion to receive and present the needle.

Right‑side continuous segment and localized running pattern (465–569 s)
Interspersed with the majority interrupted technique are sequences along the right margin of the central incision where the suture is advanced in a more continuous fashion along the lateral edge. In several frames the needle driver consistently takes sequential bites along the right aspect, while the contralateral hand maintains suture tension with gloved fingers or a hemostat. These passes progress cranially along that lateral margin and create a short contiguous line of bites in rapid succession. This localized change produces a distinct visual pattern: rather than completing and tying each individual interrupted stitch to closure before moving on, the operator sometimes takes successive bites with interrupted-style passes but with the suture left untied between throws to expedite progress along the lateral column. Even when that occurs, the driver still grips the curved needle mid‑shaft and the forceps approximate the edge for each bite; the net effect is a hybrid of sequential interrupted passes with brief periods where the suture is advanced continuously along one side prior to final knotting. These variations are executed while the main central column of interrupted stitches remains the principal closure strategy.

Late closure, tensioning, and suture management (570–585 s)
Toward the end of the footage, the operator finalizes the remaining stitches along the vertical incision. Hands congregate at the superior and mid‑portions of the wound to secure the final knots and adjust tension across adjacent stitches so the wound coapts uniformly. The needle and needle driver at times rest on the pad when no active passes are underway, and clamps and spare instruments are laid at the edges until needed. In the final active frames the surgeon trims tails and smooths loops so that the lines of knots lie close to the skin surface and the wound edges are brought into consistent apposition with slight eversion at each bite — a typical cosmetic goal for interrupted closure.

Final observation and static field (585–590 s)
The last frames show instruments resting adjacent to the pad and no hands in the field. The needle and needle driver are placed to the side and the incision demonstrates a completed column of stitches along the previously open length. The wound edges are approximated throughout the former defect, suture knots are seated along the column, and a few trimmed tails remain visible. There is no evidence of further needle passes during these final seconds.

Technique development and consistency
From start to finish, the operator uses a conventional needle‑driver grip on a curved needle (predominantly mid‑shaft grasp), and a fine toothed forceps to evert and approximate the tissue analog. The primary method is placement of individual interrupted stitches in sequence along a single longitudinal incision: each bite is planned to capture opposing epidermal/dermal edges, the needle is rotated through a controlled arc, and each suture is tensioned and knotted to maintain coaptation. Over time the operator’s proficiency in coordinating the driver and forceps is consistent — grip points remain stable, bites are kept short and regular, and knot‑forming technique is repeated with steady hand positioning and coordinated instrument exchange.

There are, however, episodic changes in approach. On several occasions a contiguous line of successive bites is taken along the right margin in a more rapid fashion that visually resembles a running progression, with the left hand maintaining suture tension while the driver advances the needle cranially. These intermittent sequences do not replace the dominant interrupted pattern but represent a localized workflow variation to expedite closure on that lateral column before returning to tie and secure individual throws. Throughout, regrasping of the needle and small adjustments in orientation are frequent and pragmatic, reflecting the need to maintain optimal needle trajectory when the operator navigates around previously placed knots and remaining free tissue.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Hand positions evolve from an initial contralateral pincer configuration (driver superior/left, forceps inferior/right) to occasional same‑side approaches as tissue geometry and existing stitches dictate. The hands move along the incision length as the procedure progresses: early work clusters in the inferior segment and progressively moves cranially into the mid and superior segments. When focusing on lateral bites the operator concentrates both hands on the right side of the incision, often with the needle driver directly over the wound and the other hand immediately lateral for tension and tail management. Instrument tips consistently operate within a small working envelope (roughly 1–4 cm separation) to allow precise needle transfer and suture control. When manipulating suture tails for knot formation the operator alternates between using forceps and fingers depending on the maneuver; clamps or hemostats are sometimes used as temporary anchors.

Tissue interaction and bite characteristics
Across the sequence bites are predominantly short and superficial-to-mid dermal in simulated tissue depth. The forceps are used to evert the wound margins before each pass, and slight eversion is maintained after knot tying to promote epidermal edge apposition. The synthetic pad limits definitive assessment of true tissue layer purchase, and this limitation is evident when judging depth and bite security; nonetheless, within the simulator environment the operator consistently captures adequate simulator thickness to bring edges into close approximation.

Final state of the repair
At the conclusion of the recording the entire length of the previously open midline incision appears closed: a continuous series of secured knots line the former defect, suture tails have been managed and trimmed in many areas, and the wound edges demonstrate close apposition with modest eversion. Instruments and clamps are retracted to the pad margins and the field is left organized. The closure exhibits a coherent line of interrupted stitches, with localized shorter segments that were performed as successive bites along the lateral edge prior to knotting but ultimately integrated into the completed closure. The synthetic model displays no obvious gaps, no gross inversion, and—given the limitations of the simulator—an evenly approximated skin edge from superior to inferior.

Overall, the operator demonstrates a methodical, repeatable interrupted‑stitch approach across the entire vertical incision, with consistent needle handling, coordinated two‑handed work to evert and control tissue, and organized knotting and suture tail management. Small procedural variations—brief continuous advancement along a lateral margin, instrument swaps, and regrasping of the needle—reflect pragmatic intraoperative decisions rather than a substantive departure from the principal interrupted closure technique. The final product is a uniformly approximated linear closure with secured knots and trimmed tails, ready for dressing within the constraints of the training scenario.
