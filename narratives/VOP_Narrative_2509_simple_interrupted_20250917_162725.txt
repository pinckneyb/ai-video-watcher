COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens with a quiet survey of the field while the operator stages instruments and orients to the pad. Three clean, parallel vertical slits are visible—left, center, and right—with a ruler across the superior edge providing a stable reference. For the first moments there is no tissue contact. The curved needle and suture are laid out near the ruler, occasionally repositioned by a gloved hand hovering at the top-right, but the skin edges remain completely untouched. The central slit is centered in the frame early, but this appears to be part of the setup and field check; no attempt is made to grasp or evert that wound, and nothing is driven through tissue. Over the next moments, the camera still finds no operative motion, and no hands are in view. The pad sits static with all three slits gaping evenly; no instrument triangulation is present yet, and the needle remains staged at the superior edge. The operative line only becomes clear when the first true engagement occurs.

The work begins in the inferior segment of the rightmost vertical incision, the small slit closest to the pad’s right edge. The left hand brings a needle driver into position above the lower end of this slit, and the right hand meets it with tissue forceps on the lateral (right) wound edge. The right edge is lifted gently to present the dermis. The needle is held around its proximal-to-mid third, oriented perpendicular to the skin so the driver can follow the needle’s curvature. With forceps maintaining a light, everted grip just back from the cut edge, the first bite is initiated at the inferior end. The needle enters the right margin and progresses in a controlled wrist-driven arc toward the slit. At this stage the suture strand trails out of the field superiorly, kept clear of the wound. As the tip penetrates, the driver repositions closer to the tip to maintain a clean arc. The needle continues until the point arcs into the wound. The right-hand forceps briefly switch from tissue to the needle tip to help extract and regrasp as needed. The strand is then drawn through, setting the stage to cross to the far edge.

With the initial pass completed, attention turns to securing the stitch. The curved needle, now out of tissue, is set aside while the driver is used to perform instrument ties. The operator manages the short and long ends to keep them tensioned properly along the right edge. Through these throws, there is minimal contact with the skin edges; the movement is about the suture rather than the tissue. The knot is seated laterally, just to the patient’s right of the slit, and the edges approximate with visible improvement at the inferior end. Moments later, a similar sequence repeats on the next bite up the line. The left hand again takes the driver while the right hand manages forceps. The needle is reloaded one-third from the swage, oriented at right angles to the skin, and the right margin is lifted to achieve consistent eversion and setback from the edge. The needle traverses the wound in a smooth arc, exits symmetrically on the far side, and the suture is pulled through with careful slack management.

Once that bite is in, the driver’s role shifts to tensioning and then cutting. The right hand takes scissors to trim the tails after the knot is tightened and seated flush on the epidermal surface. Cuts are made close to the knot, perpendicular to the trailing strand, leaving neat, short ends lateral to the wound. Throughout, the slit in the center of the pad is left untouched, and all effort remains concentrated on the rightmost slit.

As the work proceeds superiorly along the same wound, hand dominance and approach angle change to accommodate visibility and ergonomics. In one sequence, the right hand brings in the needle holder from the upper-right, hovering above the right-side incision to refine needle orientation. The left hand is out of frame, allowing the operator to reset grip and angle before the next pass. Soon after, control returns to the left hand with the driver while the right hand uses forceps to present the lateral edge, then to seize the needle tip on exit from the far margin. The needle is typically held either at the proximal third or two-thirds from the tip depending on the angle required; this consistency in loading preserves perpendicular entry and ensures the driver can follow the needle’s curvature without torqueing the skin.

The next several passes follow a disciplined pattern: the near (right) edge is gently grasped with toothed forceps just back from the cut edge to avoid crushing; eversion is created to present dermis; the needle is driven in with a perpendicular approach; partial passage prompts the driver to regrasp closer to the point; and the far edge is either stabilized with forceps for the exit or the tip is seized to complete the arc. The suture is drawn through with the loose end managed laterally so as not to kink or drag across the wound. When a stitch is secured, the knot is formed using instrument ties, seated laterally with mindful tension to avoid blanching, and the tails are trimmed. The operator alternates between placing bites and completing knots, steadily moving up the right-hand slit with even spacing and consistent bite depth and setback.

Between placements, there are small interludes dedicated to tensioning an already placed stitch, tightening a knot, or trimming tails. In one passage, the right hand holds the needle driver midline to pull the strand through an already placed stitch, followed by scissor use to clip the excess tail. In another, the left hand stabilizes tissue with forceps while the right hand controls the standing strand and ties additional throws to secure the knot. These interludes maintain the developing row’s uniformity and keep the working field tidy for subsequent passes.

As the closure progresses into the mid-portion of the rightmost slit, completed knots accumulate inferiorly and the working zone shifts superiorly along the same line. The instruments consistently triangulate around the incision: the driver slightly superior or medial, and the forceps lateral and just adjacent to entry or exit points. The driver follows the needle’s arc with wrist rotation; the forceps coordinate eversion, pick up the needle tip when necessary, and otherwise maintain tissue control. On some passes the operator is careful to move the driver from a more lateral to a central position mid-pass to preserve a right-angle trajectory across the slit, reducing the risk of oblique bites. Once through, the suture is drawn until the loop sits comfortably across the gap, then the knot is tied with the lateral tail managed to the right side of the field.

The rhythm continues: place, draw through, tie, trim, reload. For example, after trimming the tails on a completed inferior stitch, the right hand reloads a fresh needle onto the driver, gripping at the proximal third, carefully rehoning the perpendicular approach to the next target at the superior end of the growing row. The left hand, now with forceps, takes the near margin to present the bite. The driver advances the needle in its arc, the far edge is everted for exit, the suture is pulled across, and the next knot is formed and cut. A short time later, with two knots now in place inferiorly, the needle is reloaded again in preparation for the next pass just above them; slack from the prior stitch is visible while the driver ensures the needle is secured in an optimal grip to begin the next bite.

Occasionally the operator pauses active driving to adjust or reload the needle entirely outside the wound. During one stretch, the curved needle is grasped in the driver above the field along the ruler margin—away from tissue—so the grip can be updated and the arc can be reoriented before advancing into the superior portion of the same slit. Elsewhere, the needle remains out of tissue during frames devoted to tightening a recently placed stitch or staging the next tie. These moments are purposeful; they keep bite placement and spacing consistent with what has already been laid down.

In the mid-to-upper third of the rightmost incision, the technique remains steady. The right hand frequently holds the needle driver during the actual passes, while the left hand uses Adson/tissue forceps to evert each edge in sequence—near edge for entry, far edge for exit—to achieve symmetric bites. The driver grasps the needle about two-thirds from the tip, and forehand bites are executed perpendicular to the skin. After partial passage, the driver regrips the needle to complete the arc without dragging or tearing. Once through, the suture is pulled across the gap, the loop is laid neatly, and instrument ties secure the stitch. In sequences devoted to tying, the driver may be used to hold the loop while the opposite hand tensions the free end; during later frames scissors enter to trim tails flush to the knot.

Approaching the superior quarter of the wound, a small series of steps repeats several times: a new bite is initiated at the top of the line, the suture is drawn through, and then tying and trimming follow. Sometimes, before taking another bite, the operator spends a moment managing the suture—drawing laterally to set tension or expose the next workspace—and instruments reposition just above the newly completed stitch. The hands remain close and parallel to the incision, careful not to cross unnecessarily. When the short end becomes very short, the left hand uses forceps to control it during tying, and then scissors cut it to a neat length.

With several evenly spaced stitches now in place inferiorly and midline, the wound edges at the superior end are approached with the same pattern: the driver is positioned just superior-lateral to the wound, the forceps stabilize the near margin, the needle enters perpendicularly, the arc carries it across the gap, and the far edge is everted for a clean exit. The suture is pulled through, and instrument ties are thrown to secure the knot. The developing row remains straight, and the bites maintain similar setback and depth across the incision’s length.

There are brief intervals when the operator pauses without penetrating tissue. For instance, at one point the needle is stabilized above the superior portion of the right-edge wound while the forceps control suture tails and the knot is snugged; scissors then cut the tails of that stitch and others along the line, leaving a series of tidy, short ends. In another short segment, both gloved hands move away from the pad as tools are exchanged and reloaded. The rightmost incision’s edges, by this time, are well approximated, and the superior segment shows slight puckering consistent with properly tensioned interrupted sutures nearing completion. The suture line is not disturbed during these exchanges; no new passes are made in those transient frames.

At one point near the end of the sequence there is a momentary hover over the leftmost slit: the left hand advances the needle driver toward the left incision while the right hand brings forceps to its margin. The edges are lightly apposed as if to set up an entry, but no bite is completed there. This is a brief exploratory motion or preparation that does not result in tissue penetration. No stitch is placed on the left; the previously sutured right-hand wound remains the sole line that receives actual bites and knots throughout the procedure.

The final operative actions return to the right-edge incision. A last set of tightening and tail cutting occurs at the superior end of this line. Forceps control the tails and lightly stabilize the wound edge while the most recent knot is snugged. Scissors then trim the excess. With this done, the instruments withdraw from the field. In the closing frames, the right-hand wound is seen with a short vertical column of simple interrupted stitches running from the inferior end toward the top. The knots lie lateral (to the patient’s right) of the incision, the edges are approximated along the entire length that was addressed, and the spacing and bite symmetry are consistent. The superior end shows edges approximated with minor, expected puckering related to recent placement and tensioning; there is no gaping, and no additional adjustments are made. The central and left slits remain unstitched and undisturbed.

Across the full sequence, the technique stays consistent with methodical, simple interrupted suturing and instrument ties:

- Edge handling: Forceps are used delicately on the dermis just back from the cut edge to achieve slight eversion without crushing. The operator alternates focus between the near and far edges to maintain symmetry on entry and exit.

- Needle handling: The needle is typically held at the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip in the driver, presented perpendicular to the skin surface. The driver follows the needle’s curvature; partial passages prompt a regrasp nearer the tip to complete the arc. Occasional hand-to-hand transfers or reloading above the field ensure optimal control for the next bite.

- Suture management: The standing end is kept lateral to the wound to avoid entanglement. During knot tying, the driver executes instrument ties while the opposing hand maintains appropriate tension and controls the short end. Tails are trimmed close to the knot after each stitch is secured, leaving a neat, low-profile line.

- Hand positioning: While dominance varies (at times the left hand drives and at other times the right hand drives), the spatial relationship remains constant. The driver generally approaches from a superior or superior-lateral position aligned with the incision; forceps oppose across the wound to present the edge. During tying and cutting, the instruments stay within a few millimeters of the wound, parallel to the line of closure.

- Progression: The closure starts at the inferior end of the rightmost slit and advances superiorly along the same line. Each new stitch is placed just above the last, with periodic pauses to seat knots and trim tails. There are no passes on any other incision, and moments when instruments hover elsewhere do not result in tissue penetration.

By the end, the right-edge incision stands closed over the treated segment with a tidy row of evenly spaced interrupted sutures. The edges are well approximated with slight eversion, and the knots are secure with short trimmed tails. The remainder of the pad—including the central and left slits—shows no change from the start. The procedure demonstrates a consistent, careful application of interrupted sutures along a single wound, from the initial inferior bite through the final tightening and trimming at the superior end, with disciplined instrument handling and suture management throughout.
