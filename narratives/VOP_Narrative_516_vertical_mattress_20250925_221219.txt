COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single vertical repair along the central incision of the practice pad — the middle of three parallel template cuts — and unfolds as a methodical series of interrupted skin sutures closing that single linear defect. From the outset the operator establishes a consistent two‑handed approach: a needle driver in the instrument‑bearing (dominant) hand controls the curved, swaged needle and a fine toothed tissue forceps in the other hand everts and stabilizes the wound edge. The work is performed on a synthetic dermal model without bleeding; movements are compact and bimanual, with instrument tips usually separated by only a few centimeters to permit fine needle guidance, tissue presentation and immediate suture management.

Initial needle passes and edge control
At the beginning of the video the operator approaches the central vertical wound with the needle driver held vertically over the incision and the forceps approaching from the lateral side. The curved needle is grasped close to the needle body (proximal to the swage) rather than at the extreme tip, and the driver is used in a standard in‑line grip. The needle is presented with its curvature oriented to carry the tip from the near side through to the far side of the incision. The non‑dominant forceps lifts and everts the near lip, exposing dermis for a shallow, controlled bite. Needle passage is accomplished with a wrist rotation following the curve of the needle; the tip is driven through in short arcs and withdrawn to leave a suture loop crossing the defect. Throughout these early passes the operator makes small, superficial-to-mid dermal bites intended to approximate epidermal and dermal layers without deep tissue purchase.

Formation and securing of individual interrupted stitches
Immediately after passing the needle, the operator transitions into suture management and knot formation. One hand organizes the suture loop and free limb while the other holds the forceps to maintain eversion and alignment. Knot formation is completed with instrument ties: the driver and forceps alternate to tension and seat the throws. The operator arranges and trims tails as needed, keeping the bites closely spaced to maintain even edge apposition. Between tied stitches, the wound shows slight eversion at each bite and occasional mild puckering at the center of the incision where previously placed sutures draw tissue together.

Sequential progression along the wound
Rather than working on multiple incisions, the repair is advanced along the length of the same central line. After establishing one or two initial stitches near the mid‑portion of the incision, the operator moves to adjacent gaps, placing additional interrupted stitches in a sequential, linear pattern. Needle handling remains consistent: the needle is re‑grasped in the driver near its mid‑shaft, the driver rotates the needle through a perpendicular-to‑oblique trajectory relative to the wound margin, and the forceps give counter‑traction and evert the opposite lip to present the dermis for accurate purchase. The hands often cross briefly above the incision as the driver and forceps converge on the same narrow working zone; the approach angle varies between approximately 30–60 degrees depending on which side of the bite is being entered and the orientation of the needle.

Technique refinement and consistent biomechanics
As the repair continues, the operator demonstrates repeated short, controlled bites — deliberate rotations of the needle driver that follow the needle curve rather than forcing its path — and consistent use of the forceps to stabilize and evert tissue before each pass. Instrument positions alternate: at times the driver approaches from above/medial or above/left and the forceps from the right/lateral side; at other moments those orientations reverse, but the functional relationship is preserved: the driver supplies needle control and rotation; the forceps supply tissue presentation, suture retrieval and temporary tensioning during knotting. Grip on the needle is almost uniformly proximal to mid‑shaft rather than at the very swage, giving the operator fine control of trajectory. Bites are shallow overall, largely engaging epidermal and dermal layers, with occasional passes that appear to include a bit more subdermal tissue — nonetheless the closure strategy centers on superficial approximation.

Working zones and movement along the incision
Throughout the mid‑procedure sequences the operator tightens and seats stitches in the midline and then progresses superiorly toward the remaining open gap at the superior end of the incision. The hands remain closely opposed to the wound; instrument tips are typically within 1–3 cm of each other and frequently cross above the incision when the needle is handed off or a bite is being completed. When addressing the superior gap, the team‑like coordination becomes more evident: one hand steadies and everts the superior edge while the other rotates the needle into the opposite lip, then pulls the suture loop through and sets up the knot. The sequential approach is deliberate and linear — the operator systematically fills the open segment of the tract by adding another interrupted stitch adjacent to the previously placed knots.

Knot management and suture tail handling
After each pass the emphasis turns quickly to knot formation and tail control. The left/right hand roles are complementary: the needle driver holds or tensions the suture while the forceps maintain edge apposition and manipulate tails. Knot formation is completed using instrument technique, with throws applied and seated until the wound edges approximate with slight eversion. The operator uses short, controlled movements to avoid excessive tension; the synthetic tissue is approximated snugly but not strangulated. After securing knots, suture tails are arranged, and in later frames scissors or an additional instrument is introduced to trim tails and tidy the repair. Near the end of the sequence the instruments are occasionally withdrawn and rested at the pad periphery, indicating completion of segments of the closure.

Variations and minor inconsistencies
Across the recording there are small inconsistencies and limitations to note. On rare frames the non‑dominant hand appears less uniformly gloved than the instrumented hand — a visual inconsistency in the simulation environment that does not change the technical sequence. Additionally, at times the bites are very shallow, producing limited deep tissue purchase; this is documented explicitly for one segment where the operator’s bites seemed to engage principally superficial dermis rather than a deeper dermal–subcuticular layer. That shallow depth produces predictable slight eversion and a mostly epidermal approximation, which is adequate for surface closure on the simulator but would be a point of attention in live tissue to ensure tension distribution and wound strength.

Final passes, superior segment closure and inspection
In the latter stages the operator focuses on the superiormost open segment of the incision. Needle passes become shorter and more controlled as the available working space narrows; the forceps lift and evert the tissue more prominently to present bite points for accurate needle entry. The driver approaches from slightly cranial positions at times, rotating the needle through short arcs to exit on the far side, then the suture is drawn through and prepared for tying. After seating that final stitch, the operator adjusts adjacent knots to achieve uniform apposition along the length of the repair, smoothing minor puckering and ensuring that spacing between stitches is even.

Final state and overall assessment
By the end of the recording the entire central vertical incision is closed with a continuous column of closely spaced interrupted stitches. Edges are uniformly approximated with slight outward eversion between bites, and the overall contour of the wound shows minor puckering centrally where earlier tensions concentrated — an expected cosmetic effect of closely spaced simple interrupted stitches on a simulated model. Instruments are withdrawn from the wound zone and held to the side; suture tails have been arranged and trimmed in the finishing frames. Spatially, the hands that began working from opposing sides of the incision have repeatedly converged over the midline, crossing briefly when necessary to pass or retrieve the needle, and then separated slightly after knotting to manage tails and inspect the repair.

Throughout the entire procedure the operator maintains a consistent pattern: controlled needle grasping near the shaft, rotational needle advancement through shallow-to-mid dermal bites, careful eversion and stabilization with fine forceps, and instrument‑tied interrupted knots to secure each bite. The technique remains stable from the first pass to the final knot — incremental refinements in bite control and edge presentation occur as the working field narrows, but the underlying mechanics do not change. The final closure is secure and cosmetically acceptable on the simulator: a clean, linear repair with evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures approximating the epidermal edges and providing continuous alignment along the entire length of the treated incision.
