Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your motion and flow are organized and deliberate: perpendicular entries, following the needleâ€™s arc, clean re-grasps near the tip, and smooth transitions into tying. Tension is balanced, slack is managed, and knots are centered without crowding. Hand coordination between needle driver and forceps is reliable, with consistent edge eversion and controlled delivery of the needle tip.
