Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
The work demonstrated a steady, reproducible motion pattern: consistent perpendicular needle loading, smooth wrist rotation to complete arcs, and predictable regrasping near the tip. Instrument ties were executed with a clear post and opposing vector, yielding flat, squared knots and a closure that maintained alignment. The sequence along the wound progressed in a logical inferior-to-superior rhythm, and the final row showed uniformity and control.
