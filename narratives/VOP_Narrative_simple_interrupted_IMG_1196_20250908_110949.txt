COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a synthetic skin pad with a straight central incision. The operator works primarily with a needle driver in the right hand, using the left hand for tissue forceps or to control suture ends. The flow throughout is a steady interrupted‑suture cadence: load the needle, take a bite with gentle eversion, pull the suture through, switch to instrument ties, seat the knot centrally with alternating throws, trim short tails, and move to the next site. The hands and instruments stay light on the tissue, with loops laid flat and tension applied symmetrically across the wound.

0–14 s: The right hand retrieves and orients the curved needle, grasping it at the proximal/middle third, perpendicular to the driver. The left hand brings in Adson forceps to evert and steady the near edge at the inferior third of the incision. The right wrist follows the needle’s arc to place the first bite into the near edge; control is maintained by brief regrips on the needle with the driver as it advances. The suture is managed to the right, away from the forceps tips, and only the first half of the simple interrupted passage is shown here.

15–29 s: Attention shifts from needle driving to securing the stitch. The needle is parked safely out of the immediate field while the right hand uses the driver as a knot pusher/grasper. The left hand alternates between forceps and fingers to control the short tail. The right hand forms instrument‑tie loops, captures the short end, and alternates throws while the left hand tensions the opposite strand. The edges approximate as the throws are cinched down over the center of the incision, with no crushing or excessive manipulation.

30–44 s: The instrument‑tie sequence continues smoothly. The right‑hand driver repeatedly grasps and releases the short end to advance alternating throws; the left hand maintains counter‑tension with fingers rather than forceps. The knot is seated squarely over the entry site, with tension applied in opposing directions to lay the loops flat.

45–59 s: The knot is secured and the right hand transitions to scissors to trim the tails. The left hand elevates/stabilizes the strands while the right hand approaches from the right, cutting close to the knot without contacting the skin. Scissors are then set aside. The driver remains the dominant tool in the right hand for subsequent steps.

60–74 s: The operator begins the next stitch. The right hand reloads the needle at the proximal third and approaches from the upper right. The left hand returns to Adson forceps to evert and steady the near edge during needle passage. The needle follows its curve through the tissue; the left forceps secure the emerging tip, then the right driver regrips to draw the suture through. With adequate tail length established, the driver pivots to instrument ties. Alternating throws are formed and snugged directly over the incision with flat, symmetrical tension.

75–89 s: Knot tying continues on this stitch. The needle remains out of the working zone on the long strand. The right‑hand driver captures the short end, the left hand controls the long end with fingers, and successive alternating throws are seated centrally. Tissue handling is minimal—only gentle approximation from the suture tension.

90–104 s: The right hand briefly switches to scissors to trim the completed knot, approaching from the right to cut close without touching tissue. After trimming, the right hand reloads the curved needle in the driver in preparation for the next pass, while the left hand moves in with forceps toward the wound to assist with the next bite.

105–119 s: A new interrupted stitch is placed near the superior portion of the wound. The needle is held near the distal two‑thirds from the tip—an appropriate grasp for control—and the left forceps stabilize and evert the near edge as the needle is delivered and then retrieved with the forceps. After the bite, the driver releases the needle and converts to knot tying, grasping the standing part and bringing the knot down over the incision while the left hand manages the short tail.

120–134 s: The operator completes the knot with a series of instrument ties. The left hand repositions the standing end to control direction, while the right‑hand driver forms loops, captures the free end, and seats each throw very close to the knot to maintain precision. The throws alternate to create square, secure knots, and the wound edges remain neatly approximated.

135–149 s: The sequence transitions to finishing and setup for the next stitch. Initially, the right hand uses scissors to trim tails adjacent to a completed knot while the left hand steadies the suture line with forceps. Both instruments are then withdrawn. The right hand picks up and loads a fresh needle, aligning it perpendicular in the jaws with the concavity oriented toward the wound. The left hand manages the suture tail and then reintroduces tissue forceps. The final frames show the driver poised on the right side of the pad and the left forceps ready on the left—set for the next bite.

150–164 s: The right hand drives the needle into the near dermis with a near‑perpendicular approach, guided by gentle eversion from the left forceps. The driver pronates to follow the curve, then regrips to complete the passage while keeping the needle’s trajectory perpendicular to the skin. The suture is drawn through, with the tail managed to the operator’s right. Tissue is handled delicately at the dermal margin without crushing.

165–179 s: With the stitch in place, the operator ties it. The needle itself is no longer used; the right‑hand driver works at the knot, grasping the free end after the left hand forms the loop. Throws alternate to create square knots, and the right hand maintains a position just superior‑right to the knot while the left hand stays inferior‑left, providing consistent counter‑tension. Each throw is snugged horizontally to approximate the edges without lifting the tissue.

180–185 s: The final knot is stabilized for trimming. The left hand, using the needle holder, tensions the suture just adjacent to the knot, and the right hand brings in straight scissors from the right. The blades are positioned close for a short‑tail cut, executed without disturbing the knot. Both instruments then withdraw, leaving a clear field and a row of neatly spaced simple interrupted sutures with centrally seated knots and short, tidy tails.

Across the full sequence, the technique demonstrates a disciplined rhythm: precise needle loading and perpendicular entries with forceps‑assisted eversion for each bite; a consistent switch to instrument ties with alternating, flat throws; careful, near‑knot tail trimming; and efficient hand choreography that keeps instruments clear of the wound except when necessary to seat a throw. The result is progressive, orderly approximation of the incision with minimal tissue trauma.
