Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Overall, the repair shows competent simple interrupted technique. Needle control is deliberate, with perpendicular approach and consistent bite depth, and tissue handling is generally respectful. The four stitches approximate the wound adequately with slight eversion and acceptable spacing. Efficiency and rhythm are the main liabilities. There is excessive setup, instrument swapping, and hesitation between steps, which interrupts flow and slows the repair. Improve by committing to each pass once the edge is presented, minimizing re-grasps, and maintaining a steady end‑to‑end sequence. Standardize knot tying to produce consistently square, flat knots and modulate tension to reduce puckering while preserving gentle eversion. With tighter execution and tempo, this would rise from adequate to strong.
