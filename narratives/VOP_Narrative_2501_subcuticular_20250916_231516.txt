COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
Overview and setup
The field contains a silicone skin pad with three vertical incisions: a far‑right vertical wound close to the pad’s right border; a central/midline slit slightly right of center; and a shorter right‑of‑center slit. From the earliest moments, it is evident that one incision—the far‑right vertical wound—receives repeated needle passes, ties, and housekeeping across the length of the clip collection, and is progressively closed with simple interrupted stitches. Other slits appear intermittently in short cutaways—one central and one short right‑of‑center—where single passes or a single knot are demonstrated, but those episodes are not continued. Consistent with the instruction to track a single line throughout, the narrative below follows the closure of the far‑right vertical incision with simple interrupted sutures. Where the camera briefly cuts to the other slits, those actions are described for completeness but treated as non‑progressing demonstrations separate from the ongoing closure.

Technique, orientation, and instrument handling
Throughout the closure of the far‑right wound, the operator uses a standard simple interrupted technique. The needle is typically grasped at about two‑thirds from its tip (or at the proximal third near the swage, depending on the exact clip), and is driven perpendicular to the skin surface in a controlled forehand arc. Tissue forceps are used to evert and stabilize the wound edges, with bites taken symmetrically and close to the margins. Knots are formed either with instrument ties (needle driver exchanging ends and forming square throws) or brief hand ties, and tails are trimmed with scissors. The hands commonly oppose each other across the wound—driver on one side, forceps on the other—meeting over the incision to pass the needle and then separating to pull the suture through and tie.

Chronological narrative of the closure

0–44 s: Brief cutaways to the central slit (not the line being closed)
The video opens not on the far‑right incision, but on the central/midline slit. At 0–14 s, the left hand holds the needle driver and the right hand uses tissue forceps to evert the right edge. A full pass is made across this midline wound, but tying is not completed. At 15–29 s, the right hand now holds the driver and positions a bite across the same central slit; the left assists by tensioning the strand. By 30–44 s, the bite across the midline slit has been advanced and tensioned and knot tying is initiated but not completed. These central sequences show good fundamentals—perpendicular needle orientation and controlled arc—but they are not continued and do not progress a closure; the camera soon shifts to the far‑right incision where the ongoing closure continues and remains the focus thereafter.

45–74 s: Returning to the far‑right incision to build the row distally
With the camera back on the far‑right incision (45–59 s), four completed simple interrupted stitches are visible along this wound. The left hand holds a needle driver above and slightly left of the right wound edge while the right hand stabilizes the lateral edge and manages the free suture. The needle is oriented perpendicular and positioned to enter from the right wound edge toward the left, setting up the next stitch in the existing row.

From 60–74 s, the right hand predominantly holds the needle driver over the right‑side incision, and the left hand alternates between forceps (to present the edge) and scissors (to trim after tying). The driver rotates the needle through the near edge to the far edge in a smooth arc. After passage, knot tying is performed and scissors are brought in to trim, advancing the closure at the lower portion of the slit. The stitch count at this stage rises beyond the initial four; the fifth is in progress and then secured and dressed.

75–89 s: Another brief interlude on the central slit
There is a short return to the untouched central incision where the left hand holds the needle holder and the right hand everts the right margin in preparation for a first pass. No stitch is completed in this interlude; the camera promptly returns to the right‑side wound.

90–119 s: Consolidating the lower end on the far‑right wound
At 90–104 s, activity resumes on the far‑right incision. The left hand brings the needle driver in from the upper‑left toward the lower end of the wound while the right hand uses tissue forceps to evert the right edge. A new stitch is placed and tied at the inferior end; scissors then cut the tails. Before this placement, a row of completed stitches is already present; after tying and cutting, the line shows the additional knot. The exact running tally fluctuates by camera angle in these cut sequences, but functionally another simple interrupted stitch has been added and secured.

Between 105–119 s, work continues at the inferior portion. The right hand alternates between forceps and the needle driver near the right edge, while the left hand intermittently holds scissors or forceps. The needle is oriented perpendicular to the pad and positioned to take the next bite through the lower end of the wound; this segment shows setup and needle positioning rather than knot completion. The already placed stitches keep the edges well approximated as the next bite is planned.

120–134 s: A single knot tied on the central slit (demonstration, not continued)
The camera cuts once more to the midline slit. Here the right hand manipulates the driver while the left hand uses pickups to manage the short tail. The sequence is dedicated to instrument ties, and by the end there is exactly one completed interrupted suture on the central slit. The operator then leaves this line and does not return to continue it; the main closure proceeds on the far‑right wound.

135–179 s: Building and securing the mid‑to‑lower series on the far‑right wound
At 135–149 s, the operator places another simple interrupted stitch in the lower third of the right‑side incision. The left hand (needle driver) works medial to the incision and the right hand (forceps) stabilizes the lateral edge. The needle is grasped at about two‑thirds from the tip, passes in a perpendicular arc, and the suture is drawn through; tying is deferred in this short clip. Visible along the line are several completed stitches; this pass adds the next one in series.

The next two clips (150–164 s and 165–179 s) show tightening, positioning, and trimming of knots along the midline of this same right‑side incision. The left hand often holds the needle holder over the wound; the right hand alternates between Adsons to manage the edge and scissors to trim. One additional stitch is tied and its ends are cut, advancing the count along the mid‑portion. The technique remains consistent—square knots are seated with gentle approximation, maintaining mild eversion without blanching.

180–194 s: A central slit pass (again not progressed)
The camera briefly returns to the central/midline incision, where the left hand drives a perpendicular arc while the right hand everts the right edge with forceps. A new pass is taken across this central slit without tying in the clip. This remains a teaching cutaway; there is no continuation of this central line in the overall sequence.

195–239 s: Middle and superior progression on the far‑right line
Back to the far‑right incision, the next series of clips (195–209 s, 210–224 s, and 225–239 s) depict steady mid‑to‑upper progression using simple interrupted stitches. The left hand generally holds the needle driver over the wound, with the right hand using tissue forceps to evert and stabilize the right edge. Bites are taken symmetrically across the center of the incision (195–209 s), a new bite is placed mid‑incision and the suture is drawn through (210–224 s), and then a new interrupted stitch is placed and tied in the superior segment (225–239 s). Through these sequences, the previously placed knots remain aligned and the wound edges stay nicely approximated with mild eversion. Instrument ties are clean and square; the driver alternates between grasping the needle and using it as a tying instrument to cinch throws.

240–269 s: Preparing additional superior bites on the far‑right line
From 240–254 s and 255–269 s, the operator prepares and then advances the next interrupted stitch near the superior half of the right‑side incision. The right hand holds the needle driver lateral/right of the wound, while the left hand uses forceps to lift the near edge for a controlled, perpendicular entry. The needle is re‑grasped to complete the exit on the far side. These segments show positioning and passage; tying is not completed within these clips, but the row remains orderly and well approximated.

270–284 s: Taking the next bite at the top of the far‑right wound
At 270–284 s, the needle holder works from the left/superior aspect of the right‑side wound, while the right hand uses forceps to evert the right wound edge near the top. The needle is driven across the apex, sequentially through both edges, and the suture is pulled through. Four completed stitches are visible below this working area; the newly passed upper bite becomes the next stitch in the series (its knot will be tied in subsequent clips).

285–299 s and 300–314 s: A brief pass across a short right‑of‑center slit, then back to tying on a partly closed vertical line
At 285–299 s, the camera shows a short vertical slit just right of center (immediately left of the far‑right wound). The forceps evert the right dermal edge and a controlled bite is taken across this small slit; no knot is tied. This appears to be another cutaway to a different incision, not the main right‑side line.

At 300–314 s, the scene shifts to a vertical wound right‑of‑center that is already partly closed with simple interrupted knots. A new stitch is placed and tied in a central gap, bringing the visible count on that line from four to five within the clip. This resembles the technique used on the far‑right wound, but given the consistent focus of the ongoing closure, we treat this as a similar demonstration on a neighboring slit. The operator immediately returns to the far‑right incision thereafter for continued tying and housekeeping.

315–359 s: Tying and finishing near the top of the far‑right incision
Across 315–329 s, the left hand uses a needle driver to perform instrument ties over the superior portion of the far‑right incision while the right hand holds tissue forceps, elevating the short end as needed. The driver does not drive the needle here; it is used to alternately grasp and release the long end during throws. Four completed stitches are visible in the mid‑portion, with the uppermost new stitch being tied during these frames.

At 345–359 s, the driver is briefly used to withdraw the needle through the upper portion, then set aside to perform hand ties. The left hand stabilizes the wound with forceps as the right hand forms loops; the knot is seated squarely at the superior end of the same wound. Before this tying, four completed stitches are visible; after tying in these frames, five completed stitches are present.

330–344 s and 360–374 s: Two more short returns to the central slit
In between the tying sequences on the far‑right wound, two short clips return to the central incision. At 330–344 s, the central short vertical wound shows a series of small dermal puckers that read as a running sequence in progress; no knots are visible. Given the remainder of the footage is entirely simple interrupted on the far‑right wound, this isolated appearance of a “running” look on the central slit is inconsistent with the primary technique and appears to be a demonstration or artifact of tension on a strand rather than a change in method on the main line. At 360–374 s, only one completed knot is visible at the top of the central slit, and the left hand tightens both strands without instrument assistance; again, this line is not progressed elsewhere and remains a single‑knot demonstration.

375–404 s: Final tying and housekeeping at the superior end of the far‑right line
At 375–389 s, attention is again on the far‑right incision. Five completed simple interrupted stitches are visible along the wound; the left hand manages the running end/needle and the right hand positions the driver obliquely across the top, setting up to place or finalize another stitch at the superior end. No new penetration is shown in this clip; it focuses on tensioning and preparation.

Then at 390–404 s, the left hand uses the needle driver as a tying instrument to secure the topmost stitch with successive instrument throws while the right hand (forceps) gently stabilizes the superior wound edge and manages the short tail. The knot is cinched down squarely onto the top stitch, and when this sequence finishes, five completed interrupted sutures are visible along the right‑side incision.

405–414 s: Tail trimming at the top of the far‑right incision; final count visible
In the final view (405–414 s), the right hand re‑enters from above with scissors or the needle driver to perform tail trimming/housekeeping near the superior end. There is no new penetration; the tissue interaction is minimal, consistent with cutting tails on a stitch that has already been tied. In this last angle, four completed interrupted sutures are clearly visible along the far‑right incision. This is the best final confirmation of the visible count at the conclusion of the procedure.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
- Lower third closures (45–119 s): The driver and forceps straddle the incision closely. The driver is commonly medial/left of the slit, advancing the needle forehand across, while the opposite hand everts the lateral/right edge. After passage, the driver is used for instrument ties and scissors are introduced to trim. The hands remain close to the wound, crossing briefly over the midline of the slit to seat knots.

- Mid‑portion consolidation (135–179 s): The same opposing-hand pattern continues. Forceps pick up the edge to evert and guide penetration depth; the driver maintains a near‑perpendicular needle orientation. During knot tying and trimming, the driver alternates between holding the long end and forming throws while the forceps or fingers hold the short end.

- Central to superior progression (195–269 s): The left hand often controls the driver above the wound while the right hand elevates the right margin with forceps. Bites are evenly spaced with symmetrical depth on each side of the incision. As the work climbs toward the superior half, the hands climb with it, maintaining an opposing stance across the wound for precise entry‑exit alignment.

- Apex tying and finishing (270–404 s): Near the top of the wound, the driver is used first to complete the pass and then as a tying instrument. On some throws, the driver crosses transversely over the wound toward the assistant hand to shuttle the loop; on others, the hands switch for hand ties. The right hand intermittently stabilizes the superior margin with forceps and holds the short tail to present the knot. Final housekeeping brings the tails crisp to length.

Technique consistency and brief deviations on other slits
The far‑right wound is closed with simple interrupted sutures throughout its appearance. Bites remain perpendicular, symmetric, and at consistent depth; each knot is secured with appropriate tension to approximate without blanching. The cutaways to the central and short right‑of‑center slits do not progress their closure and appear as discrete demonstrations: a single stitch placed and tied centrally, an unknotted pass, and one segment that transiently looks like a running sequence on the central slit. That isolated “running” appearance stands in contrast to the otherwise uniform use of simple interrupted stitches on the main wound and is treated as a non‑progressing vignette.

Suture progression and counts across the main wound
Because the footage is compiled from multiple short clips and shifts framing, the number of completed stitches visible at any given interlude varies slightly with camera angle. What is clear in terms of progression on the far‑right incision is:
- The line begins in view with four completed simple interrupted stitches already present (45–59 s).
- A new stitch is passed and tied at the inferior end (60–74 s), advancing the line.
- Another stitch is placed and tied inferiorly (90–104 s), and tails are cut.
- Additional stitches are placed and/or tied through the mid‑portion (135–179 s), with trimming.
- One or more stitches are placed and tied in the central/superior segments (195–239 s), using instrument ties.
- The topmost stitch is passed (270–284 s) and subsequently tied (315–359 s and 390–404 s), with housekeeping and tail trimming at the end (405–414 s).

MANDATORY SUTURE COUNT VERIFICATION
- Final visible count: In the last available frames (405–414 s), four completed interrupted sutures are clearly visible along the far‑right incision. This is the definitive count at the conclusion of the procedure based on the final view.
- How the count changed: The line is first shown with four completed knots. Through the middle of the case, additional stitches are clearly placed and tied at lower, central, and upper segments, and several clips show five completed stitches at intermediate time points (and even six in one lower‑end close‑up). However, by the final camera angle—focused on trimming at the superior end—only four completed stitches are plainly seen in the field. Given the instruction to report what is actually visible in the final frames, the procedure is concluded with four completed stitches visible on the far‑right incision.

Final state
The far‑right incision lies approximated with mild dermal eversion and a neat row of simple interrupted knots. Tails have been trimmed after the last tie near the superior end. Exactly four completed interrupted sutures are visible in the final view. The central/midline slit and the short right‑of‑center slit show brief, non‑progressing demonstrations (including a single knot on the central slit), but they are not carried forward; the continuous, complete work in this sequence is the simple interrupted closure of the far‑right wound.

Key technical features preserved throughout
- Needle handling: Consistently grasped around the proximal third to two‑thirds from the tip, driven perpendicular to the pad with smooth forehand arcs. Re‑grasping is performed to complete exits cleanly.
- Tissue handling: Forceps gently evert edges, avoiding crush. Bites are symmetric and near the margins; depth is consistent for reliable approximation.
- Knot technique: Instrument ties predominate at mid and upper segments; occasional hand ties are used. Throws are squared and cinched down with balanced traction on standing and free ends.
- Spatial choreography: The driver and pickups oppose across the wound, converge for passage, then separate for pull‑through and tying. At the apex, the driver crosses transversely as a tying tool while the assistant hand steadies the tail and tissue.
- Line discipline: Work proceeds segment by segment from lower through central to superior portions of the same right‑side incision, returning for housekeeping and tail trimming at the end.

Conclusion
Across this multi‑clip sequence, the surgeon demonstrates a methodical simple interrupted closure of the far‑right vertical incision, supplemented by brief, non‑continuing demonstrations on other slits. The far‑right wound is closed with careful perpendicular bites, good tissue eversion, and square, well‑seated knots. Although intermediate clips at different magnifications show varying numbers of knots because of framing and timing, the final confirmatory view shows four completed interrupted sutures in place. The wound edges are aligned without excessive tension, the tails are trimmed, and the line is left neat and evenly spaced. The procedure resulted in 4 completed sutures visible in the final frames.
