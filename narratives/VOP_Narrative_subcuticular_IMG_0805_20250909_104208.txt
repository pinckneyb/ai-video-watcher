COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence documents a single, continuous closure of the short vertical wound on the left side of the suture pad. The central column with pre-existing stitches is never manipulated, and the right-side slit remains untouched throughout. All activity focuses on the leftmost vertical laceration, progressing from its inferior end upward toward the superior end, using simple interrupted technique with careful edge eversion and orthogonal needle passage.

The video opens with the team establishing the first stitch at the very bottom of the left wound. The right hand holds the needle driver; the left hand, with Adson forceps, picks up and everts the inferior right lip to expose dermis and define bite placement. The curved needle is held approximately two-thirds from the tip, set nearly perpendicular to the skin. With a short, controlled wrist motion, the driver advances the needle through the left (near) edge at the inferior end, then across toward the opposite lip. The left hand maintains the wound open and everted, offering the dermal edge to the needle’s arc while the driver regrips the needle tip to follow through and pull the suture. At this stage, the strand is drawn across without any knot tying; they are still setting up the geometry and depth of the first pass.

They continue to work in this lower third of the incision, keeping the needle orthogonal to the skin and reloading it frequently to preserve the right angle of approach and an even arc through the dermis. The operator alternates the assisting hand between tissue forceps for edge control and managing the free suture tail to avoid slack and tangles. The near edge is taken first, the far edge second, following the curve smoothly. The forceps occasionally stabilize the far (medial) lip from inside the wound to keep the bite symmetric and avoid skiving the dermal margin. The needle driver often approaches from a left/lower-left trajectory, while the forceps hover more medially/superiorly, so that the instruments meet just above the wound as each pass is completed. In these early passes, several entries and exits are made but no knots are thrown; the operator is working deliberately to obtain consistent bite depth and spacing on the first stitch at the inferior end.

As the initial passes proceed, the left hand and right hand swap roles at times. In some shots the left hand carries the needle driver from the lateral side, while the right hand uses forceps to evert either the near or far lip. The curved needle is repeatedly regripped—sometimes the forceps briefly steady the needle itself—to maintain precise control of its path. Scissors make a brief appearance to help manage tension in the suture strand, but there is no cutting this early on. The primary goal remains: orthogonal entry, good dermal purchase, and exteriorized exits at equivalent distances from the wound on each side to encourage eversion and smooth approximation once tied.

By the time the view returns to the left incision later, the lower portion of the wound shows the effect of these early efforts: two simple interrupted sutures have been completed and are already approximating the edges. The operator now works slightly higher—toward the mid to superior segment of the same left wound—repeating the same methodical steps. The needle is grasped in the proximal third, perpendicular to the pad, and is driven through the far lip first in some frames, with forceps stabilizing the tissue and guiding the tip as it emerges. The driver then regrips the needle to complete the arc through the near lip, drawing the suture across the wound. The assisting hand alternates between lifting the wound edge and assisting with needle retrieval, keeping the edges everted with gentle, tooth-on-dermis contact and avoiding crush.

Progress continues toward the top of the wound. In one sequence, three interrupted stitches are already visible along the midportion of the left incision. The operator sets up another bite at the superior end, consistent with an inferior-to-superior closure strategy. The left hand holds the needle driver just lateral to the apex of the wound. The right hand, with toothed forceps, elevates the right lip near the planned bite site to evert and present dermis. The needle is grasped a bit nearer the tip now (distal third) to allow a crisp, perpendicular entry on the left edge near the superior end. The bite traverses the dermal thickness and exits the right side at a mirror distance from the margin, again prioritizing symmetry and eversion. The driver regrips the needle to complete the exit, and the suture is drawn through. At this stage, loops form as they begin to manage the strand, but tying has not yet begun in those frames; the stitch at the top is still “in progress.”

As they prepare to secure the superior stitch, the camera tightens its focus to the upper end of the wound. The left hand remains on the needle driver; the right hand uses the forceps to lightly grasp an adjacent edge and to guide the needle and strand. The driver holds the needle near one-third from the swage, and the long end of the suture is pulled superiorly and slightly lateral to seat the pass without strangling tissue. Under this magnified view, only the superior knot and its immediate suture course is in prominent view; previously placed stitches fall largely out of frame. The operator tightens the throw, aligning edge eversion and tension, ensuring that the suture approximates without blanching or inverting the lip.

The next segment shows instrument tying at the superior end. The curved needle is largely parked, and attention shifts to the mechanics of the knot. The right hand secures the short tail with forceps while the left hand, alternating between needle driver and scissors, completes the sequence of throws. The knot is laid down just medial to the wound edge, with the right hand gently stabilizing the tissue as each throw is seated. The operator avoids rocking the edges; the knot is coaxed into place with a downward, even motion that coapts the epidermal surfaces while maintaining the dermal eversion achieved during passage. Once satisfied with the security and position, the left hand brings in scissors and trims the ends to an appropriate length.

With the superior stitch tied and trimmed, the full wound again comes into view. Three completed simple interrupted sutures are visible along the left incision, now mostly approximated with clean, symmetric bites. The spacing appears regular, and all three knots are positioned just off the wound line, avoiding interference with epidermal apposition. The edges remain gently everted, indicating that the bites were properly balanced across dermal thickness. There is no manipulation of the central column of old sutures, and the right-hand vertical slit remains untouched.

In the final moments, the operator positions the needle again at the very top, as if preparing for a subsequent stitch above the current series. The left hand alternates between forceps and driver near the left lip, while the right hand holds a driver and the running suture superior-right of the wound. The needle’s tip is poised just above the superior portion of the left incision, aligned perpendicular to the pad, ready for a right-to-left pass. Crucially, no new knot is tied in this closing sequence. The wound still shows exactly three completed interrupted sutures in place as the segment ends.

Hand use and spatial relationships evolve naturally through the procedure. Early on, the right hand often drives the needle from the lateral/inferolateral side while the left hand everts the near and far edges; later, the left hand frequently carries the driver with the right hand handling forceps. This switching reflects the need to maintain an orthogonal needle path and to deliver the needle safely and efficiently on whichever side offers the best angle. The instruments repeatedly cross just above the wound—driver advancing from one side, forceps presenting from the other—meeting over the incision as the needle emerges. The assisting hand controls the suture tail when needed, keeping slack minimal and preventing it from snagging the driver or the forceps. In tying sequences, the right hand often stabilizes the short tail or an adjacent skin edge with forceps while the left hand uses the driver as a tying instrument, then introduces scissors to trim.

Technique remains consistent throughout. Every bite is oriented perpendicular to the skin, with the needle held at the proximal or distal third to optimize leverage and precision. The operator uses short wrist motions to follow the curve, regripping the needle as needed to maintain a smooth arc through dermal tissue. Forceps are applied just back from the wound edge, on dermis rather than epidermis, to avoid crushing the edge and to encourage eversion. The suture is drawn through with measured traction, avoiding undue tension on fragile edges. Knots are laid deliberately with attention to positioning and edge alignment; trimming is performed only after knot security and tissue coaptation are confirmed.

The pattern of suture placement is straightforward: the closure begins at the inferior third of the left wound and progresses proximally. Early frames chronicle multiple needle passes without knot tying as the operator establishes consistent bite depth and symmetry on the first stitch. In mid-procedure, two completed sutures are observed securing the lower segment; work then shifts to the mid and superior segments where additional stitches are placed. At one point three completed sutures are visible in the midportion while another pass is being placed at the top. The superior-most stitch is then tightened and tied. After trimming, the wound is shown with three completed simple interrupted sutures in place, and the operator positions the needle for a potential additional pass above, but no further knots are tied before the video ends.

Suture count verification and progression:
- Early sequences (0–104 s): multiple passes are performed on the left wound, but no knots are tied yet; completed sutures visible: 0.
- Mid sequences (105–119 s): the left wound displays two completed simple interrupted sutures; a new stitch is being placed higher up.
- Subsequent sequences (120–149 s): three completed sutures are visible along the same left wound while another stitch is in progress near the superior end; tying has not yet been shown in those frames.
- Tying sequences (150–179 s): the superior stitch is tightened, secured, and trimmed. After this, the wound shows three completed interrupted sutures.
- Final frames (180–184 s): exactly three completed interrupted sutures remain visible; a new bite is being lined up at the top, but no additional knot is completed.

Final outcome:
- The procedure results in three completed simple interrupted sutures on the left vertical wound. The edges are neatly approximated with preserved eversion, the knots are seated just off the wound line, and spacing is regular. The central column with older sutures remains undisturbed, and the right-side slit is not addressed. The video concludes as the operator prepares for another pass at the superior end, but the count of completed sutures remains at three.
