COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a suturing practice pad with three parallel vertical incisions. Work throughout centers on the right‑side vertical wound near the pad’s right border. The centrally located incision already shows completed sutures at the outset and is not part of the closure being performed here; it is occasionally adjusted or tensioned in brief interludes but no new bites are driven there during the main sequence. The leftmost incision appears only momentarily at the very end without any stitch being placed. The active closure proceeds along the right‑most wound from its upper half down into the lower portion and then back toward the superior end, using consistent technique and instrument choreography to achieve eversion and approximation with simple interrupted stitches.

The sequence begins with the wound still open. At the very start, the surgeon is building the first passes on the right‑side incision. The right hand manipulates a needle driver carrying a curved needle; the left hand holds Adson forceps that gently lift and present the wound edge. The needle is mounted about one‑third to two‑thirds from its tip, with the concavity oriented to follow the arc perpendicularly through the skin. The left hand everts the near edge, aligning the dermal margin; the right hand advances the needle in a controlled, wrist‑driven arc across the gap. Suture trails behind as the needle is retrieved and the strand is pulled through without tying yet. The hands straddle the incision in opposition, working with the driver approaching from the left/central pad toward the right border, and the forceps controlling the right lip.

Immediately after, the surgeon completes an early stitch in the superior portion of the right wound and performs an instrument tie to secure the first knot. The needle has been passed through both sides of the incision, leaving two free suture limbs. The right hand with the driver and the left hand managing the free end cross above the wound center to square and seat the knot. The knot cinches the edges together neatly at the wound’s upper segment, and the sequence then returns to taking subsequent bites.

Progress continues as a new stitch is placed near the upper end of the same incision. In one sequence, the left hand alone is visible with the needle driver; the right hand manages the free suture end rather than tissue. Without forceps, tissue presentation relies briefly on strand tension and the inherent stiffness of the synthetic pad. The needle is grasped at the proximal third and kept perpendicular to the skin, and the driver rotates to follow the curve as the needle passes from one edge to the other. The suture is pulled through and organized for the next pass.

The operator then returns to the more typical, two‑handed approach with forceps on the right edge and the driver approaching from the left. The right‑hand forceps evert and stabilize the right wound lip at a consistent distance from the margin. The left hand with the driver drives the needle across the defect with a perpendicular trajectory, following the arc through dermis and out the opposite side. The suture is drawn through smoothly, the loop lying across the pad. The technique emphasizes symmetric, small bites with the driver often regripped to maintain a true arc and to retrieve the needle efficiently from the exit point. During these early passes, hand dominance occasionally alternates; in one segment the right hand holds the needle driver and the left hand manipulates the forceps, but angles and instrument relationships remain consistent—one hand presents and everts a wound edge while the other advances the needle at roughly 60–90 degrees to the incision.

Between passes, the surgeon often pauses to reload the needle. Reloading is deliberate: the left hand repositions the needle in the jaws at the proximal third, optimizing it for the next forehand pass. The right hand either holds the forceps lightly to aid positioning or briefly touches the needle body to guide the curve without crushing tissue. Suture slack is tensioned and organized so loops don’t obscure the field. The wound’s edges are not overly manipulated; forceps tips are placed just at the dermal margin, and eversion is achieved by gentle lifting rather than pinching or crushing.

Work proceeds to the lower half of the right incision. The left hand now holds the needle driver over the lower portion while the right hand maintains the far/right edge with the forceps. The needle is again aligned perpendicular to the skin. Entry and exit points remain symmetric, with the tip guided by subtle pronation and supination of the driver hand. The forceps stay just ahead of the needle path to keep the dermis presented; the driver traverses the wound, maintaining depth consistency. The suture is pulled through fully and reloaded for the next bite.

As the closure advances along the right wound’s length, the approach alternates between initiating passes and completing them. In one passage, the needle is driven through the right edge and delivered into the wound, leaving a tail as the strand is drawn through; the opposite edge is then aligned for the return bite. After crossing both sides, the driver is sometimes parked while the surgeon swaps to the same driver for tying, completing an interrupted stitch midline on the right wound. The forceps continue to cradle and evert the edges during knot seating to maintain eversion as the throw cinches down. Scissors appear briefly in the left hand for readiness but are not always used immediately; they are set aside when tying begins.

Further along the same incision, the surgeon places additional passes with consistent technique. At times, the right hand with forceps also assists with the needle itself—briefly grasping its body to control exit, then handing it back to the driver for regrasping nearer the swage to pull the suture through. The left hand maintains control of the driver, and the needle is reloaded promptly to keep pace with the closure line. The working angles remain disciplined: the driver crosses from the left of the wound to the right, and the forceps hold the right edge near the bite site, with both instrument tips converging millimeters from the incision.

Mid‑procedure, the surgeon’s sequence shows preparatory movements for new bites—aligning the needle perpendicularly, lifting the right wound lip with the forceps, and tenting tissue to expose the dermal entry point. In these frames, no passage occurs; they represent the careful setup that precedes each precise bite. Suture loops are kept to the right side and superiorly to avoid entanglement. The forceps alternate lifting the far and near edges to present consistent entry and exit points at equal distances from the margin. The result is a series of evenly spaced, symmetric bites that gently evert the skin and narrow the gap without undue traction.

The middle third of the incision receives several additional interrupted stitches with the same pattern. The left hand with the driver spans horizontally across the right incision, and the right hand with forceps continues to work from the wound’s right margin. The needle is passed through, the suture is drawn across, and then reloaded. The surgeon often grasps the needle near its tip with the driver late in the pass to complete extraction cleanly, then repositions the needle to prepare for the next throw. These maneuvers maintain the needle’s curvature and minimize torque on the tissue.

Occasionally the surgeon pauses to manage suture slack alone without placing a new bite. In one such instance near the superior end of the right wound, only the left hand is visible. The driver follows along the suture strand to tension and lay the loop neatly, drawing the thread through a previously placed pass. No forceps assist in that moment; tissue handling relies on the stability provided by prior bites and the inherent stiffness of the synthetic pad. This maintains an organized field and keeps the subsequent pass uncontaminated by loops or crossing strands.

The closure sequence then returns to the top of the right wound where additional stitches are placed. The left hand holds the driver horizontally over the superior end, and the right hand lifts the top of the right wound edge with the forceps to present the bite. The needle is again grasped at the proximal one‑third to one‑half, concavity facing the wound, and driven through with the driver following its curve. The forceps briefly control the needle tip as it exits to avoid sudden jumps or deep grabs, then the suture is drawn through. Immediately after, another pass is initiated at the very top; the driver releases and regrips the needle near its tip mid‑pass to maintain the natural arc and avoid levering the needle. This regrasp completes a smooth exit; the suture is pulled through the superior portion of the wound.

Two brief interludes occur in which the central midline incision is handled separately. In one, the left hand with a needle driver manipulates a strand over the midline where several simple interrupted stitches are already present. The motion appears to be tensioning and positioning of a loop at the superior end without a new pass. Later, a knot is formed and seated at the top of the central line, again without any new bites. These short segments do not add stitches to the right‑side wound and serve as housekeeping on a previously sutured line before the surgeon’s focus returns to the right incision.

Back on the right side, work resumes at the superior portion. The left hand with the driver returns to a near‑perpendicular stance over the wound apex; the right hand’s forceps gently lift the lateral lip to present a clean entry. One stitch at the top is completed and tied: the driver holds one limb, the right hand manages the other, and the knot is cinched and squared over the wound center. Scissors then come in from the left to trim the ends while the right hand maintains mild tension on the tail. The edges at the apex are neatly approximated, and the knot sits properly without crushing adjacent tissue.

With the superior knot secured, the surgeon prepares to place another bite at the top. The forceps elevate the right lip; the driver repeatedly adjusts to maintain a perpendicular approach. The needle is presented and positioned, but the pass is not completed in those frames; they represent the careful setup for the next stitch. Immediately following, there is a setup sequence in which the needle is transferred by the right hand and recaptured by the left‑hand driver at the correct grip point (proximal third). Both hands briefly leave the field and return, reflecting the fluid, ergonomic repositioning between passes that keeps the needle properly oriented and the working angles optimal.

There are a few additional moments away from the right incision. One shows the already approximated central incision with a running strand lying along it; the needle is held above the wound without any new bite, and no advancement of the running line is seen. Another brief segment at the very end shows the left hand alone positioning the needle over the left‑of‑center incision’s superior segment, but no pass is executed there. These incidental moments do not interrupt or change the progress achieved on the right‑side closure.

Throughout the entire closure on the right wound, several technique features remain consistent:

- Needle control and orientation: The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid‑shaft and kept nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. As the needle emerges, the driver often regrips closer to the tip to complete the arc without levering against tissue. This preserves the needle’s trajectory and reduces tissue trauma.

- Tissue handling and eversion: The forceps reliably lift and evert the dermal edges just enough to present the bite without crushing. Eversion is achieved by precise tip placement at or near the dermal margin, ensuring epidermal edges oppose properly when tied. When forceps are not used in a frame, eversion and stability rely on the stiffness of the pad and on suture traction from prior bites.

- Entry/exit symmetry and depth control: Bites are kept small and symmetric on either side of the wound at consistent distances from the edge, maintaining even depth through the dermis. The arcs remain perpendicular to the incision; instruments converge in opposing positions to keep the plane of the pass controlled and predictable.

- Suture management: Slack is controlled by pulling the strand through immediately after each pass and then organizing it superiorly or to the right side of the field. The driver sometimes tracks along the strand to remove loops and lay the suture neatly, preventing tangles during subsequent passes. When tying, the surgeon alternates hand roles as needed to square knots in the center of the wound.

- Hand and instrument choreography: The driver typically approaches from the left or central area across to the right wound edge while forceps work at the right lip. Hands remain within a few centimeters of the wound, crossing over the incision during tying and sometimes switching instrument roles during passes. Angles are kept around 60–90 degrees relative to the wound, ensuring vertical needle paths and predictable bite geometry.

As the procedure advances, interrupted stitches progressively approximate the right‑side wound from the mid and lower segments up toward the top. Several stitches are clearly tied—one in the early superior portion and another centrally—with others passed and left for subsequent tying in adjacent frames. The superior apex ultimately receives a fresh, well‑seated knot, and scissors trim the ends. Intervening frames show methodical preparation for subsequent superior bites, indicating the operator is finalizing the closure at the top.

By the end of the documented sequence, the right‑side incision has been substantially closed with evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures. The edges are approximated with gentle eversion and without evidence of crush injury. The superior apex has a recently placed, square knot with neatly trimmed tails. Additional preparatory movements at the top suggest the operator intends to place further stitches just beyond the last shown tie, but within the seen portion, the line is already well approximated along much of its length with consistent technique. Brief appearances of work on other incisions represent momentary organization or housekeeping and do not alter the continuous progression of the right‑side closure. The overall result is a tidy, methodical approximation of the right vertical wound, achieved through careful needle control, disciplined tissue handling, and reliable interrupted knot tying.
