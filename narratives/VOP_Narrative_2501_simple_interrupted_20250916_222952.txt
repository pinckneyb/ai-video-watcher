COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses exclusively on closing the rightmost vertical skin slit on a three‑incision practice pad. From the first frames to the last, the operator works only on this far‑right wound, progressively building a line of simple interrupted sutures from the middle portion upward, with occasional adjustments and trimming, and no work on the two central slits at any time.

The sequence begins with setup and the very first bite. At the outset (0–14 s), the right‑most vertical slit is intact with no sutures. The left hand holds the needle holder just left of the slit, the right hand stabilizes the right wound margin with forceps and everts it gently. The curved needle is loaded about two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin, and is aimed to enter the epidermis at the right edge. The needle is driven into the right wound edge to start the first pass; no exit or tying is shown yet. This continues in the next interval (15–29 s) where the same incision is engaged: the first bite is being passed across and the suture drawn through, with forceps on the right edge presenting the tissue and the driver advancing the needle from right to left. Still, no knot is tied within these frames.

In the subsequent interval (30–44 s), the operator completes and ties that first stitch. The right hand maintains the needle driver lateral and just superior to the wound, the left hand steadies the tissue and assists in approximating the silicone edges. After passing the needle through both sides, suture is pulled across the gap, a loop is formed, and instrument ties are thrown to seat the knot. By the end of this sequence, one completed stitch with a visible knot is present at mid‑height on the right‑most incision; the two central slits remain untouched.

With the first stitch down, attention shifts to advancing closure superiorly. In 45–59 s, the driver is superior‑right of the slit with the needle prepared for a new pass proximal to the initial knot; the left hand manages the free end and stabilizes the tissue. Symmetric far‑to‑near bites are being taken, with tension applied to begin bringing the edges together, but a second knot is not yet visible; one completed stitch remains. This preparatory phase continues in 60–74 s: the right hand again loads the needle at approximately the proximal third and aligns it for another bite on the right wound edge, while the left hand provides counter‑tension and slight eversion with fingers. This frameset shows initiation of the next stitch without completion; still only the initial completed stitch is present.

The next milestone comes at 75–89 s, where the operator places and ties a stitch at the mid‑lower third of the same incision, using instrument ties and then scissors for trimming. Even here, the count of completed stitches by the end is noted as a single completed interrupted stitch—consistent with the idea that the prior bite setups were preparatory and that trimming occurred on the first stitch. Scissors appear from above during finishing, then withdraw, and only one tied stitch is counted on the line.

In 90–104 s, the rightmost line shows one small, trimmed knot mid‑incision. Both hands return to prepare the next pass: the left hand now holds the needle driver while the right hand uses forceps to lift and evert the right wound edge. The needle is again grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin, and aligned to enter the right wound edge for a standard forehand right‑to‑left pass. No tying occurs in these frames; the count remains one completed stitch.

From 105–119 s, the same incision is worked continuously. The right hand maintains the needle holder to perform instrument ties while the left hand manages the free end and steadies the knot site. This sequence shows the tightening and tying of a previously placed stitch on the right‑side incision; nevertheless, the visible completed count reported here remains at one, suggesting the throws are being seated but not fully set or counted as a second finished knot within these frames.

In 120–134 s, a single completed stitch remains visible, and a new bite is started just above it. The left hand again loads the needle at the proximal third, aims perpendicular to the right wound edge, and drives across to the left. The right hand intermittently uses forceps for edge control and then tensions the strands to snug the throw. A second knot is not yet visible in these frames.

Soon after, in 135–149 s, two completed stitches are clearly visible at the mid‑to‑lower third of the rightmost slit. The right hand predominates with the needle driver, and the left hand alternates between forceps and fingers to stabilize and occasionally retract the pad corner. The needle is loaded for another pass near the superior portion, but no further penetration occurs in this slice; the count remains two completed stitches. In 150–164 s, the operator continues to secure a recently placed stitch with additional throws using the driver to manipulate the suture; two completed interrupted stitches remain visible, indicating that the focus is on reinforcing existing knots without adding a third quite yet.

Preparation for the third stitch at the superior aspect becomes more deliberate in 165–179 s: both hands enter from the upper‑right, with the left hand holding the needle driver and the right hand everting the right wound edge with forceps. The needle is grasped on its proximal third to midpoint and oriented almost perpendicular to the skin as it is positioned to begin the next bite just below the existing sutures, but again, no new completed knot is present; two tied stitches are visible on the line. In 180–194 s, the third stitch is actively in progress: the needle driver holds the needle near the right edge, the left hand with forceps stabilizes, and knot throws are formed around a new stitch adjacent to two prior stitches. Although throws are tightened, the count remains two completed stitches here, with a third in progress but not yet secured.

This theme continues in 195–209 s: two completed sutures are present while the operator positions and advances a bite at the superior end with the needle driven perpendicular to the right wound edge. The left hand elevates the dermal edge; the right hand alternates between driving and pulling suture. No tying is finished in this window. By 210–224 s, the attention is concentrated at the top of the incision, with the needle regripped slightly while preparing or tightening a knot; the left hand intermittently manages the tail. Two completed sutures remain visible; a third is being tied but not fully finished or cut here.

The third completed stitch is confirmed in 225–239 s. The left hand holds the needle driver over the incision while the right hand with forceps presents the near/right edge for entry. The needle passes across the incision; the edges approximate without significant gapping. Tying follows, and by the end of this sequence, three completed interrupted sutures are visible along the rightmost line. Afterward, in 240–254 s, the operator focuses on tightening and trimming the existing sutures without taking new bites. The right hand works lateral to the wound to dress the line, and the left hand stabilizes the pad and edges. The count remains three completed stitches.

With the mid‑to‑upper segment now populated, the next bite begins immediately below or just superior to the existing cluster. In 255–269 s, the left hand brings the needle driver in from the upper‑left/center, while the right hand stabilizes the near/right edge with Adson forceps. The needle is positioned roughly perpendicular to the skin, and a right‑to‑left pass is initiated. No knot is tied in this segment; three completed simple interrupted sutures remain. The stitch that brings the total to four is placed and tied in 270–284 s: the operator works at the superior end of the right incision, with the right hand on the driver, the left hand alternating between forceps and tail control. A new stitch is placed with gentle eversion and then tied with instrument ties. By the end of this sequence, four completed interrupted sutures are visible along the line.

Immediately afterward, 285–299 s and 300–314 s show the right hand using the driver for instrument ties with the needle often parked on the strand. The left hand intermittently manages tissue with forceps or provides counter‑traction with fingers. In these intervals, the description notes three completed sutures visible with a fourth in progress and being tied; given that just prior frames counted four completed, this likely reflects transient visualization differences or knot finalization status rather than an actual loss of a stitch. Importantly, the work remains confined to the same rightmost incision, and the operator continues forming throws at the mid‑to‑upper segment.

By 315–329 s, four completed sutures are again consistently visible, and the operator is finishing a knot and trimming tails along the line. The right hand manipulates the suture and scissors just lateral/superior to the wound, while the left hand is less involved. Trimming and dressing continue with the instruments approaching from the right/upper‑right and moving along the line. Next, in 330–344 s, the left hand holds the needle driver with a reloaded needle, and the right hand uses tissue forceps to gently evert the right wound edge at the lower third, positioning to begin another bite at the inferior end. The needle is grasped two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin. However, no passage is completed within these frames, and four completed stitches remain visible.

In 345–359 s, the driver is again in the right hand, angled to the upper portion of the slit. The left hand alternates between forceps and fingers to evert and manage the suture, and for a moment rotates the pad to improve ergonomics, then returns to position. The needle is oriented perpendicular and aimed to pass a new bite at the superior end. The line already holds four completed simple interrupted sutures; no new knot is finished in this window. The same plan carries into 360–374 s: four completed sutures are present while the right hand holds the needle holder over the upper third to prepare yet another bite, and the left hand briefly everts and stabilizes the near edge. The suture is drawn across the gap and prepared for tying, but the stitch is not taken to completion here.

From 375–389 s, instead of adding a fifth suture, the operator tightens and trims the most recent stitch material without driving the needle through tissue. Only the right‑side wound edges are manipulated to snug previously placed stitches; the dominant hand alternates between pulling the strand and trimming with scissors lateral to the incision. After cutting, the line remains unchanged—the four completed stitches stay in place. Finally, in 390–398 s, the field is static with no hands or instruments. The rightmost vertical incision shows a series of evenly spaced interrupted sutures approximating the wound; four completed sutures are visible, tails lying to the right. The two central slits remain untouched throughout.

Hand position evolution and technique consistency are clear across the case. The operator consistently works from the right side of the rightmost incision, repeatedly initiating bites on the near/right wound edge and sweeping the needle right‑to‑left along a perpendicular trajectory. Needle loading remains standard—held at the proximal third to mid‑body, with the jaws perpendicular to the curve. Forceps are used intermittently to stabilize and evert the right wound edge, particularly at the moment of needle entry; at other times, the assistant hand provides counter‑tension with fingers alone. During tying, the needle is often “parked” on the strand, and the driver is used to execute instrument ties, alternating direction and maintaining low, flat throws. When trimming, scissors approach from the right or upper‑right, crossing above the wound, while the other hand maintains tension on the tails to ensure precise, short cuts that do not compromise the knots. Spatially, the driver tends to hover superior‑right to the wound during passes and knot seating, while the assisting hand operates inferior‑right or medial to the wound to stabilize the pad and tissue. The pad is occasionally rotated to bring the target area into a more ergonomic orientation for perpendicular needle entry, but the active wound does not change.

The suture progression follows a logical midline start and superior advancement, with occasional planning for an inferior bite that is not completed within the captured frames. Counting the stitches over time:
- Start (0–29 s): 0 completed stitches; first pass initiated.
- 30–44 s: 1 completed stitch tied at mid‑incision.
- 45–134 s: Preparations and tying maneuvers for the next stitch; the visible completed count remains 1 through 120–134 s.
- 135–164 s: 2 completed stitches now visible in the mid‑to‑lower third; additional throws added without increasing the count.
- 165–224 s: A third stitch is positioned and tied in progress at the superior end, but within these intervals it is not finalized; 2 completed remain visible.
- 225–239 s: The third stitch is tied and counted; 3 completed sutures now visible.
- 240–269 s: Dressing and initiation of another bite; count remains 3.
- 270–284 s: A new stitch is placed at the top and tied; 4 completed sutures visible.
- 285–314 s: Tying and finishing maneuvers continue; descriptions momentarily note 3 completed with a fourth in progress, likely due to visualization or not yet counting an incompletely dressed knot. Work remains on the same line.
- 315–374 s: Four completed sutures are consistently visible while the operator prepares an additional bite superiorly and briefly at the inferior end but does not finalize another stitch.
- 375–389 s: Tightening and trimming only; no new stitch added; 4 completed sutures remain.
- 390–398 s: Static final view with 4 completed sutures.

Final verification and outcome:
- The last frames (390–398 s) clearly show exactly four completed simple interrupted sutures approximating the rightmost vertical incision, with tails lying to the right. No additional throws or new bites are added after this point. The procedure resulted in 4 completed sutures.
- The wound edges are uniformly approximated with slight eversion where forceps were used. Knots and tails are consistently lateral to the right of the incision, reflecting the operator’s approach from the near/right side throughout.
- Although there are moments where a new bite is being prepared at the superior or inferior end, those steps are not carried through to completion within the recorded intervals beyond the four already in place. Occasional minor inconsistencies in intermediate counts correspond to transitional tying phases or camera angle changes; subsequent frames confirm stable visibility of four completed stitches.

In summary, the surgeon closes the rightmost vertical slit using simple interrupted sutures. Starting with a midline stitch, they progress superiorly, eventually establishing four evenly spaced knots that coapt the wound edges with slight eversion. The technique remains consistent: perpendicular needle orientation, near‑to‑far, far‑to‑near arcs initiated on the right edge with forceps‑assisted eversion, followed by instrument ties with the needle parked and final trimming from the right. The two central slits are never addressed. The final state of the wound shows four completed sutures maintaining approximation without undue tension, satisfying the closure goals for this practice line.
