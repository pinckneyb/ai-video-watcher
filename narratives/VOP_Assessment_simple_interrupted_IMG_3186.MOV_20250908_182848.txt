Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Final image confirmation: four completed simple interrupted sutures are present on the central incision. The overall flow is deliberate with decent instrument control, appropriate loading of the needle, and tidy housekeeping (tail trimming and knot seating). You demonstrated restraint with tissue handling and kept knots generally flat and lateral.
