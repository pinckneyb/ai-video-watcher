COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the simulator pad lying centered in the field, showing three parallel vertical slits. From the outset, the operator concentrates on the vertical slit located on the right side of the pad. Over the course of the recording the team works this right-side incision in a methodical, sequential manner—placing simple interrupted skin sutures to close the defect—while occasionally pausing or repositioning between passes.

Opening and early survey (0–60 s)
At the start, the rightmost slit is visible but not yet closed. During the very first frames a single gloved right hand appears briefly at the lateral edge of the pad, confirming orientation and palpating the slit margins. No instrument-mediated suturing activity is evident in the earliest seconds; the wound edges remain slightly gaping and the operator appears to be preparing the field. At several short intervals in the first minute the central incision and other slits receive attention by touch only (finger pads gently approximating edges), but no needle or instrument is brought to the right-sided slit yet. These brief handling steps likely represent assessment and positioning rather than active needle passage.

Initial needle work and establishing technique (60–180 s)
Shortly after the preliminary survey, instrumented work appears consistently on the right slit. Both hands enter the field and establish the familiar working geometry: the dominant hand controls a needle driver while the nondominant hand holds fine toothed forceps (Adson-style) to present, elevate and stabilize the near wound edge. The needle driver typically approaches from an upper/medial direction while the forceps come from lateral/inferior positions; tips remain closely opposed over the wound (often within 1–3 cm), allowing controlled perpendicular needle entry. The curved, swaged needle is grasped in the needle driver at or near the mid-shaft (sometimes closer to the swage), giving the operator fine control of needle rotation and arc. The bite strategy is consistent with epidermal–dermal edge approximation: shallow to full-thickness skin bites taken across opposing edges with slight eversion at the stitch points.

Needle passes are conducted in a sequential fashion along the length of the slit, with the operator working from one end toward the other. Instrument convergence and crossing is used repeatedly: the forceps tent the near edge, exposing a small bite area; the driver rotates the needle through the opposite edge; the suture is then drawn through and organized for knotting. On several occasions during this phase scissors or a second small instrument briefly enter the field, then are removed—consistent with handling suture tails or trimming. Movement is controlled and economical, and tissue handling is atraumatic; the synthetic dermis is engaged gently and bites are uniform in depth.

Mid-procedure consolidation and repeated passes (180–300 s)
Throughout the middle portion of the recording, the right-sided incision is steadily progressed. The operator follows a repeating cycle: present edge with forceps, drive curved needle with the driver from near-side to far-side, draw suture through, and prepare/complete knotting. Hands remain close together and maintain consistent orientation—needle driver commonly coming from superior or upper-left directions and forceps from more lateral or lower-right vectors. The needle is often held about two-thirds from the tip or at midshaft, allowing a controlled arc and perpendicular entry relative to the wound edge.

Suture placement remains interrupted/simple in character; each pass is isolated, placed adjacent to prior stitches to approximate the wound incrementally. There are repeated confirmations of good apposition and slight eversion at each stitch, suggesting deliberate technique to promote edge alignment. When sutures are completed the operator manipulates and ties the knots with the driver and forceps—suture tails are organized and occasionally trimmed with scissors introduced briefly. Even when multiple stitches are already present along the mid and distal portion of the slit, the team continues adding additional bites progressively toward the superior or proximal gap until the entire defect is spanned.

Brief lapses and non‑instrumented intervals (300–360 s)
Interspersed with periods of active suturing are short intervals where no hands or instruments are visible at the immediate wound site. During these moments the operator either repositions, surveys prior knots, or manipulates suture tails away from the field. There are also frames where only finger pads (no instruments) are observed approximating other incisions or briefly flattening the pad—these are primarily assessment maneuvers and do not change the suturing strategy on the right slit. The sporadic lack of visible instruments does not reflect discontinuity in the plan; rather, it indicates brief pauses between passes, instrument changes, and knot management.

Refining bites and tying technique (360–420 s)
Following these short pauses, the operator resumes instrumented work and continues to refine the rows of interrupted stitches. Needle handling technique is consistent: the curved needle is rotated in a controlled arc, usually grasped at a point permitting secure purchase and easy maneuvering. The forceps present the edge with a small amount of eversion so that the epidermal margins will evert when approximated, a common intent when placing simple interrupted skin sutures. Hands stay close over the wound; the needle driver and forceps converge with tips often separated by only a few millimeters at the point of passage to maximize control of bite depth and trajectory.

Throughout this phase the operator places stitches sequentially adjacent to pre-existing ones, pulling suture tails through and arranging loops in preparation for instrument ties. Knot-tying is performed with the needle driver and forceps in coordinated tandem—one instrument to tension and hold, the other to create throws or cut tails—until each stitch is secured. The handedness remains consistent with the needle driver in the dominant hand and the tissue-holding forceps in the nondominant.

Final passes and completion (420–498 s)
In the final minutes the superior gap receives focused attention. The operator converges instruments at the topmost portion of the slit and places the last required interrupted stitch(es) to fully approximate the wound edges. Needle passes are executed with the same mid-shaft grasp and rotational motion; the opposing forceps again tent and present the near edge. Each final pass is followed by knot formation, suture tightening, and tail management. Scissors or a small cutting instrument appears briefly in several frames to trim excess suture once knots are secured.

By the end of the recording the entire right-side incision is spanned by a row of evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures. Wound edges are approximated with consistent eversion at each stitch site, and there is no residual gross gaping along the length of the slit. The suture line sits slightly everted at points of entry and exit—typical of well-tensioned skin sutures intended to promote epidermal alignment. Instrument positions are relaxed and withdrawn from the immediate field after knot trimming and final inspection.

Technique characteristics and consistency
Across the whole procedure the operator maintains a remarkably consistent suturing approach. The chosen technique is simple interrupted skin suturing with a curved swaged needle, used with a needle driver and toothed forceps. Needle grips are generally at the mid‑shaft or slightly proximal, promoting controlled curvature and predictable tissue path. Bite depth is reproducible—superficial to full-thickness of the skin analog—aimed at precise edge apposition rather than deep layer approximation. Edges are presented with the forceps to allow perpendicular entry and a uniform purchase through the dermal layer.

Hand and instrument geometry remain constant throughout: the dominant hand repeatedly supplies the needle-driving motion from a superior/medial vector while the nondominant hand provides lateral stabilization and suture management. Instruments cross lightly over the incision when necessary and their tips remain closely opposed in the operative window. Knot-tying employs coordinated driver/forceps manipulation with intermittent use of scissors for tail trimming. When instruments are not visible, finger pads are sometimes used to flatten or reposition the model, but instrumented suturing activity resumes consistently on the same right-sided slit when needle passes are required.

Noted limitations and intermittent observations
There are intermittent frames in which instruments or needle passes are not visible, and a few segments where attention appears to be momentarily directed toward the central incision or where fingers alone approximate other slits. Those brief episodes create a minor observational gap but do not interrupt the overall workflow focused on the right slit. Occasionally, small parts of needle passage are partially obscured by instruments—typical in close-up suturing work—but the overall sequence of presenting, passing, drawing, tying, and trimming is continually observable and recurrent.

Final condition of the closure
At the conclusion the right-sided linear wound is closed with a continuous pattern of simple interrupted stitches placed sequentially along its length. The closure demonstrates good edge apposition with slight eversion at suture points, uniform spacing, and secure knots with trimmed tails. The tissue is handled atraumatically throughout; the synthetic skin shows minimal puckering beyond the immediate stitch sites. Instruments are withdrawn and the final inspection confirms a neat, watertight-appearing approximation appropriate for a superficial skin closure on a practice pad.

Overall, the recording documents a complete, consistent execution of interrupted skin suturing on the right vertical incision: methodical edge presentation, controlled curved-needle passes, deliberate knot formation and tail management, and progressive shortening of the open defect until the entire slit is closed and inspected.
