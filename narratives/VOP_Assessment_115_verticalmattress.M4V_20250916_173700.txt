Pattern: Vertical Mattress

Summative assessment:
There are 7 completed sutures. The closure shows disciplined hand positioning, perpendicular needle presentation, light forceps use, and consistent spacing. Start and finish ties are square and well seated, and the line is set neatly with controlled global tensioning. However, the essential mechanics of a vertical mattress are not demonstrated. Each stitch must have a deep far-far component to offload tension and a superficial near-near component to evert the epidermis; that layered architecture is absent, leaving most of the load at the skin and only modest eversion. To meet vertical mattress standards, execute each stitch as a two-depth sequence with symmetric, perpendicular bites (far ~5–8 mm from the edge, near ~2–3 mm), maintain equal depths across the wound, and set tension so the deep pass carries the load while the near pass gently everts. Maintain the current efficiency and gentle handling, but correct the pass geometry to achieve durable, tension-sharing eversion.
