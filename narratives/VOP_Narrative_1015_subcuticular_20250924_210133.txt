COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single, continuous repair of the vertical midline incision located in the central region of the practice skin pad. From the opening frames through the conclusion, the operators focus their attention on this central vertical slit — working sequentially along its length to approximate the synthetic dermal edges with multiple interrupted stitches, refine tissue eversion, and complete knot tying and trimming. A few brief frames reference neighboring practice slits, but the narrative below describes the consistent, repeated actions taken on the central midline wound throughout the recording.

Initial approach and early stitches (0–90 s)
The team establishes a classic two‑handed, instrument‑assisted technique from the outset. One hand assumes the role of needle control with a ring‑handled driver or locking needle holder; the contralateral hand uses fine toothed forceps (Adson‑style) to present, tent, and evert the epidermal edges. A curved surgical needle, attached to a monofilament suture, is repeatedly grasped in the driver roughly at the mid‑shaft to distal third rather than at the swage or extreme tip. This mid‑shaft purchase is used throughout to allow controlled rotation and to follow the needle curvature through the tissue.

Needle passes are executed as shallow, controlled arcs that engage the superficial dermal analogue of the pad. The forceps tents and slightly everts the near edge while the driver advances the needle from the opposite side; the convex face of the needle is typically oriented upward as it traverses the tissue. Hands sit close to the wound (commonly within 1–4 cm of the margins), flanking the incision so the driver approaches laterally and the forceps medially. Movements are coordinated — driver pierces → forceps repositions/tents → driver advances — producing precise bites through the epidermal/dermal layers without deep tissue engagement. Early actions show active needle passage, suture pull‑through, and preparation for knot formation on each completed bite.

Development of pattern and technique consolidation (90–180 s)
As the sequence progresses, interrupted sutures are placed in a sequential fashion along the midline. The same core technique — one instrument driving the curved needle through one edge and the other instrument controlling the opposing edge — remains constant, but there is refinement in hand choreography and tissue handling. Operators increasingly emphasize slight eversion of the epidermal rims during needle exit and suture tightening to ensure edge apposition that will heal with minimal inversion. Grasp points on the needle remain predominantly mid‑shaft, permitting predictable arcs and consistent bite depths. The two hands frequently cross over the incision in a cross‑grip pattern: the driver approaches from a lower‑left trajectory while the forceps approaches from upper‑right (or vice versa), providing opposing trajectories that allow the needle to pass cleanly through the tissue.

Instrumentation and hand roles are largely consistent: the dominant hand manipulates the needle with the needle driver, the nondominant hand manages tissue with forceps and controls suture tails with ring clamps or hemostats as needed. When a bite is completed, the needle and suture are drawn through, the loop organized, and the instruments coordinate to form secure knot throws. At times a third instrument (scissors or an extra hemostat) is used transiently to manage the free tail or to trim after tying. Throughout, the operators avoid excessive traction, preventing tearing of the synthetic dermis.

Mid‑procedure refinement and central segment work (180–260 s)
The work concentrates on the central portion of the midline incision. Bites remain superficial to mid‑dermal, consistent with a standard epidermal/dermal interrupted technique on this practice model. The operator repeatedly uses forceps to lift and stabilize one edge while the needle is passed through the opposite margin; suture tails are pulled through and positioned to the lateral aspect of the wound between passes. Instrument distances remain compact (typically 1–5 cm separation), maintaining a small, controlled working zone directly over the defect.

Needle handling nuances become more apparent: some passes are made with the needle held closer to the needle body to allow robust rotational control; in other frames the grasp shifts slightly toward the distal shaft for fine directional adjustments. The curvature of the needle is used fully — passes are performed through controlled arcs rather than blunt plunges — producing clean transfixing bites. The operators maintain atraumatic manipulation (fine toothed pickups) to avoid crushing the synthetic tissue, and they employ a consistent sequence: present edge with forceps, pass needle through opposing edge, draw suture and prepare for knot tying.

Completion of central passes, knot formation, and suture management (260–320 s)
After sequential placement along the central portion, attention turns to finishing individual interrupted stitches. Knot formation becomes more visible: the needle driver and forceps exchange roles briefly to perform successive throws, tension knots, and position suture tails. Throughout these maneuvers the tissue is held with light counter‑traction so that each knot approximates and slightly everts the epidermal edges, preventing inversion. The left/right hands interchangeably assume needle‑holding and tissue‑stabilizing roles, allowing the surgeon to complete secure throws without losing control of tissue orientation.

Suture tails are managed carefully: one hand keeps the standing limb under control while the other executes throws with the driver; additional hemostats or scissors appear momentarily for suture control and trimming. There is deliberate attention to trimming close to knots to produce a tidy line of interrupted closures with minimal excess filament.

Final passes, superior segment work, and closure refinement (320–348 s)
Work shifts toward the superior end of the incision where remaining bites are completed and knots finalized. The same pattern persists — curved needle, mid‑shaft grasp, forceps-guided tissue presentation — but the team’s motions show a slight acceleration and economy of movement as the closure nears completion. The superior segment shows preplaced interrupted knots along most of the incision, with the current activity being tensioning, dressing, and trimming of the last suture.

Instrument orientation tightens: the forceps anchor the epidermal flaps medially while the driver tensions and completes the final throws laterally. After tying, the driver performs the snips or the assistant holds scissors to trim the suture tail. The wound edges along the entire midline are closely apposed and uniformly slightly everted — the overall cosmetic line consistent with proper epidermal alignment on the synthetic model. No gross tearing or excessive puckering is observed; the closure appears to be executed with atraumatic technique and consistent bite depth.

Technique evolution and consistency
Across the entire case the suturing approach remains a standard interrupted technique with two‑handed instrument control. There is strong consistency in fundamental elements: use of a curved needle, mid‑shaft grasp for optimal rotational control, and the employment of fine forceps to present and evert wound edges. The operators alternate which hand holds the needle driver depending on approach angle and the segment of the incision being addressed, but the roles remain familiar and complementary. Movements remain economical and coordinated; instruments cross over the incision in predictable cross‑grip patterns to achieve controlled needle trajectories.

Slight variations occur — subtle shifts of the needle grasp point for directional control, alternating dominance of the left or right hand as the team moves cranially along the wound, and occasional use of an ancillary hemostat or scissors to manage suture tails — yet none of these adjustments alter the core technique or compromise the integrity of the closure. Tissue handling becomes progressively more refined as the operators settle into a rhythm: edges are consistently approximated with minimal tension and maintained in slight eversion at knot tying.

Spatial relationships and hand dynamics
Throughout, hands remain close to the incision, preserving fine motor control. The needle driver and forceps frequently occupy opposing but adjacent positions across the wound with rapid, coordinated exchanges as each pass is completed and the next is initiated. Instrument tips converge within a small working envelope directly over the midline; when tying, hands cross or overlay briefly to tension and throw knots, then separate to allow trimming. Suture tails are managed laterally to avoid entanglement with subsequent passes. The coordinated interplay of left/right hands produces a steady progression from one interrupted stitch to the next along the vertical axis.

Final state of the closure
By the final frames the entire midline incision is uniformly approximated with a continuous row of interrupted sutures, each knot snugged to produce consistent edge apposition and slight eversion. The suture tails lie neatly lateral to the wound and are trimmed as needed. No fresh needle passes are visible at the end; the last actions consist of final knot management and organization of the remaining suture limbs. Overall, the closure demonstrates controlled needle handling, atraumatic tissue manipulation, and a methodical sequential interrupted pattern that restores the synthetic dermal edges into close, cosmetically favorable alignment.
