COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with setup and orientation. The instruments are laid out, the synthetic skin pad is centered, and the suture and curved needle sit to the left. The operator removes an ID card from the lower field, then each hand takes its role: the left hand picks up the needle driver and loads the curved needle on its body, oriented for a perpendicular approach to the pad; the right hand takes tissue forceps and stabilizes the surface at the intended entry site. No penetration is completed yet as the operator positions for the first bite.

The first passes begin along the right wound edge. With the left hand controlling the needle driver and the right hand everting the edge with forceps, the needle is driven perpendicular to the skin, then the driver releases and regrips on the far side of the arc to complete the passage. The suture is drawn through smoothly with slack management, the forceps maintaining gentle control at the dermal edge. This establishes the working rhythm: driver advances and regrips; forceps stabilize, present tissue, and guide exit.

A brief horizontal mattress sequence follows. The right hand now holds the needle holder and drives the needle, while the left hand assists with forceps to lift and align the edge. After passage, the right hand parks the holder so the opposite hand can pull the suture through. The horizontal bridge forms between marked points with edges approximated without excessive traction, illustrating controlled alternating dominance without crossing hands.

The operator then returns to a series of perpendicular, standard bites guided by premarked points. With the left hand on the needle driver and the right hand on forceps, the needle is loaded at the proximal third, driven with wrist rotation, and regrasped as needed to follow its curvature. The right hand often receives the needle tip with forceps to complete each pass before returning it to the driver for reloading. The suture is kept lateral and untangled, slack moved to the right side, and the board is subtly repositioned to maintain good needle trajectory.

There is a short interlude to trim a suture end and optimize needle orientation. The right hand picks up scissors to cut near a prior stitch on the lower-left, sets them aside, and then uses forceps to rotate the needle in the left-hand driver for a clean perpendicular approach toward the midline. No tissue penetration occurs during the cutting/repositioning; the field remains organized and the needle is reloaded accurately.

At midline, the right hand briefly takes the driver to refine the grasp and angle, while the left-hand forceps lift the near edge for eversion. The driver sets the needle nearly perpendicular, completes the withdrawal of a prior pass, and parks the needle while the operator transitions into knot tying. Instrument ties are performed: the driver forms loops, the opposite hand presents and passes the short end, and throws are seated directly over the incision with even, downward tension. The knot is squared by alternating directions, keeping the approximation centered without gapping.

With the central stitch secured, the operator continues preparing and placing more simple interrupted bites. The left-hand driver stays centered; the right hand uses forceps to stabilize target points and manage the suture line. Needle grasp is refined on the body one-third from the swage, orientation vertical over the target marks, and regrips are performed within the driver to maintain a smooth, curved entry. Slack from prior passes is controlled to avoid fouling the field as the next bite is prepared—no knot tying yet, just setup and suture management.

The pace then alternates between active passes and tying sequences, showing a consistent, economical cadence. On one sequence, the right hand becomes the working driver to take a bite on the left incision margin while the left hand provides countertraction with forceps, slightly everting the edge. The needle is driven along its arc, regrasped, and extracted; the stitch is then secured with instrument ties using one or two drivers. Throws are alternated to square the knot and are pulled along the axis of the wound so the knot lays flat and centered. Scissors appear intermittently to trim tails after knots are seated, then are parked clear of the field.

In the mid-procedure segments, this pattern repeats: passes through marked, symmetric bite points with careful edge handling, followed by deliberate knot tying. At times the needle remains clamped in a driver during tying, serving as a post, and at other times it is parked off to the side while both hands use drivers for a two-instrument tie. The operator keeps suture limbs separated, manages slack off to the right, and applies balanced traction from both sides to seat each knot without lateral displacement. Forceps occasionally touch down near the stitch to keep the knot from twisting the tissue, but avoid crushing the dermal edge.

As the closure progresses toward the superior end of the incision, the operator refines needle loading and orientation without penetrating—forceps adjust the needle on the driver until it is perfectly perpendicular to the target edge. The nondominant hand tents the entry site and gently aligns the edge; the dominant hand positions the tip just at the epidermal margin. Contralateral bites are set up with the driver just medial to the wound edge and the forceps slightly lateral, maintaining a clear needle path and preventing instrument collision. Where appropriate, ties are performed immediately after a pass; elsewhere, the needle is reloaded to take the opposing bite before the knot is laid.

Late in the sequence, multiple stitches are already in place and the central wound is well approximated. Several tying sequences dominate these frames: first with one driver and forceps, then with two drivers crossing centrally during the throws. The operator keeps the hands symmetric over the wound, alternates throw directions for a secure square knot, and cinches down vertically so the knot seats directly on the incision line. At one point a small paper tag in the field is cleared away before tying continues. Throughout, the scissors remain parked unless needed to cut a tail, and the suture ends are directed along the wound’s long axis during tightening.

The video closes with a brief pause in action. The left hand holds the needle driver with the curved needle properly grasped near its proximal-to-mid third, angled obliquely toward the pad with the concavity facing the operator. The right hand hovers near the instruments but does not engage. No tissue penetration or tying occurs in these final frames; the suture lies untensioned, draped cleanly. The operator is poised at the left incision margin, ready for the next controlled, perpendicular bite—an endpoint that underscores the measured, methodical rhythm established throughout the procedure: orient, evert, drive, regrasp, pull through, manage slack, and secure with deliberate, centered knots.
