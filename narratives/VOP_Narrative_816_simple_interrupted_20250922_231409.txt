COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The field is a silicone suture pad with three parallel vertical practice incisions. From the outset, the operator dedicates the work to closing the central midline cut and returns to it consistently across the sequence, building a clean series of individual, instrument-tied stitches from the middle of the line upward to its superior end. At a few isolated moments, the hands touch a lateral slit to rehearse a pass or demonstrate needle control, but these brief interludes do not alter the primary closure: the central midline wound is the one being sutured to completion.

The procedure opens with careful setup at the upper third of the central incision. The left hand brings in a needle holder from the left/top-left and the right hand, with fine forceps, helps orient the curved needle for a forehand drive. The needle is adjusted on its body—held near the proximal third to mid-body—so its arc will present perpendicular to the skin. The forceps tent the near skin edge lightly to present a target but no penetration is made yet; this is pure orientation and loading, with the instruments opposed across the incision and converging at the intended entry point.

Immediately thereafter, the operator secures an initial stitch in the middle of the central incision. The left hand steadies a needle holder vertically over the wound to serve as the post for instrument ties while the right hand manipulates the free limb, looping it around the driver and delivering the tail through the loop to form successive throws. The needle is kept safely parked away from the wound to avoid catching tissue during tying. Multiple alternating throws are cinched directly over the incision midline. This first knot consolidates the prior pass and establishes the rhythm for how subsequent stitches will be secured.

A side-to-side bite across the central slit is then completed and tied. The right hand continues to hold the needle driver while the left alternates between briefly using Adson forceps to adjust the needle orientation and managing the suture tail. The bite traverses the midline—far-to-near—and, once the suture is through, the forceps are set down so the hands can form instrument ties. The driver remains over the center/right of the wound as the free end is crossed anteriorly to fashion the throws, which are seated over the midline target points. Subsequent frames show the driver working just left/superior to the incision center while the right hand pulls the opposite limb laterally, creating a clear V-angle across the incision. Alternating throws are laid down to square the knot and the wound edges at that level are coapted without gapping.

With the knot secured, the operator trims the tails. The needle holder in the left hand stabilizes just over the knot while the right hand brings in suture scissors from the right. The blades are aligned parallel to the slit, and the tips are advanced close to the knot to cut the strands short without compromising security. The instruments are coordinated to avoid crossing and then withdrawn to the right, leaving the wound undisturbed with short, neat tails.

There follows a brief, self-contained demonstration on the leftmost vertical slit: the left hand advances the needle perpendicular to the skin and the right-hand forceps escort the tip across the wound. A transverse bridge is created, and the suture is drawn through. Eversion is minimal and knot tying is not shown at that moment. In the next sequence on that same left slit, another mid-portion bite is taken with forceps-assisted edge control. These brief left-sided maneuvers serve as isolated practice passes; they do not continue into a systematic closure, and the operator promptly returns to the central line.

Back at the central site, the operator completes a knot over the short midline wound. The left hand continues to hold the needle driver immediately above the wound, using the needle as a controlled post to help slide the throws down. The right hand alternates between manipulating the free suture end and, later, bringing in scissors to trim. Throws are advanced methodically to compact the knot stack without twisting, and tails are cut flush with the skin. Throughout this central tying, the needle remains parked and away from the tissue to prevent accidental engagement.

A short interlude on the left incision shows preparatory setup with the right-hand forceps everting the near edge and the needle driver poised to take a bite, but no penetration occurs in that moment. The operator then returns to the central wound to complete another full pass. The left-hand driver advances the needle across the central slit in a smooth arc, and a second instrument captures the tip to complete the pull-through, a two-handed delivery that keeps the bite controlled. Both limbs are now on opposite sides of the wound and slack is progressively drawn out.

There is a counterpoint on the left incision where the operator ties a previously placed stitch without forceps; tension alone is used to approximate the edges. This sequence highlights a deficiency: the absence of forceps-based eversion during tying. Even here, the motion style mirrors the central technique—needle parked, needle holder used as post, throws formed and tightened—though the left slit is not carried forward as the closure of interest.

The narrative then anchors again at the central midline. A stitch at the lowest part of the central knot stack is tightened and finished; the left hand maintains tension on the standing part, and the right-hand scissors come in at a shallow angle to trim tails precisely. With that completed, attention shifts up the midline: the left-hand needle driver returns to the central wound and the right hand alternates between pickups and a second needle holder to tie. The needle is held at the proximal third, perpendicular to the skin, and the driver is used both to retrieve the needle after each pass and to serve as the tying instrument. During the new pass, the right hand controls the free end to prevent slack as the left drives the needle through one edge, across the gap, and out the opposite edge. The edges are approximated by suture traction rather than aggressive forceps manipulation, and tying begins but completes in the next series.

This cadence repeats: knot finalization on the central incision followed by tail trimming with scissors approaching from the right, the blades kept parallel to the wound for control. The operator then loads the needle to the proximal third for the next pass, using light forceps support when needed. In one sequence, the left-hand driver executes the pass while the right hand transitions from forceps to a second needle holder to perform an instrument tie with two drivers. The instruments oppose each other across the wound and a loop is formed centrally; the throws are cinched down under direct vision, seating the knot over the incision. It’s a neat illustration of using two needle holders to tie when the free end is short or when additional control is desirable.

Further along the central line, the left-hand needle holder remains the primary tying instrument while the right hand manages the long suture limb with fingers, forming loops and delivering the tail to the driver. No forceps are used in those frames; the knot is slid down smoothly on the suture, with care to avoid twisting or over-tightening. After securing that stitch, the operator cuts the tails, then immediately reorients the needle for the next pass, sometimes transferring it with forceps before regrasping at the correct proximal third-to-mid-body position. This deliberate needle loading ensures that each subsequent bite will enter perpendicular to the skin for consistent dermal purchase and eversion.

In the upper half of the central wound, the pattern continues: one interrupted stitch is tightened and completed, and the tails are trimmed. The needle is parked above the wound during tying and oriented perpendicular when readied for the next bite. The right hand may briefly stabilize the right wound edge or the suture strand with forceps as the knot seats. Attention then shifts to trimming; scissors cross over the midline to cut close to the knot, after which both instruments drift off to reload outside the pad.

As the operator advances toward the superior end, another pass is taken at the top of the central incision, followed by tying. The right-hand driver guides the needle, and the left hand retrieves the free end to throw instrument ties. The wound edges are gently coapted without excess compression; there is no spreading of the incision edges, just steady traction to snug the stitch. The following sequence shows additional throws being placed; the right hand crosses anterior to the driver to loop the free end, then draws it laterally and inferiorly to tighten while the driver acts as the knot pusher. The suture is kept clear of the field and tensioned methodically to avoid loosening.

Near the superior terminus of the central incision, the left-hand driver holds the needle at mid-body and aligns its axis with the wound while tensioning and tying. No new bites are taken in this part; it is all about completing and securing the last few knots. Scissors then enter from the right to trim a tail while the driver stabilizes directly over the knot—scissor tips parallel to the incision to avoid fraying or leaving long ends. At this stage, the midline incision shows multiple prior stitches with the superior-most segment being secured.

A brief pause follows where hands are off the field; then the right hand reenters with a needle holder above the upper third of the central incision. The left hand assists near the wound apex. The needle is mounted for a right-handed pass but no tissue penetration occurs in these frames—this is simply the transition to the next bite site. This poised positioning maintains continuity of the technique without adding a new stitch just yet.

There is one more short detour to the left-side incision where the needle driver and forceps collaborate to pass a new stitch at the superior third of that lateral wound. The forceps tent the near edge, and the driver maintains near-perpendicular approach. The suture is drawn through but tying is deferred; again, this is a demonstrative interlude, not part of the central closure.

The operator then turns back to the midline at its topmost portion to finish the line. The right hand uses a needle driver to complete the final throws at the apex. The needle, grasped about two-thirds from the tip and oriented perpendicular, is set aside as the driver is used to tie. The left hand, which earlier controlled the superior wound edge with forceps, now helps maintain tension. Instrument ties are thrown deliberately over the midline to secure the culmination of the series. In one set of frames there is a visual suggestion of a continuous span at the apex because the standing part is tensioned along the incision; however, the actions performed are consistent with finishing and securing the end of the most recent interrupted stitch rather than advancing a true continuous run. Per the selected technique, the closure remains a sequence of individual, instrument-tied stitches, not a reclassification to a running pattern.

The final motions show the left hand stabilizing a free strand near the upper knots while the right hand brings scissors across the centerline to cut the tails. The scissor tips are again aligned parallel to the incision, cutting close to the knot with careful control. After trimming, both hands withdraw, leaving a midline incision whose edges are evenly approximated and undisturbed. A visible row of small, evenly spaced knot stacks extends along the central wound from the mid-portion to the superior end. The lateral practice slits remain unclosed; they were briefly engaged only to demonstrate needle handling, edge control, or tying without impacting the primary repair.

Across the entire process, several technical themes remain consistent:

- Needle control and orientation: The needle is almost always grasped at the proximal third to mid-body in the needle holder, providing leverage for a smooth semicircular drive. It is presented perpendicular to the skin surface to take symmetric bites. When used as a post during tying, the needle is kept out of the tissue plane and oriented safely to avoid accidental injury.

- Edge handling and eversion: The operator intermittently uses fine forceps to tent or steady an edge for bite placement, especially at the top of the wound and during certain passes. At times, particularly during tying, forceps are not used; approximation relies on traction on the suture limbs. Where forceps are absent during tying (as highlighted during the left-incision practice), eversion is acceptable but could be improved—this is noted as a minor deficiency relative to ideal teaching technique.

- Tying technique: Instrument ties dominate. The needle holder frequently acts as the post, and the opposite hand delivers the tail through the loop to form alternating throws. In several sequences, a second needle holder is used instead of forceps during tying, allowing a two-instrument tie when the free end is short or when enhanced control is beneficial. Throws are seated squarely with deliberate alternating directions to lock the knot and avoid slippage.

- Spatial relationship and hand choreography: The instruments consistently straddle the midline, working within a few millimeters of the incision. During tying, the right hand often draws the long limb laterally/rightward and then centrally to seat each throw, creating a characteristic V-angle across the wound before cinching. Scissors almost always approach from the patient’s right side with the blades parallel to the wound axis for close trimming. The operator maintains clear lines of motion, avoids crossing instruments during critical steps, and keeps the suture clear of the field to prevent entanglement.

- Progression along the wound: The closure builds from the central portion upward toward the superior end, with a repeating cycle—pass, manage slack, tie, cut, reload. The wound edge alignment is checked visually at each step, and tension is applied just enough to coapt without strangulating the tissue. Preparatory steps for subsequent bites are set up immediately after tail trimming, ensuring a steady, efficient flow.

By the end of the sequence, the central midline incision is closed with a neat series of instrument-tied knots spaced along its length. The edges are brought together smoothly with no obvious gaps or inversion. Tails are uniformly short and trimmed flush, reflecting the scissors’ consistent parallel approach to the knot. The final topmost knot is secured and the instruments withdraw, leaving the central wound fully approximated and stable. The lateral practice incisions, while occasionally used to illustrate technique, do not form part of the completed closure. The procedure, as a whole, demonstrates a methodical, consistent application of the selected suturing technique along one incision, with careful attention to needle handling, economical motion, and clean knot finishing.
