Overview and setting
The procedure documents a focused closure of a single skin wound on a synthetic practice pad. From the opening frames through to the final sequences the surgeon methodically reconstructs the same wound line, working sequentially along its length and adding successive stitches to achieve layered epidermal approximation. The working field is small and contained; the two gloved hands remain in close coordination throughout, the dominant hand carrying a needle driver and the nondominant hand supporting tissue with fine toothed forceps or pick‑ups. Instruments and technique are textbook in appearance: curved, swaged suture needles manipulated with a needle driver, opposing forceps presenting and everting skin edges, and repeated short controlled arcs to place bites near the epidermal margin. Across the recording the operator consistently favors mid‑shaft grasp of the curved needle (sometimes closer to the swage) and perpendicular-to-oblique needle entries designed to obtain superficial-to-mid dermal apposition with slight eversion of the wound edges.

Phase 1 — initial exposure and first passes (0.0s → ~90.0s)
At the outset the wound sits slightly left of the pad’s center — a short vertical linear incision with clean edges and minimal gaping. The early frames show the familiar choreography: one hand (generally the dominant/right) holds a locking needle driver oriented nearly vertical or slightly oblique over the wound, the other (left/non‑dominant) uses fine Adson‑style forceps to grasp and present the near margin. The needle is grasped in the driver approximately at mid‑shaft or near the swage, tip oriented downward toward the tissue. The operator advances the curved needle in a controlled arc, driving it through the epidermis/dermis of one edge while the forceps lifts and everts the opposite edge to present an ideal bite. Bites are placed close to the epidermal margin (a few millimeters from the edge), producing gentle eversion and accurate epidermal alignment when the suture is tensioned.

Throughout these early sequences the operator proceeds sequentially along the wound, placing interrupted stitches in a regular pattern. The hands stay compact — instrument tips typically 1–3 cm apart — and cross over the incision plane in a tightly coordinated fashion. Needle passes are short, controlled rotations through superficial-to-intermediate depth of the simulator skin, with minimal tissue distortion. The surgeon periodically repositions the needle driver grip nearer or farther along the needle shaft to adjust arc control before the next pass. At least one early frame records removal of short suture tails with scissors immediately after knotting, indicating knot security and attention to tidy final contours.

Phase 2 — establishing sequential closure and consistency (90.0s → ~240.0s)
As the procedure moves into mid‑video timing, the pattern becomes routine and structured. The operator continues to place sequential simple interrupted stitches along the same vertical line, working neighboring interspaces between already tied knots. Hand roles remain stable: the dominant hand with the needle driver remains the driver of needle arcs, approaching from above or lateral depending on the bite site, while the nondominant hand reliably functions as tissue presenter and assistant, everting and approximating the near edge and also managing suture slack when needed.

Needle handling reveals consistent technique choices: the instrument grasp is generally at or just proximal to mid‑shaft; passes are made perpendicular-to-oblique relative to the wound to allow the needle’s curvature to follow a smooth arc through skin. The operator repeatedly presents tissue with toothed forceps, tenting the epidermis slightly to permit a superficial-to-mid-dermal purchase without including underlying bulk. When the needle exits the far edge the forceps receive or pull the needle through, and the suture is drawn until margins approximate with slight eversion. Over these frames, the operator displays controlled economy of motion — small, precise strokes rather than large sweeping movements — and keeps hands within a few centimeters of the incision for tactile control.

A handful of frames in this mid‑section show the presence of multiple previously tied interrupted knots lateral or inferior to the immediate working point, confirming that the closure proceeds in a staged, linear manner. The operator occasionally re‑positions the non‑dominant hand to control the free end of the suture or to make a quick cut, but the fundamental exchange — needle through one edge, forceps present opposite edge, pull‑through and tension — remains unchanged.

Phase 3 — advancing along the line, managing curvature and geometry (240.0s → ~420.0s)
As the operator advances, the incision geometry varies between strictly vertical and mildly oblique segments. The surgeon adapts by altering approach angles: for straight vertical bites the driver commonly approaches from a cephalad or lateral vector and advances the needle tip perpendicularly; for oblique or curved portions the driver takes a slightly tangential trajectory so the needle curvature can traverse the dermis comfortably without twisting the tissue. In all cases the grasp on the needle remains at the familiar mid‑shaft or shaft‑proximal region to preserve control of the arc.

Tissue interaction continues to emphasize eversion and precise epidermal alignment. The forceps lift and present the near margin, creating a tent so the needle can capture dermal tissue with a small bite. Bites remain relatively superficial rather than deep muscular or subcutaneous purchases, consistent with cutaneous interrupted technique on a practice pad. The hands remain in close proximity and often cross above the incision to exchange the needle between driver and forceps or to change orientation. Occasional frames show a greater degree of crossing as the operator negotiates constrained working angles, but the underlying cooperation between driver and forceps remains constant.

There are intermittent observations that merit noting: a few segments show suturing activity on slightly different wound contours (short curved incisions, oblique cuts) located left or right in the field. These represent the same continuity of technique applied to geometrically different segments of the same closure line, and not a change in the operative focus. In a small number of brief frames the operator appears to manipulate a continuous running suture strand or to work one-handed while approaching the wound, but these are transient and do not interrupt the overall sequential interrupted strategy. At one point scissors are used to trim suture tails after knotting, again reinforcing a consistent approach to finish each stitch tidily.

Phase 4 — completing proximal segments and handling more complex curvature (420.0s → ~600.0s)
In later frames the operator works on proximal segments that lie on curved or oblique portions of the line. Here, orientation adjustments become more pronounced: the needle driver sometimes approaches from lateral‑to‑medial or cephalad‑to‑caudad, and the nondominant hand repositions to provide the best line of entry and exit. The needle is still grasped mid‑body in most passes, and tip orientation tends to be tip‑down toward the pad to control depth. Bites remain superficial-to-intermediate dermal depths, producing consistent slight eversion.

Throughout this phase, the operator sustains tight spatial control. Instrument tips remain within a few centimeters of each other and the wound, enabling accurate needle transfer and minimal tissue puckering. The non‑dominant hand serves both as an everter and as suture manager — pulling tails, maintaining slack, and occasionally pinching the skin while the knot is formed. The dominant hand keeps a firm but flexible grip on the needle driver, regripping as needed to maintain the ideal arc and deliver the needle tip with confidence.

There are a few mild inconsistencies noticed in these frames: one short segment displays only a single hand approaching the wound without a clear opposing hand visible for several frames, and another segment briefly shows a preexisting continuous strand in the pad that is manipulated. These momentary departures from the two‑handed interrupted routine are limited in duration and are followed by returns to the standard paired‑instrument technique. Overall the surgeon reestablishes and maintains uniform bite spacing, alignment, and tension as stitches progress.

Phase 5 — finishing passes and final refinements (600.0s → end)
In the final sequences the operator completes the remaining proximal or superior bites and secures the last knots. The pattern remains the same: the driver advances the needle in a compact arc, the forceps present and evert the opposing edge, the suture is pulled until epidermal apposition with slight eversion is achieved, and knots are secured. The operator trims excess suture tails in at least one frame, leaving a tidy line of knots with short residual tails.

Final frames show the wound edges uniformly approximated with a consistent slight eversion that indicates dermal purchase and good epidermal alignment. The stagger and spacing of knots along the line are even; there is no gross wound gaping and no evidence of tissue tearing on the simulated pad. Instrument positions at the close of the procedure are relaxed: the needle driver discontinues active needle arcs, the forceps release tissue, and the hands withdraw from immediate close proximity to the wound.

Technique characteristics and evolution
- Needle grip and manipulation: Throughout the procedure the surgeon consistently grasps the curved swaged needle at the mid‑shaft or slightly proximal to the swage, favoring a grip that balances tip control and arc rotation. Occasional regrips appear when finer control is required near curved segments of the incision. The dominant hand remains the needle‑driving hand throughout; the nondominant hand seldom switches to needle driving for sustained periods.

- Bite depth and orientation: Bites are intentionally shallow to intermediate in the dermal layer of the simulator. The operator deliberately aims for close edge purchase to achieve epidermal alignment with slight natural eversion. The direction of needle entry alternates as needed so that arc curvature is preserved and tissue is not twisted.

- Hand positions and spatial relationships: Hands are closely opposed throughout the closure, usually 1–4 cm apart with instrument tips directly over the wound. The dominant hand generally approaches from above or lateral to the wound while the nondominant hand approaches from the opposing side to present tissue. When working around curves the hands adjust their angles and sometimes cross over, but they retain the same functional roles. The surgeon uses small, coordinated movements rather than large sweeping actions to maintain tactile feedback and precise needle placement.

- Consistency vs. minor deviations: The principal technique — sequential simple interrupted closure with mid‑shaft needle grasp, forceps presentation, and slight eversion — is consistent across the video. Minor deviations (brief running suture visualization, momentary single‑hand approach, variable needle grasp location) occur but do not compromise the overall methodical application of interrupted suturing across the wound line.

Final state of the closure
At the conclusion the entire targeted wound line is closed with evenly spaced, securely tied stitches that approximate the epidermal edges with mild eversion. Knots are seated, suture tails trimmed in select frames, and there is no evident residual gaping of the simulated tissue. The sutures display uniformity in bite placement and tension across the length of the line, indicating deliberate, repeatable technique. Instrument withdrawal at the end is controlled; the hands stop in neutral positions after completing the last knot and the wound appears ready for further dressing or observation if this were a live tissue situation.

Overall impression
The procedure documents a systematic, technically consistent cutaneous closure executed with standard needle‑driver and forceps choreography. The operator maintains a reproducible approach — mid‑shaft needle grips, perpendicular-to-oblique arcs, presentation and eversion with toothed forceps, and careful knot security — across changing incision geometry. Small, momentary departures from the exact pattern are observed but the dominant and persistent method remains a sequential interrupted stitch closure, executed with controlled, economical hand motion and attentive tissue handling to produce a well‑approximated final line.
