Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
The overall motion and flow are deliberate and controlled: passes are executed in a single, smooth arc with consistent perpendicularity, and the suture is managed cleanly to avoid tangling. Hand roles are clear—right hand drives and ties, left hand presents tissue and manages the free limb—producing a steady, low-variance rhythm through pass, manage, tie, and reassess cycles. Knot sequences are squared with alternating tension and the final line shows competent approximation.
