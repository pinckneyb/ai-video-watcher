COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone suture training pad with three vertical incisions visible: a left-sided linear slit near the pad’s left edge, a central midline incision with pre-existing interrupted stitches, and a right-sided slit that remains untouched throughout. The work of closure consistently targets the left vertical slit. Across the sequence the operator employs a simple interrupted technique with instrument ties, taking dermal bites close to the wound margins, everting with Adson forceps, and progressing in a generally inferior-to-superior direction along that left incision. Periodic interludes show instrument handling near the central incision, but no new stitch is placed there, and those moments do not change the progress or count on the left-sided closure.

The opening moments show the setup and the first tissue engagement at the bottom of the left slit. The left hand holds a gold-handled needle driver, and the right hand uses Adson forceps to evert and steady the dermal lip at the inferior end. The curved needle is mounted in the driver about two-thirds from the tip and oriented nearly perpendicular to the synthetic skin. The first bite enters several millimeters from the near edge with a controlled wrist rotation that follows the needle’s curve. During these initial frames, the opposite edge has not yet been taken, and no knotting is attempted; the line remains without any completed sutures.

Work continues on the same left incision as the driver crosses the wound axis toward the far side. The right hand alternates between using forceps and fingers to manage the tissue and suture slack, while the driver maintains a perpendicular presentation. The pass at this stage is still in progress and untied. The edges are opened slightly to expose the dermis, but active eversion of both edges together is not yet achieved. The thread is drawn just far enough to maintain control without tightening.

A brief repositioning occurs as the operator initiates another bite at the superior end of the same left slit. The right hand holds the driver in these moments, and the left hand alternates with forceps and finger control of the left edge. The needle remains grasped two-thirds from the tip and is again delivered perpendicular to the pad surface. This new superior bite is started but not advanced into a completed stitch, and no knotting is seen. This early oscillation between the inferior and superior ends resolves later, and the closure ultimately proceeds in a more linear inferior-to-superior sequence.

The camera then captures a short interlude near the central midline incision. The right hand pulls up on a suture strand, and the left hand parks the driver near the mid-left area of the pad. The needle is mounted in the driver at its mid-to-posterior third and rests to the right of the central line. No new bite is taken on the midline; the existing three interrupted stitches maintain approximation. There is a brief lift of tissue on a lateral slit, but this does not progress the central closure and does not involve a new pass. This interlude is suture management rather than an active stitch on the midline.

The focus returns decisively to the left vertical incision near the lower-left quadrant, still without completed knots. The left hand holds the driver to the left of the slit; the right hand’s forceps evert the near (right) edge while the needle is advanced from the far (left) to the near (right) side. Entry and exit points are a few millimeters from the margin at a consistent depth in the dermis. The suture arcs across the field as the pass is pulled through, and the needle is reloaded. Despite good exposure and bite symmetry in these frames, no knot is tied yet.

At the lower third, the needle takes a symmetrical bite and the first tying maneuvers begin. The right hand keeps the tissue elevated with forceps while the left hand with the driver initiates instrument ties. The driver and forceps cross above the wound axis to throw loops, and the suture tails are managed superiorly and laterally to clear the field. The knot is not fully seated or cut in these frames.

The next sequence at the inferior portion shows the same left slit with the right hand on forceps and the left hand alternating between a driver and brief scissor use while managing the thread. The needle is driven perpendicular from the near to far side and regrasped to complete the pass across. The operator maintains dermal exposure with gentle eversion. Tying is not completed here either. Up to this point, no fully completed stitch is visible on the left slit; the stitches are being placed and prepared for tying.

By the time the field is revisited at the mid portion of the left incision, two completed simple interrupted stitches are now clearly visible inferiorly. These must have been secured during an interval not fully captured in the prior frames. A small gap remains superiorly. The left hand alternates between the needle driver and forceps; the right hand uses Adson forceps to evert edges and occasionally a second driver to pull the needle through. The needle is grasped two-thirds from the tip, set near-perpendicular, and advanced through one edge, then regrasped on the tip to deliver the needle through the opposite edge. The passes are symmetric, and the thread is drawn through, but tying of this next stitch is not yet shown. The count at this stage stands at two completed stitches with a third in progress.

As the next sequence begins, three completed stitches are now present on the left incision, indicating that the previously placed stitch was tied between sequences. The operator continues to work at the superior-left portion of the incision, taking another bite with the driver held in the left hand and Adson forceps in the right. The forceps pick up the dermis to evert each lip, and the needle is delivered across the wound with consistent perpendicular approach and depth just off the wound margin. The strand is pulled through, but no tying is completed in this interval; the count remains three completed stitches with a new pass placed and waiting.

Over the following frames, both instruments are centered over the superior end of the left slit. The needle is grasped at the proximal third with the driver and driven from the near to the far side, with the right-hand forceps elevating and then retrieving the needle. The pass is completed, and the suture is being drawn through. Tying begins at the end of this run—even as two-handed positioning shows a deliberate, methodical setup of the instrument tie—but the knot is not yet seated. The tally remains at three completed sutures.

Attention shifts to securing this top stitch. The left hand performs the instrument ties with the needle driver, managing the long end; the right hand holds the needle with the forceps on its body near the suture junction, then transitions to holding the short strand to help tension the throws. The needle remains outside the tissue during tying. There is minimal additional manipulation of wound edges during this knot seating; the edges approximate well, though the eversion maneuvers during cinching are subdued compared with earlier bite placement. The stitch is coming together, with throws formed, but cutting has not yet occurred. The visual count is still three secured stitches, one in the process of being tied.

The next sequence completes that stitch. The left hand finishes the instrument tie, the knot is advanced down with proper tension to approximate the superior wound edges, and scissors are brought in to trim the tails. Eversion is maintained during the final snugging thanks to the right-hand forceps stabilizing the dermal edge. With the throws set and the tails cut, the new top stitch is now fully secured. This change brings the total on the left incision to four completed simple interrupted sutures, evenly spaced from inferior to superior, with the edges neatly approximated.

Immediately afterward, the view jumps to the central midline incision. The left hand holds a needle driver while the right hand alternates between a green-handled forceps and controlling the suture strands. The curved needle is grasped on its proximal third to midpoint and oriented perpendicular to the pad with the tip directed toward the left midline edge near its upper third. The right-hand forceps stabilize and evert that midline edge while the left hand reloads the needle. No pass is actually made through tissue in these frames. Three completed interrupted sutures are visible in the midline, consistent with earlier observations, and the activity here appears to be instrument repositioning rather than active closure. This interlude does not alter the already completed closure of the left incision, which remains with four secured stitches.

Across the entire sequence, hand positioning and instrument use are consistent and evolve logically as the sutures accumulate. Early on, the left hand almost exclusively wields the needle driver from the left side of the wound, approaching the incision perpendicular to the skin. The right hand, using Adson forceps, is responsible for everting and presenting the tissue for each bite, often lifting the dermis to expose the target plane before the needle penetrates. At several points, the right hand reaches across the wound to retrieve the needle and manage the short suture end, providing counter-traction during instrument ties. During tying, the left hand performs the throws and cinches the knot, while the right hand either steadies the needle or takes control of the short tail to balance tension. Scissors appear briefly when trimming is needed, particularly at the conclusion of the final stitch. The spatial choreography is textbook: triangulation is maintained with the driver lateral-left, forceps on the right, and both instrument tips converging over the incision line; during ties, the tools cross intentionally over the wound to guide the long and short strands in the correct direction and to seat the knot squarely.

Technique remains consistent with a simple interrupted pattern throughout. The needle is typically grasped two-thirds from the tip (occasionally at the proximal third in later frames), and entry is perpendicular with a smooth wrist rotation along the curvature. Bites are taken a few millimeters off the wound margin at symmetric depth, traversing the dermis/subdermis. Eversion is attentive during bite placement—forceps lift each edge to present the dermal plane—and while knot seating occasionally shows less deliberate eversion, the edges nevertheless remain well approximated. Regrasping the needle on exit is common: the driver or the assisting hand captures the needle’s tip/body to bring it through cleanly and prepare for the opposite side. Instrument ties are used to secure each stitch, with throws set deliberately before the suture tails are cut.

There are two brief segments of instrument handling away from the left slit—one around the midline early on and one at the very end. Neither includes a new needle pass through the midline wound; they appear to be strand management or reloading outside the main closure. These moments do not detract from the continuity of the left-sided closure, and they do not change the suture count there.

Progress and the suture count on the left incision can be traced precisely. The line starts with no completed sutures as the first bites are initiated at the inferior end. Early passes are placed without ties; then tying begins at the lower third but is not completed within those frames. Shortly thereafter, two completed stitches are visible on the left incision. Work continues superiorly, and a third stitch appears completed in the next set of frames. The fourth stitch is then placed at the superior end, tied, and the tails cut. The sequence culminates with four completed interrupted sutures on the left incision.

Final verification:
- The last moments that show the left incision clearly (165–179 s) demonstrate the fourth stitch being tied and the tails cut. At this point, there are four completed simple interrupted sutures along that line.
- Subsequent frames (180–184 s) depict instrument positioning near the central midline incision without any tissue passage; three prior stitches are visible on the midline, and no action there affects the left-sided closure.
- Therefore, the procedure results in 4 completed sutures on the left vertical incision. The count progressed from 0, to 2, to 3, and finally to 4 by the end of the sequence.

In summary, the operator closes the left vertical incision with a series of simple interrupted stitches placed from the inferior portion toward the superior end. The technique features perpendicular needle entries, symmetric dermal bites, consistent use of Adson forceps for eversion, and instrument ties to secure each stitch. After a measured sequence of passes and ties, the left incision is left with four evenly spaced, well-approximated sutures. The brief views of the midline incision show no additional suturing and do not alter the final outcome on the left incision. The exact number of completed sutures at the conclusion is four.
