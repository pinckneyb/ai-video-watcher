COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The field opens with a synthetic skin pad bearing three straight, parallel, vertically oriented incisions. From the outset, the work focuses on closing one linear wound and developing a consistent, single interrupted suture line. The operator’s early gestures are exploratory and orienting. A gloved right index finger briefly hovers over the upper half of the right‑side slit, pointing out landmarks and the segment to be closed. The pad is then palpated and gently manipulated between both hands, with fingers bracketing the midline of the pad. The operator alternates between gently stretching the material to open the gap and relaxing pressure to allow the edges to approximate, a tactile warm‑up that clarifies tissue behavior before needle entry. During this period there are several intervals where no instruments are visible and the field is static, offering no new information about technique beyond the fact that the wounds remain undisturbed. At one moment a hand with gauze crosses the superior margin of the frame without contacting the tissue. Through these quiet stretches, the three slits remain evenly spaced and unaltered, and no suture material is present.

A short interlude shows instruments poised over the left‑most slit without a completed bite—likely a brief demonstration of needle approach rather than an attempt to close that wound. The left hand parks a needle holder and the right hand positions pickups near the superior end of the left incision, aligning for a perpendicular entry angle, then withdraws without penetration. This moment underscores the operator’s attention to orthogonal needle approach and proper tissue presentation, but the work itself proceeds on a different line.

Active closure begins in earnest on the vertical wound on the right side of the pad. The technique throughout is consistent with simple interrupted suturing using instrument ties: the needle is grasped in the driver around the proximal third of its curve, kept nearly perpendicular to the skin surface, and advanced with a wrist‑driven arc. Adson‑type forceps in the opposing hand elevate the dermal edge to achieve gentle eversion and present a firm entry point. The first visible stitch near the superior third of this right‑side incision is placed in a controlled pass; the edges are approximated without undue tension, and a compact knot is tied and seated precisely over the wound. A short knot tail is left just lateral to the bite, confirming an instrument‑tied, interrupted closure strategy. The needle is then reloaded, maintaining a perpendicular stance to prepare for the next pass.

As the camera recenters over the pad, the same wound appears central in the frame for some sequences. The operator proceeds with a second pass on this line using the same principles. The right hand holds the driver; the left hand’s forceps lift the near lip of the wound to set bite depth and distance. The needle follows its curvature across, entering at an even distance from the wound edge and emerging at a matched point on the opposite side. The suture is drawn through and managed so that the working strand arcs neatly over the wound with the long end kept to the operator’s right, clearing the field. The knot is formed with instrument throws, squarely seated, and the tails are trimmed with scissors brought in from the opposite side. Each time, the driver and forceps straddle the incision, forming a small working triangle that keeps the instruments parallel and close to the wound, and reduces unnecessary tissue handling.

At times, the operator pauses to tighten, settle, or trim a previously tied knot before proceeding. The driver is used as a knot pusher/tensioner while the forceps control the short end. Where scissors are used, they approach from the side opposite the driver, with the driver stabilizing the knot as the tails are cut close to the knot. In one instance a suture cutter is used in lieu of scissors to trim tails; in another, scissors are visible at the ready as a new knot is secured. These interludes do not change the technique; they complete the prior stitch and clear the field for the next one.

With several stitches now approximating the mid‑portion of the right‑side wound, the operator advances sequentially along the same line. The work progresses toward the upper segment, with stitches added just superior to the previously placed knots. The driver is often held in the left hand, approaching from the patient’s left or superior‑left, and the forceps in the right hand control the near/right wound edge. The operator remains meticulous about the fundamentals:

- Needle handling: The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid‑shaft and maintained perpendicular to the skin surface. The driver releases and regrips as needed to follow the curve, particularly when the arc requires a change in angle to pass through thicker synthetic “dermis” and exit cleanly on the far side. When the needle tip emerges, the opposing hand’s forceps may seize the tip to guide it through without tearing.
- Tissue interaction: Forceps engage the epidermal edge lightly, everting the tissue and stabilizing the entry and exit sites. Bites are symmetrical with respect to depth and distance from the wound edge. The operator avoids crushing tissue, grasping only the dermal edge and releasing as soon as the pass is complete. The preexisting stitches keep the central segment approximated, so minimal traction is needed to seat each new throw.
- Suture management: After each pass, the long strand is drawn laterally (usually to the operator’s right) to clear slack; the short end is controlled near the wound as instrument ties are formed. The path of the thread is kept parallel to the incision to avoid snagging prior knots or crossing the line.
- Instrument triangulation: The driver and forceps oppose each other across the wound, tips converging at the entry point for placement, then separating in opposite directions to tighten throws during knot tying. Throughout, hands stay within a few millimeters of the bite site, maintaining alignment with the wound axis.

Midway through the closure, there is a cycle of steps that repeats with reliable rhythm along the same right‑side line. A bite is set up just above the last knot. The right‑edge dermis is lifted, the needle drives from right to left along its arc, exiting the far edge at a matched level. The suture is drawn across, slack is removed, and an instrument tie secures the approximation. The knot is cinched down so it rests precisely over the midline of the wound; tails are trimmed short. The next bite is then prepared slightly proximal to the last, using the same spacing and depth that matches the previous stitches, building a row that is both consistent and cosmetically mindful.

There are brief moments of instrument repositioning without tissue passage—times when the driver is visible above the superior end of the wound and the needle is being reloaded to optimize entry angle for the next pass. Occasionally, the dominant hand temporarily withdraws while the other hand maintains control of the suture tail or steadies the tissue. In one such segment, the driver moves out of the field and returns with the needle reoriented; in another, the forceps approach the lateral right side to re‑establish countertraction while preparing to resume. These pauses do not interrupt the continuity of the line being closed; rather, they support safe, precise placement of the next stitch.

As the operator advances toward the apex of the wound, the same sequence repeats: entry on one side with the needle perpendicular to the surface, a smooth arc across the gap, exit on the opposing side, and gentle traction to draw the suture through. Edges are carefully everted and remain in apposition, aided by the spacing and even bite depth. Instrument ties are performed consistently—loops formed over the driver, the short end transferred with forceps, and throws seated squarely down onto the wound. The short ends are cut flush enough to be neat, but not so short as to risk unraveling.

Where visibility is briefly obscured—such as when the right hand crosses the field during tying—it is only momentary, and the subsequent frames confirm proper knot seating and wound edge control. In other segments, scissors enter from the left/superior side to trim tails while the driver holds the knot steady. From mid‑to‑inferior portions where the first stitches were seen, the bite line forms a slightly diagonal but orderly progression as the closure marches proximally; knot tails tend to lie on the right side, reflecting the direction in which the suture strands have been managed.

Near the superior third of the wound, the driver and pickups work more closely together to accommodate the tighter working space. The left hand often stabilizes the apex with forceps while the right hand aligns the needle. Entry remains perpendicular, even in this narrow segment, and the forceps provide just enough traction to present the dermis and avoid shallow, epidermis‑only bites. In several passes near the top, the driver releases and regrips the needle on its body to maintain a precise curvature through the tissue. The opposing hand occasionally grasps the needle tip to guide it through cleanly, keeping the exit site symmetrical with the entry.

As the closure nears completion, the operator alternates between placing a new stitch and finalizing the prior one. One sequence shows a stitch being passed at the very top of the wound with the suture drawn through, followed by another brief repositioning to set up the next pass; another shows the tightening and trimming of the just‑placed stitch with the needle resecured in the driver to continue. Even when a new pass is not completed within a given interval, the context is consistent: instruments remain at the superior end of the same right‑side incision, hands straddle the line, and the needle is actively being aligned for its next entry.

Throughout the case, the operator’s hands adapt to optimize ergonomics. At times the left hand is dominant with the needle driver while the right hand manages forceps and suture control; at other times, the right hand takes the driver and the left hand steadies and assists. The working triangle remains tight, and instrument crossover is avoided except when necessary to regrip the needle or to retrieve the tip on exit. The trajectory of each bite is aligned with the axis of the wound and the prior stitch row, preserving consistent spacing and avoiding dog‑ears or step‑offs.

Interspersed among these active segments are short windows with no visible manipulation of the wound—moments when the field is static or the camera is adjusting. These do not change the operative narrative. On occasion, the camera orientation makes the right‑of‑midline incision appear centered within the frame; regardless of perspective, the instruments, suture, and knots consistently track along the same wound, which already bears the accumulating series of simple interrupted stitches.

By the end of the observed sequence, the vertical incision on the right side of the pad is well approximated from its mid‑portion up toward its superior segment. Several neat, evenly spaced simple interrupted knots sit over the line, with short tails trimmed close, generally laying to the right. The dermal edges are everted without inversion, and there is no evidence of over‑tightening or undue tissue trauma. At the very top of the wound, a fresh pass has been completed and the suture drawn through; the needle is reloaded and being aligned for the next bite as the sequence concludes. The other two parallel incisions remain largely untouched except for early preparatory and teaching gestures away from the active closure.

Taken together, the procedure demonstrates a consistent, methodical interrupted suturing technique applied along a single linear wound: precise needle control with perpendicular entry, regrips as needed to follow the curve, gentle dermal eversion with pickups, instrument ties seated directly over the wound, and careful tail trimming. Spatial awareness is maintained throughout, with instruments straddling the wound and suture strands managed to keep the field clear. The result is a steadily advancing, cosmetically mindful closure of the right‑side incision, culminating in a well‑approximated wound with a short, tidy row of secure knots and a final bite being readied at the apex.
