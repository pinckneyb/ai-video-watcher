COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone skin pad that bears three parallel vertical cuts, but the work is focused on closing the single central midline incision from end to end. The operator maintains this focus throughout, occasionally bringing scissors or a driver in and out of the field, and intermittently repositioning hands to optimize access. The overall method is a series of interrupted sutures with instrument ties and tail trimming, applied in orderly sequence to approximate the skin edges with slight eversion and even spacing.

At the outset, the operator establishes instrument control and orientation over the pad. Forceps are used to gently evert a wound margin and the needle driver is aligned perpendicular to the skin, grasping the curved needle on its body at roughly the proximal-to-middle third (about two‑thirds from the tip). In the earliest moments of preparation, the camera briefly captures instruments hovering near a lateral incision; however, no sequence of bites or ties is advanced there, and the operative steps that follow proceed on the single central vertical incision and remain there. The central line is straight, short, and evenly bordered, with guide marks at its ends. Early stitches are placed near the lower half of this wound, where a previously tied knot is already visible, providing a reference for spacing and direction.

The first stitched pass shown across this central line is delivered with consistent fundamentals. The driver approaches the right edge nearly perpendicular to the surface; Adson-style pickups in the opposite hand gently lift the near dermis to present the edge, avoiding crush. The needle advances in its natural arc through the right margin at a controlled depth, then, after a brief regrip near the tip, follows the curve through the left margin to produce a symmetric mirrored bite. The suture is drawn through to establish approximation and set tension. Knot tying at this stage is not yet shown, but the entry and exit are equidistant from their respective edges, creating the foundation for even eversion.

Shortly after, attention turns to the lower end of the central incision where a knot is being secured and finished. The driver is used to manage the standing end and the forceps or free hand to manage the short end, forming instrument ties with multiple throws, cinched down over the incision. The operator exercises care to seat the knot squarely without crushing tissue, then transitions to cutting. Scissors are brought in with their tips angled to the knot so the tails can be trimmed short, leaving a neat, compact finish. This establishes the cadence that will repeat along the wound: pass, tie, trim; pass, tie, trim—always with consistent approach angles, mirrored bites, and gentle tissue handling.

The next sequence shows preparation for another stitch along the same central line. With scissors temporarily set aside, the driver again loads the needle two‑thirds from the tip and maintains a near‑90‑degree angle to the skin. The forceps are stationed just lateral to the intended entry, lifting the edge to evert the dermis. The needle passes left‑to‑right across the incision, and the suture is pulled through, approximating the edges. This is followed by instrument ties to secure the stitch in place. The operator demonstrates a reliable loop‑forming technique, alternating hands as needed: sometimes the right hand holds the driver to tie while the left manages the tail; at other times, the left hand holds the driver and the right hand provides counter‑tension. This ambidexterity ensures the knot seats directly over the incision without twisting the edges.

At one point, a corner stitch is shown at a right‑angle junction on the pad. The driver holds the needle at the proximal‑to‑middle third, and the pickups evert and stabilize both limbs at the corner apex. The bites are placed a few millimeters from each cut edge, capturing tissue that includes the apex so the corner is neatly approximated when the knot is tied. This sequence is consistent with a technique used to secure an incision’s corner or an angled terminus, and the knot is seated over the apex with multiple throws. Although a corner configuration is briefly depicted, the ongoing closure returns to the same central vertical line, and the working steps that follow continue that single line without diversion. No progress is sustained on the lateral slits, which remain unused throughout.

In the central wound, the closing continues in a standard, repetitive pattern. When a stitch is tied, the tails are trimmed—sometimes with suture scissors brought in from the left of the field, sometimes with a cutter on the driver—and the needle is reloaded in the driver for the next pass. The driver consistently aims perpendicular to the skin, following the needle’s curvature through the dermis and subdermal layer. The assisting hand with forceps everts the near side before the bite and then switches to present the opposite edge for exit, minimizing trauma and maintaining a clean arc. The operator frequently regrips the needle near the tip mid‑pass to complete the trajectory, then retrieves it on the far side, which keeps the entry and exit levels matched and supports even eversion.

As the line advances upward, one sequence shows the driver parked while the free end is controlled to complete instrument ties. The knot is tightened just above the previously placed series, expanding the closure superiorly. The scissors remain on the instrument table until the knot is secure, then are brought in to trim tails short against the knot. The movements are efficient and controlled: the driver stays centered over the incision axis; the pickups hover just lateral to the next target site, everting the edge and providing counter‑traction. The operator is careful not to disturb prior knots, except to trim tails when needed, keeping the previous stitches stable while new ones are added.

In the mid‑portion, the operator alternates between tightening throws, trimming tails, and reloading the needle for the next pass. One segment shows the left hand managing the driver centrally while the right hand uses forceps to steady the tissue at the midline and help tension the suture during tying. After completing another knot over the center, the scissors are brought in to cut the tails, and the needle is regrasped and repositioned to continue superiorly. The stitches are spaced so that each bite lands at a consistent distance from the edge, mirrored on the opposite side, leading to a uniform pattern of approximation along the wound.

At another stage, with several knots already present at the midpoint, the work transitions to the upper portion. The left hand first appears with scissors to trim a previous stitch; then the scissors are set aside and the right hand takes the driver loaded with a fresh needle. The left hand switches to forceps at the wound edge. The needle is mounted about two‑thirds from the tip and oriented perpendicular to the skin surface; it advances from the operator’s superior side across the centerline to the far edge. The forceps alternate sides to guide the entry and exit points, ensuring symmetry and preventing tissue slide. The edges are brought together with gentle tension as the suture is pulled through, then the driver is used to form instrument ties, securing the knot exactly over the incision. Tails are trimmed once the knot is stable, and the sequence repeats.

Wherever the camera shows the surgeon pausing to cut tails, the technique remains meticulous. The driver often stabilizes the knot by holding the standing end while the scissors approach from the opposite side, crossing hands above the incision to reach the knot without shifting the tissue. The scissor tips are angled precisely at the knot to cut without leaving long ends. When the scissors are not in use, they are placed off to the left side of the field. Periodically the needle is parked in the driver while tying, and occasionally the operator brings in a marking pen to note spacing or reference points; then the driver is picked up again to continue the next bite.

Mid‑to‑late in the sequence, with the central line partially closed and several evenly spaced sutures visible, the surgeon continues to add stitches along the upper half. The driver remains just above and centered over the incision, while the pickups alternate sides to present the target edge for each pass. The needle is repeatedly reloaded to maintain a 90‑degree approach, advanced through one edge, regrasped near the tip mid‑curve, and then delivered through the opposite edge. After each pass, the strand is drawn through to snug the approximation, and instrument ties are performed to secure the stitch. This pattern advances methodically toward the top of the wound. Even when the field of view shifts or hands alternate roles—left hand driving and right hand assisting, then right hand driving and left hand assisting—the method stays consistent: perpendicular entry, curved path through the dermis, controlled exit, instrument tie, trim.

One segment captures the lower half again, where the driver forms additional throws to finish a knot; scissors then trim the tails. Immediately after, the operator continues along the same line with fresh bites, indicating that the closure proceeds in both directions as needed to maintain spacing and access, but always on the same incision. In another run, the left hand takes scissors to cut tails while the right hand stabilizes the knot with the driver; after trimming, the scissors are set down, and the needle is reloaded to resume suturing. Throughout, previously placed knots are not disturbed; the driver and pickups work close to the stitch line to avoid gapping, and tension is applied just enough to approximate without blanching.

In the final phases, the surgeon adds the last few stitches toward the superior end. As before, the pickups evert the edge gently while the needle enters perpendicularly, the arc is followed through, and the suture is drawn to set the edges flush and slightly everted. Instrument ties are completed with the driver centered over the line, and the forceps hand controls the free end, crossing over as needed during throws. The last knot is seated directly over the incision; scissors approach from the upper‑left to trim tails neatly. With the tails cut and the line evenly approximated, both hands move away and the instruments are placed on the table lateral to the pad.

By the end, the central vertical incision is closed with a sequence of neatly spaced, well‑seated interrupted stitches. Each knot lies centered over the line, the tails are trimmed short, and the edges are slightly everted with no visible gapping. The lateral slits seen in the field are not developed into closures; where they appear briefly, no sequential suturing is carried out on them. The technique remains consistent from start to finish: the needle is grasped around two‑thirds from the tip, presented at 90 degrees to the skin, advanced along its curve with mid‑pass regrips for control, and supported by gentle eversion with forceps. The driver forms secure instrument ties over each stitch, and the scissors cut close to the knot without disturbing the approximation. The completed wound demonstrates uniform bite depth and spacing, careful tissue handling, and an orderly progression of interruptions culminating in a tidy, fully approximated central line.
