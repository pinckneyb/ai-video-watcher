COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
This recording follows a single, central linear skin incision on the silicone practice pad through the entire session. The incision remains the focus from the first frame to the last: a short midline cut on the mock tissue, roughly a few centimeters in length, with wound edges that are clean and readily approximated. Over the course of the video the operator constructs a serial line of individually placed interrupted sutures along that same incision using a curved swaged needle and standard needle drivers/forceps, progressing from initial needle passes through to final knot security and suture tail management.

Opening sequence — initial needle passage and bite placement
At the outset the operator approaches the central incision from the standard opposing-hand configuration: one hand stabilizes and provides counter-traction while the other controls the needle. The curved needle is routinely grasped in a needle driver or fine forceps near its mid‑shaft (sometimes a little closer to the hub) to maximize control over the arc of passage. The instrument that holds the needle is alternately the right- or left-sided needle driver depending on the specific maneuver, but most commonly the right hand drives the needle while the left hand approximates tissue with toothed Adson-style forceps or a ringed needle driver acting as a second hand.

Needle entry is deliberate and performed in short controlled arcs through the epidermal/dermal mock tissue. The operator generally orients the driver so the needle tip is directed toward the opposite wound edge, aiming for a transverse / perpendicular trajectory through the skin plane. During each pass the counter-traction instrument elevates or steadies the near edge, permitting a full-thickness superficial bite of the skin equivalent (epidermis and dermis layers of the pad) without undue puckering. Slight eversion of the margins is consistently created as each bite is taken, reflecting the operator’s intention to produce edge apposition with eversion to optimize closure.

Serial interrupted stitch placement
Throughout the first half of the record the operator places multiple interrupted stitches in a serial fashion along the length of the incision. Each stitch is performed as a discrete event: the needle is passed through one side, then through the opposing side, the suture is drawn through until the appropriate tail length remains for knot tying, and the knot-tying sequence is completed before the next fresh bite is started adjacent to the prior stitch. Instrument positions are predictable and consistent: one instrument on each side of the incision, tips converging over the wound with a working distance of roughly one to three centimeters, affording precise control in the narrow operative window.

Needle handling details are consistent: the curved needle is grasped mid‑shaft to allow rotation through the tissue in the natural curvature; the driver is periodically re-grasped nearer the hub for stronger control during deeper or more constrained bites. The needle is advanced in short arcs with the tip penetrating the dermal layer and exiting the opposite margin, and the suture tail is held and tensioned with a hemostat or forceps before knot tying.

Variation in handedness and instrument exchange
Over the course of the session the operator changes instrument grips and occasional hands-on roles in a fluid manner. Some passes show the right hand as the primary needle driver while the left hand stabilizes tissue; other frames demonstrate the left-hand needle driver controlling the needle and the right hand providing counter-traction with forceps. These swaps are accomplished quickly and deliberately, with instruments exchanged or placed to the side between maneuvers. Scissors and suture-cutting tools are introduced later in the timeline to trim tails once knots are secured.

Knot tying and suture management
After each stitch is placed the operator secures the suture with standard knot-tying maneuvers performed within the small working space. Knot formation is achieved using combinations of needle drivers/hemostats and fine forceps: one instrument controls the suture loop(s) while the other manipulates the free tail to produce square knots (or equivalent secure throws). The operator repeatedly brings fingertips and instrument tips close together over the wound to maintain tension control and to seat each knot snugly against the tissue surface. Slight eversion is maintained during knot securing, and excessive tension is avoided to prevent tissue strangulation.

Once the knot is secure, scissors or a second hemostat are brought in to cut the suture tails short. These cutting maneuvers typically occur with one hand stabilizing the tissue and the other trimming the tail; finger pads or thenar eminence are used at times to steady the area while the cutter approaches. After trimming, the operator briefly inspects the approximation and uses the forceps/fingers to smooth or adjust any residual tension before moving to the next adjacent site.

Transitions between placement and finishing activities
Throughout the recording the activity alternates between placing additional interrupted stitches at successive positions along the incision and attending to previously placed sutures (tightening, adjusting knots, trimming tails, or inspecting approximation). There are periods where no fresh needle passes are visible—during these intervals the operator organizes suture limbs, tightens knots on adjacent stitches, manipulates suture tails with a hemostat and trims them with scissors. These finishing activities are interleaved with further placements: after completing knot work on one stitch the operator will again position the needle for the next bite lower or higher along the incision and repeat the pass/tie/trim cycle.

Technique consistency and orientation of bites
The suturing pattern remains consistent: interrupted sutures placed with small, evenly spaced bites oriented to approximate edges with slight eversion. In several descriptions the technique is characterized as interrupted mattress/vertical or vertical-style interrupted sutures; regardless of minor frame-to-frame descriptors, the operative approach maintains the individual interrupted configuration with separation between stitches and discrete knotting for each throw. Bites are superficial to the mock-tissue block (epidermal–dermal equivalent) rather than deep full-thickness passes into underlying materials beyond the skin analogue.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
At the beginning of the procedure hands generally sit lateral to the incision, opposing one another with the instrument tips approaching the center. As the session progresses and knot-tying becomes predominant, both hands shift toward a more over-the-wound posture: fingertips, thenar eminences or instrument handles come to rest directly adjacent to or just over the stitches to stabilize the region during knot placement and suture cutting. The working gap between the two instruments remains small throughout—typically a couple of centimeters—allowing precise control of needle trajectory and efficient transfer between needle driving and knot tying.

Instrument movement patterns show predictable crossing and convergence directly over the suture line. The left-sided instrument often anchors suture limbs and provides lateral counter-traction, while the right-sided instrument manipulates the needle or performs knot work; when the handed roles reverse, the opposite pattern is observed with the same spatial convergence. Exchanges and instrument placement off to the left side of the field occur when scissors or alternative tools are introduced, but these are brief and the hands rapidly reconverge over the incision.

Tissue interaction and wound apposition
Across the entire session the operator maintains careful tissue handling: forceps are used to lift and align wound edges, and light digital pressure is occasionally applied to confirm apposition. Edge eversion is a consistent goal, and the operator avoids excessive tension that would cause significant tissue distortion. The bites are taken at consistent depth through the skin analogue and oriented to bring the dermal edges into close alignment. No large undermining, deep closure layers, or complex tissue dissection is performed—actions are limited to superficial skin layer approximation appropriate for a teaching/training platform.

Finishing the closure
In the latter time segments most activity shifts toward securing and tidying the closure. Knots are finalized, suture tails trimmed flush, and the wallet of suture limbs arranged so that each knot lies neatly over its respective bite. Several frames depict the operator stabilizing the wound with fingertips or a thenar surface while the opposite hand trims suture tails, indicating the final quality-control steps of the closure. The operator inspects the line—sometimes using small adjustments with forceps or fingers—to ensure even tension and consistent edge eversion.

Final state of the incision
By the end of the recording the incision is uniformly approximated along its full length with a serial line of individually tied interrupted sutures. The wound margins lie in close opposition with slight, deliberate eversion at each suture, and knots are snug and trimmed. Suture tails have been managed and the area appears tidy and secure. No additional needle passes are being made in the final frames; activity is limited to final touches—stabilization, inspection, and suture trimming—before completion.

Notes on procedural variances and observations
Throughout the recording the single midline incision remains the sole focus. The technique is consistently an interrupted approach (described in supporting data as interrupted/mattress or vertical interrupted pattern), and while individual frames occasionally emphasize knot management or tensioning rather than fresh needle passes, the overall pattern is the serial placement of interrupted stitches along the same linear defect. Grip placement on the needle varies between mid‑shaft and nearer the hub depending on the maneuver (placement versus knotting), and the operator comfortably alternates which hand acts as the dominant needle driver when task demands require instrument exchange. All handling is performed on the synthetic epidermal/dermal model; bites are superficial and aimed at reliable skin-edge approximation rather than deep structural closure.

In summary, the case documents a careful, methodical closure of a single midline linear incision using a sequence of individually tied interrupted sutures. The operator repeatedly passes a curved swaged needle through opposing edges under fine counter-traction, secures each stitch with controlled knot-tying technique, trims tails, and inspects the line to ensure even apposition and slight eversion. Hand positions remain tightly focused over the wound throughout, evolving from opposing lateral grips for needle passage to an over-the-wound posture for knot securing and trimming, with instruments crossing and converging in a coordinated fashion to complete a tidy, stable skin closure.
