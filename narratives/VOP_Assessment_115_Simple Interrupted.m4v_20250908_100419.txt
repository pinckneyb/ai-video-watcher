Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Overall flow is measured and deliberate, progressing from careful setup and orthogonal positioning to a consistent pass–tie–cut rhythm. Bimanual coordination is solid: the non‑driving hand reliably everts and manages slack while the driver follows the needle’s curve cleanly, and instrument ties are executed with reliable post control and alternating throws that stack neatly without edge distortion. Instrument traffic is economical, with tools parked laterally and the field kept visible and clean, including during suture removal.
