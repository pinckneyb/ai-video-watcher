COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel vertical cuts. The left slit already shows multiple completed interrupted stitches with trimmed and untrimmed tails lying along its length; the central slit bears puncture marks and a previously placed strand in its midline; and the right‑most slit is clean, open, and free of knots. From the outset, the surgeon commits to closing the right‑side slit using simple interrupted technique, with the instruments and motions returning to this line again and again as the procedure unfolds. Occasional glimpses of previously worked areas appear, but the operative effort develops, stitch by stitch, on the right‑side wound.

The first moments are all about setup and establishing the first pass on the right cut. The right hand elevates and everts the right wound edge with Adson forceps, while the left hand approaches with a needle driver holding a curved needle at roughly the proximal third to mid‑third, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. The tip is positioned just outside the epidermal edge with the curvature aligned to drive from lateral/right toward medial/left. The surgeon works with triangulation: forceps stabilize and present the dermis a few millimeters from the edge, and the driver brings the needle through in a controlled forehand arc. After penetrating the near lip outside‑in, the needle arcs across the gap toward the opposite edge. Tension on the strand is gentle and purposeful; there is no crushing of the synthetic dermis. As the suture is pulled through, a long end trails diagonally across the field from the new pass, setting up the line for tying.

There is a brief early interlude in which a central midline strand is seen being tensioned and arranged over the center slit, with the driver used to guide the existing throws and straighten the lay of the suture. No new needle passes occur in that view, and no forceps are used to evert or stabilize tissue there. This appears to be a momentary check or teaching demonstration on an already manipulated midline cut rather than an advancement of the ongoing closure, and within moments the effort returns to the right‑most slit.

Back at the right wound, the surgeon repeats the reliable ergonomics: forceps in one hand to evert, needle driver in the other to deliver a perpendicular entry. The needle is mounted two‑thirds from the tip for firm control, the driver is set in line with the planned arc, and the right wound edge is lifted to expose the dermis. The needle is advanced across the slit, released and regrasped as needed, and the strand is drawn through to leave two working ends. Early instrument ties begin forming; loops are created with the driver and the free end is retrieved and tensioned. Ties are cinched squarely over the incision, with the throws centered in the midline. When tying gives way again to placement, the technique remains the same: small, even, full‑thickness bites, orthogonal needle entry, and minimal, deliberate traction on the tissue.

At points the camera briefly revisits the central incision, capturing the surgeon positioning for a bite with the same careful orientation—forceps on the far/right edge, needle driver on the near/left, perpendicular entry planned—but no clear pass is completed in that view. The hands and instruments then resettle decisively over the right‑side slit, and placement on that line continues.

As the right incision becomes the unambiguous focus, the hand roles occasionally swap to suit access. Sometimes the left hand brings the needle driver from medial/central toward the right‑side slit while the right hand stabilizes the near/right lip with forceps; other times, particularly when working more superiorly, the right hand assumes the driver and the left hand provides countertraction and retrieval. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument, the choreography remains consistent. The driver grasps the needle at the proximal third or mid‑third for leverage; the needle tip is oriented near‑perpendicular to the skin; and the bite is executed by rotation, not by pushing, allowing the curve to carry the point through the skin pad’s dermal layer with accuracy. The forceps lift and evert the edge just enough to present the dermis and control the bite; once the tip emerges, the assisting hand either retrieves the needle directly with forceps or the driver releases and regrips to complete the arc and pull the suture through.

Where tying is undertaken, the sequence follows standard instrument tie mechanics. The driver forms the loop over the free end, the assisting instrument or hand feeds and catches the tail, and the knot is seated by pulling symmetrically across the incision. Throws are alternated to square the knot and ensure it lies directly over the wound line. The surgeon is attentive to where the knot lands: loops and tails are centered, not off to one side. When necessary, scissors appear briefly to trim the tails after completion, and then are set aside. Throughout, the pads of the instruments remain parallel to the incision, minimizing awkward crossing and keeping a clear view of the wound.

As the line progresses, new stitches are placed along the right incision’s mid‑portion into the upper half. In one sequence, the left hand advances the needle holder across the wound while the right hand on the far edge stabilizes the tissue and, after entry, briefly takes the needle to reorient and draw the suture through—classic teamwork for a full‑thickness pass. In another, the right hand holds the driver and executes a forehand entry perpendicular to the skin, with the left forceps everting the edge; the needle passes through the near edge outside‑in, arcs gracefully across, and is retrieved on the far edge inside‑out. The resulting strand lies across the wound, and, after a measured pull, the edges approximate neatly.

There are moments where no new pass is taken; instead, the surgeon is tying down an already placed stitch. With one hand the driver forms loops, and with the other the pickups or even fingers pull the free end. The knot is dressed and seated, and tension is modulated to prevent over‑tightening. In one such tightening sequence, the needle is largely parked; the driver jaws are used like a clamp to grasp the suture for better control while the free end is tensioned and the throws are stacked. The tissue is quiet and well approximated while this knot construction is completed.

A single, isolated sequence shows the left slit with several recent interrupted stitches and loose strands, but with no hands in the field. A driver and a syringe rest off to the lower‑left of the pad, idle. No manipulation is underway there; this is a static view that does not alter the progress of the work on the right‑side incision. At another point, the camera again catches activity away from the right slit; a few passes appear to be made on the left incision. This is inconsistent with the otherwise continuous development of the right‑side closure and reads as a separate teaching moment or cutaway. The closure being traced here remains the right‑side wound, which continues to receive new bites and knots before and after these brief diversions. The inconsistency is noted, but the technique description that follows reflects the continuous work on the right slit.

Returning to the main line, the operator completes at least one full interrupted stitch with tying and tail cutting on the right incision. The pass is delivered with the driver held left‑of‑center, the forceps lift the near/right edge, and after passage the instruments meet mid‑pad for knot construction. The knot is laid down over the wound, and the scissors trim the tails to a reasonable length. The field clears, showing a neatly seated knot centered over the incision with edges coapted beneath it.

With that stitch secure, the surgeon advances to the next site on the same slit. Again the right hand often takes the driver, grasping the needle at the proximal third and aligning the tip at a right‑angle to the skin. The left forceps stabilize and evert the target lip; the driver’s wrist rotation arcs the needle through the near edge and across to the far edge. The forceps are used to grasp the needle on exit and pull the strand through. This sequence occurs several times across the midline of the right slit, each time leaving two free ends ready for tying. In one mid‑sequence view, the suture already spans the incision as a loop, and attention is on securing it: the operator uses the driver and, at times, switches to the opposite hand to maintain the most ergonomic angle for forming and seating the throws. The strand is tensioned symmetrically, and multiple throws are placed until the knot is stable. No additional bites are attempted while tying; the focus is entirely on securing that stitch with precision.

Between placements, there are preparatory intervals where the needle is reloaded. The right hand reloads the needle two‑thirds from the tip, verifies the perpendicular orientation, and rehearses the angle of approach over the next target point in the upper third of the right slit. The left instrument hovers at the far edge, ready to stabilize when the pass begins. In one setup shot, the forceps approach the edge but do not yet engage; this is the surgeon pausing to evaluate alignment and depth before committing the tip to the dermis.

On at least one occasion, tying proceeds without drivers: the surgeon uses the right hand alone to pinch and pull the suture ends, advancing and seating tension by hand. The index finger rides along the wound edge to protect the tissue and guide the knot down, ensuring the throws land squarely over the incision and that no slack remains. This finger‑assisted dressing of the knot complements the instrument ties seen elsewhere and underscores a consistent principle: control the lay of the suture and keep the forces balanced to avoid tissue strangulation.

Throughout the closure, tissue handling is careful. The Adson forceps take small bites of the dermal edge rather than crushing grasps; edge eversion is slight but sufficient. The needle is driven by rotation, not by pushing, preserving the arc and minimizing tearing. The bites are symmetric on each side of the slit, aiming for even depth and distance from the edge. No undermining is attempted; this is a straightforward, layered‑agnostic skin closure on a synthetic pad, and the technique remains faithful to simple interrupted principles from start to finish.

Instrument roles flex as needed. Early on the left hand frequently carries the driver and the right hand the forceps. As the surgeon works up toward the superior half of the wound, the right hand sometimes takes the driver to maintain a natural forehand motion relative to the target edge, with the left hand sliding into a supporting role to stabilize tissue, retrieve the needle, or manage the free end. When tying, it’s common to see the left hand’s driver forming loops and the right hand’s forceps retrieving and tensioning; at other times the right hand’s driver forms the loop while the left hand brings a second instrument or fingers to assist. This ambidexterity helps maintain proper angle and visibility over both the mid‑portion and upper segments of the slit and keeps the knot heads consistently centered over the line.

Spatially, the work remains concentrated over the right‑most incision. The driver generally approaches from medial/left across to the right edge, while the forceps sit laterally at the right margin during entry and then cross to the opposite side to guide exit. The instruments oppose each other across the wound, forming a stable working triangle. The suture often drapes diagonally across the field, reflecting the direction of pull as it is drawn taut. When tying, hands converge over the wound and then move apart to set the knot. Other regions of the pad are largely untouched except during those few brief cutaways; when they appear, they do so as static background or short demonstrations that do not change the continuous progression of the right‑side closure.

As the sequence enters its later stages, several new passes are placed in the mid‑to‑upper portion of the right slit. One pass is executed with the curved needle clamped about two‑thirds from the tip, the arc aligned to pass from near to far, the forceps lifting the far lip to facilitate a precise exit. The needle is briefly transferred to the forceps to free the driver for regrasping and then the suture is drawn through, leaving two ends. Another pass mirrors this but occurs slightly superiorly, setting up the next knot site. Following placement, there is a run of tying sequences: the driver and forceps take turns forming loops, catching the tail, and cinching throws, with the knot heads consistently corralled over the incision’s midline. In some frames this is done entirely with instruments; in others the right hand uses fingers to dress and seat the knot.

Even when the needle is not in tissue, the driver remains active—pinching the strand to apply graduated tension, guiding the throws into place, and lifting the knot slightly off the surface so it can be eased down in a controlled fashion. The surgeon avoids seesawing forces that might shear the tissue, favoring steady, symmetric pulls. When a knot is secure, tails are trimmed; when it is not yet time to cut, the suture ends are left of adequate length to allow further handling, lying neatly off to the side.

By the end of the recorded sequence, the right‑side slit has progressed from an untouched, open wound to one with multiple newly placed and secured simple interrupted stitches along its mid‑portion, extending toward the upper half. Where knots are seated, the edges are well approximated beneath them, and where a new pass has just been placed but not yet tied, two free ends are visible, ready for instrument ties. The knots sit squarely over the line, their throws stacked cleanly, and the tails, where cut, are modest. The surgeon is in the act of reloading the needle for another superior pass when the view shifts briefly and then the field quiets. Instruments lie off to the lower‑left in an idle position during a static shot of the pad; the left wound’s previously placed stitches remain undisturbed and the central slit shows earlier puncture marks with a strand in place, but neither receives further attention.

In sum, the procedure demonstrates a stepwise, consistent simple interrupted skin closure on the right‑most incision. The technique develops predictably: stabilize and evert with forceps; orthogonal needle entry with controlled wrist rotation; pass from near to far following the curve; retrieve and draw the strand through; tie with instrument throws centered over the wound; trim when appropriate; and move to the next site along the same incision. Hand positions adapt to maintain ergonomic, forehand passes and clear visualization, with instruments opposing each other across the wound to preserve triangulation. The spatial discipline keeps work focused on the chosen slit, and even where cutaways briefly show other areas, the operative narrative returns to the same right‑side line, where the sequence of placement and tying continues. The final state is a partially but substantially approximated right‑side wound with neatly seated interrupted knots over the midline and preparation underway to continue superiorly, reflecting careful tissue handling and attention to knot placement throughout.
