COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with deliberate setup and the first needle drive. At 0–14 s, the left hand stabilizes the inferior edge of the left vertical incision with pickups while the right hand, having picked up the needle at the proximal-to-middle third, presents it perpendicular and drives in a smooth arc through the near dermis. The suture trails free and is kept out of the working tip as the initial pass is completed.

By 15–29 s the emphasis shifts to tying. The lower central wound has already been traversed; slack is drawn through, and the right hand manages the free strand while the left hand returns with a needle driver to perform instrument ties. The driver opens and closes to capture the short end as the first throw is formed and brought down over the entry/exit points.

At 30–44 s the rhythm of a standard instrument tie is clear. Working along the left margin, the driver alternately grasps the standing and short limbs while the right hand presents and tensions the opposite limb. Alternating throws are seated and squared with opposing traction, advancing the knot down to the tissue without crushing.

From 45–59 s the knot is finished over the lower-left slit. The left-hand driver is reintroduced from the upper left as a knot pusher and stabilizer while the right hand pulls the complementary strand to snug and center the throws. The needle lies off to the right, and the final knot sits neatly with tails directed laterally as the field is briefly cleared.

A new stitch begins at 60–74 s on the short lower-left slit. The right hand, now holding a gold-handled needle driver, has the needle grasped at the proximal-to-mid third, oriented to the skin. The right hand drives through the near edge; the left-hand instrument, initially parked vertically at the left, lifts to capture the tip as it emerges. A controlled hand-to-hand transfer follows and the suture is pulled through smoothly to length.

The sequence continues at 75–89 s with reloading and another precise pass. The right hand uses forceps to assist, regrasping the needle at its proximal third and aligning it perpendicular to the incision. The left-hand driver advances the arc from left to right with the right hand stabilizing tissue edges during entry and exit. The bite depth and spacing are symmetric (about 3–5 mm), and after the pull-through the wound edges approximate with modest eversion. The driver is briefly parked while the right hand manages slack, then work resumes.

By 90–104 s, no new tissue penetration occurs. The left-hand needle driver returns to the knot site to regrasp and fine-tune the position of the needle and suture adjacent to the knot. The right hand briefly assists with forceps to orient the needle/suture for control, then withdraws. Both hands leave the field, leaving a stable stitch centered in view.

The action returns decisively at 105–119 s to the small lower-left wound. The left hand uses tissue forceps to gently evert and stabilize the near edge while the right hand, with the needle loaded at the proximal third, presents a perpendicular bite and drives across the laceration. After exit, the right hand releases and regrips to deliver the needle and pull the strand to the right, creating a long free end and clearing the field.

Knot tying occupies 120–134 s. The needle is parked in the tissue; the left hand uses the needle driver purely as a tying tool. Loops are formed on the standing limb, the driver crosses to seize the short tail presented by the right hand from the inferior-right, and the first throw is cinched. The sequence reverses for the second throw to form a square knot, with an additional securing throw placed. Each throw is seated with even, opposing tension to maintain edge approximation.

At 135–149 s, the operator multitasks between preparing the next bite and finishing prior stitches. The left hand keeps the needle driver poised above the field near the left side, adjusting the needle to a perpendicular stance near the right-sided incision without committing to a pass. The opposite hand alternates: first manipulating the free suture, then briefly everting the right wound edge with tissue forceps to identify a target bite, and finally switching to gold-handled scissors to trim tails on interrupted sutures already completed on the left wound. The needle is set aside while trimming is completed, then instruments withdraw.

Setup and control dominate 150–164 s over the left-central incision. The left-hand driver is stationed as a stabilizing post near the superior-left wound margin while the right hand, alternating between forceps and a driver, regrips the needle about two-thirds from the tip and aligns the curvature. Suture slack is drawn laterally to the right to straighten the strand and prevent tangles, with minimal direct tissue handling.

Tying resumes at 165–179 s for a central-left stitch. The right hand, holding the driver, executes instrument ties while the left hand pinches and tensions the short tail. The needle remains parked away from the wound to avoid inadvertent puncture. Throws are alternated and brought down squarely, approximating the edges by suture tension alone.

From 180–194 s, additional securing throws are placed and the knot is seated. The left hand maintains the standing end and uses the driver to push and square the knot; the right hand works the short end through each loop. The needle is positioned lateral to the right, out of harm’s way during tying. Near the end of this interval, scissors are reintroduced to prepare for trimming.

The sequence concludes at 195–208 s with final set and withdrawal. The right hand centers over the left-central incision and pulls along the axis of the wound to snug the last throw, while the left-hand driver stabilizes just superior-left to the knot. After the final tensioning, both hands withdraw, leaving a series of neat, simple interrupted sutures across the worked incisions with trimmed tails and the field at rest.

Across the video, the technique follows a consistent cadence: precise needle loading and perpendicular presentation, controlled passes with hand-to-hand transfers, deliberate parking of the needle during tying, square instrument ties with alternating throws, and tidy tail trimming. Hand positions evolve fluidly—sometimes the right hand drives and the left receives; at other times the left hand posts or ties while the right manages suture, forceps, or scissors. Instruments avoid crossing excessively, and the suture is kept off the wound when not in use. The overall flow is unhurried and methodical, progressing bite by bite and knot by knot to approximate edges on multiple slits of the practice pad before the final, clean departure from the field.
