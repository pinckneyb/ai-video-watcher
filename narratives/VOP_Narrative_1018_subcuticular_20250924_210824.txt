COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses on the short transverse skin incision located at the superior-most horizontal slit of the practice pad — the upper‑central wound of the three parallel incisions. From the first frames through the end of the recording the operator returns repeatedly to that same superficial linear defect and advances a series of individual epidermal/dermal stitches to restore edge apposition. The approach is methodical and consistent: a curved, swaged needle is used throughout, tissue is held with fine pickup forceps or toothed Adson-style forceps, and the dominant hand manipulates a needle driver to take small, controlled bites. The following narrative traces the entire sequence from initial passes through final handling of the completed interrupted closures, describing needle handling, tissue interaction, hand positions, instrument choreography and the evolving state of the wound.

Initial approach and first passes
At the outset the superior incision is exposed with both hands immediately adjacent to the wound. The non‑dominant hand stabilizes and everts the near edge with fine forceps while the dominant hand brings a curved needle in a needle driver into the field. The needle is consistently grasped on the shaft — typically mid‑shaft to the distal third — rather than at the swage or very tip, allowing a controlled rotational arc. Early bites are shallow and perpendicular or slightly oblique to the skin surface. The operator lifts the near edge slightly with the forceps to create purchase and aligns the dermal surfaces so that the needle can be driven through the opposing edge with minimal tissue drag.

Each stitch begins with bimanual coordination: the forceps lift/evert and provide counter‑traction while the driver rotates the curved needle through the far edge, then through the near edge in an arc that uses the curvature to complete the pass with a short, precise motion. As the needle tip exits the opposite margin, the suture filament is pulled through so that a neat loop lies over the pad. Throughout these early frames the operator avoids deep tissue penetration; bites are targeted to the epidermal/dermal analog of the model to effect superficial closure appropriate for epidermal approximation on the practice material.

Establishing the running pattern of interrupted bites
After the initial pass the operator repeats the sequence adjacent to the previously placed stitch. The working zone remains compact — hands and instruments invariably remain within a few centimeters of the incision — and the needle driver and forceps frequently cross or bracket the wound as they exchange tasks. The needle driver most often approaches from the operator’s right or the upper‑right quadrant of the frame while the forceps are positioned to the left of the needle path; occasionally the approach alternates (driver from above or upper-left) depending on which segment of the incision is being addressed, but the close working geometry persists. Each subsequent bite mirrors the preceding technique: mid‑shaft grip of the curved needle, controlled rotation to drive the tip through tissue, elevation and eversion of the near edge with the forceps, then retrieval and externalization of the suture loop.

Formation and management of suture loops
As stitches accumulate along the top incision the operator manages the free suture tails in a deliberate fashion. After each pass the thread is pulled through and allowed to lie in a loop over the pad; at times the assistant fingertips or forceps manipulate the loop to keep it out of the needle path. The left hand (or nondominant hand) plays a continuous role in stabilizing edges and handling suture tails, while the dominant hand repositions the needle driver to prepare for the next bite. Instrument exchanges are occasionally noted: scissors and hemostats are present in the field and are used later for knot security and tail trimming, but during the bulk of the sequence the focus is on precise needle control and edge approximation rather than rapid cutting.

Regional progression along the incision
The operator works along the length of the superior incision in a stepwise manner. At times the center of the wound is addressed first, then lateral segments; in other sequences the lateral end is engaged and additional bites are placed medially. Regardless of direction, each new stitch is positioned adjacent to previously tied points to produce an even series of interrupted closures along the same line. The model shows prior interruptions inferior to the current site early on — indicating prior practice stitches — but the current recording documents the operator adding multiple new interrupted stitches along the superior incision and finishing any in‑progress bites before moving on.

Needle technique and bite depth
Throughout the video the operator maintains a consistent needle technique. A transverse/mid‑shaft grip predominates, with the needle oriented tip‑down and rotated through a controlled shallow arc. The bites taken are consistently superficial to full thickness of the practice pad’s epidermal analog — deep tissue layers are not engaged — producing slight eversion of the edges that is intentionally maintained to encourage epidermal apposition. The needle is passed perpendicularly through the dermal layer whenever possible; when working at the lateral ends a slightly oblique trajectory is used to ensure purchase near the incision terminus. The forceps provide fingertip pressure and counter‑traction to keep the edges opposed while the needle passes.

Hand positions and evolution over time
Hand positions remain tight around the incision for the entire case. In the earliest frames both hands hover directly above the superior incision with the left (nondominant) holding tissue forceps and the right (dominant) handling the needle driver; this bimanual configuration persists. As the session progresses, the relative approach angles vary: most commonly the needle driver approaches from the operator’s right and superior quadrants while forceps approach from the left or just lateral to the wound, but occasional segments show the needle driver coming from above or the upper‑left as the operator repositions to access a different bite angle. Hands cross briefly above the wound during needle withdrawal on several passes, and on some occasions both hands sit to the right side of the incision to finish a bite at the lateral end. Despite these small shifts, both instruments maintain a close spatial relationship — often 1–3 cm apart — to facilitate precise needle guidance and immediate control of the suture tail.

Instrument choreography and knot management
After passing and externalizing each suture, the operator prepares for knot tying. Many sequences finish a bite and then proceed directly to tensioning and knot formation; in other frames the operator pauses to place another adjacent bite before returning to tie. Near the latter portion of the recording the presence of scissors and a Kelly/hemostat indicates knot formation and tail management. The operator alternates between holding suture ends with forceps and using the needle driver or a long‑handled instrument to throw and secure knots. The final stages show instrument exchange to scissors and hemostats resting near the field and occasional use of a fingertip to steady the suture loop while tightening. The synthetic material obscures some detail of knot structure, but the actions are consistent with formation of standard interrupted knots and controlled trimming of tails.

Consistency of technique and small refinements
The technique is remarkably consistent throughout: controlled mid‑shaft needle grips, small perpendicular or shallow oblique bites, and deliberate eversion of the skin margins. Minor refinements are evident as the case progresses — the operator tightens suture loops more deliberately on later knots to minimize gaping and reduces the bite size when working at the lateral extremes of the incision to avoid puckering. There are moments when the forceps are used not only to evert but also to apply fingertip pressure to flatten the tissue while the knot is laid down, producing ever so slightly different tissue handling as stitches are completed. These refinements lead to a progressively better‑approximated line as the sequence advances.

Spatial relationships and working geometry
The instruments consistently bracket the incision. The needle driver is most often superior or lateral to the forceps and swings a controlled arc across the wound while the forceps sit counter‑lateral to receive the bite. When working the lateral end the pair may both come from the right side of the pad to access the endpoint. As stitches are placed, the suture tails trail across the pad toward the operator’s right in multiple frames; these loops are gathered and managed to keep the field clear for subsequent needle passes. During knot tying, instruments cross over the wound and occasionally rest on the pad as the operator alternates between holding the suture and tightening throws.

Tissue response and final approximation
The simulation tissue responds with slight eversion at each bite site and subtle puckering around tied knots; this is typical for interrupted techniques and reflects careful superficial bites that approximate epidermal margins without deep purchase. Over the course of the procedure the wound becomes progressively better apposed: initial small gaps and mild eversion are replaced by more consistent edge approximation as later knots are cinched with attention to alignment. In later frames the operator inspects and manipulates the standing suture, adjusting knots and trimming tails with small scissors. By the penultimate frames the incision shows a regular series of evenly spaced interrupted closures with the edges closely approximated; puckering at each knot is minimal and the overall contour of the incision is smooth.

Final handling and completion
In the terminal sequence instruments are repositioned for final inspection, knot security and trimming. A long hinged instrument is brought toward the sutured area and a hand enters from the upper‑left to manage remaining suture strands. Scissors and a hemostat are visible and used as needed to cut tails. No fresh needle passes are seen in the closing frames; instead the operator focuses on finishing the interrupted stitches already placed, ensuring knots are secure and tails are neat. The final visual shows the superior incision uniformly closed along its length by interrupted sutures, edges slightly everted but well opposed, and no residual gaping. The synthetic nature of the pad limits assessment of true dermal approximation, but on the model the closure presents as a stable, cosmetically sensible interrupted repair with tidy knot‑ends trimmed and instruments withdrawn.

Summary impression
Across the entire recording the operator employs a disciplined interrupted‑suture strategy to repair the topmost transverse incision. Needle management is deliberate — a curved swaged needle held mid‑shaft and driven in controlled arcs — while the nondominant hand consistently elevates and everts the skin edge. The working geometry remains compact, with the needle driver and forceps operating within a tight field and crossing as necessary to complete passes and tie knots. Small technique refinements — slightly smaller bites at the ends and more careful tensioning of later knots — improve approximation as the repair progresses. The procedure concludes with a neatly approximated transverse incision closed by a line of interrupted stitches, knots secured and tails trimmed, and the field cleared of instruments.
