============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with multiple parallel incisions, and throughout the session the surgeon focuses on closing the rightmost vertical wound using a simple interrupted technique. The work progresses methodically from the inferior portion of that line toward the middle and ultimately to the superior end, with occasional pauses for thread management, instrument repositioning, and knot tying. Forceps are used for edge control and eversion, and the needle is consistently oriented orthogonal to the skin surface to produce symmetric, well-spaced bites. Camera perspective and intermittent occlusion occasionally make it appear as if attention shifts toward the adjacent middle slit; however, the running thread management, knot sequences, and continuity of the already-approximated edges demonstrate that the closure remains on the rightmost incision from start to finish. Any frames that seem to engage the middle line should be read as momentary misalignment of camera perspective or preparatory hovering—the closure being described here occurs on the rightmost incision in a consistent simple interrupted pattern.

The session opens with both hands straddling the long rightmost cut. A new stitch is initiated at the lower segment of this line: the needle driver—held first in the right hand while the left controls the near edge with forceps—positions the curved needle perpendicularly to the skin. The forceps gently evert the dermis on the near lip, the needle tip is set just back from the epidermal margin, and the needle is driven in a controlled arc across the wound. The pass is completed, and slack is drawn through as the suture tail is oriented off to the side to prevent tangling with the completed portion above.

A second pass follows at the inferior end of the same wound, with the driver again controlling a perpendicular entry and the forceps providing countertraction and eversion. After the needle exits the far side, the driver regrips near the tip to complete the pull-through, and the suture is laid laterally across the field. The surgeon then pauses to manage tension and reload the needle for the next bite. During this brief interlude the forceps hover over the wound without taking a bite, and no new passage is made; the priority is setting up the needle-to-driver angle properly for perpendicular entry on the next stitch.

Once reloaded, the surgeon returns to the lower third of the rightmost incision and initiates another pass. In this sequence, the left hand assumes the driver, while the right hand lifts the near wound edge. This alternation of handedness recurs throughout the case, reflecting ergonomic adjustments as the working locus shifts along the wound. The needle is again grasped around the proximal third to mid-body and presented at 90 degrees to the skin. The pass proceeds with the same orthogonal arc, and the suture is drawn through, avoiding the previously placed knots.

Progressing along the lower segment of the cut, the surgeon completes one stitch and initiates knot tying. The needle is parked safely, and an instrument tie is performed: the needle driver alternates between grasping the short and long ends of the suture to form loops and lay down successive throws. The right-hand forceps stabilize the loop and help seat the knot. The knot is slid down cleanly to the skin and squared over the incision line without crushing the tissue. Tail management follows; scissors occasionally appear but cutting is not consistently captured during these frames.

The next sequence returns to placement. With the needle reloaded in the driver at the proximal third, the right wound edge is again everted and stabilized. The surgeon makes another perpendicular pass near the lower-middle portion of the line, taking care to match bite depth and distance from the wound margin to the prior stitches. The suture is pulled through and tensioned; the fresh loop is then organized in preparation for a knot. During the first moments of the subsequent pass, visualization is briefly compromised by the operator’s head crossing the field, but when view clears, both hands are again bracketing the same right-side wound and the pass continues across, maintaining even spacing with the existing sutures.

As the closure advances toward the midsection, there are brief periods dedicated to thread and loop control without new tissue penetration. The driver hovers over the wound while the assistant hand uses forceps or scissors to corral the free strand, tensioning it just enough to flatten loops and expose the intended next entry points. At times the needle is regripped multiple times to optimize the curvature alignment before committing to entry. This is especially evident as the surgeon prepares to move from the middle toward the superior third of the wound where angles change and access narrows.

In one knot-tying sequence, the right hand uses forceps to stabilize the loop while the left hand (with the needle driver) performs instrument ties, alternating which end is controlled to build the throws. The surgeon keeps hands low and close to the wound to maintain a short working distance, which helps seat the knot cleanly without torque. The final throw is snugged down with just enough tension to approximate the edges while preserving the slight eversion encouraged by forceps during bite placement. Throughout, previously placed stitches keep the edges approximated and guide uniform spacing.

Further up the wound, the surgeon places additional stitches using the same methodical approach. The left hand usually holds the driver, though there are short sequences where the right hand takes over for ergonomic reasons. The forceps are nearly always in the opposing hand, working the edge opposite the driver to present the dermis. The bites traverse dermis at matching depths across the incision, entry and exit points mirror each other, and the needle’s curvature is respected so the tissue isn’t torn. After each pass, the needle is regripped near the tip to complete pull-through, the strand is lifted out of the field, and slack is managed to avoid snagging on the previously placed knots.

As the closure proceeds into the upper half of the line, the surgeon occasionally pauses without taking a new bite—hovering to assess spacing, tension, and alignment of edges, then resetting the needle to ensure the next entry occurs at a true right angle. On several occasions the thread is drawn across the field and then returned, suggesting the surgeon is clearing loops from the working corridor and preventing entanglement with instruments and prior stitches. These interludes emphasize controlled pacing rather than rapid stitching, ensuring each interrupted suture lands precisely where intended.

The mid-to-upper portion includes an extended stretch of loop handling and knot setting. The driver remains centered over the wound while the opposite hand alternates between pickups and scissors, using each tool to guide the loop and tension the strand evenly. Knots are advanced straight down to the skin; any tail management seen is deliberate and measured, keeping tails short and directed away from the next bite site.

With the superior third in view, the surgeon makes preparatory adjustments to reach the top of the wound. The driver is reloaded with the needle grasped at the proximal third to mid-body; the needle is aligned orthogonal to the surface. The forceps briefly steady the needle tip, then shift to lift the epidermal edge at the apex. The subsequent pass at the top of the wound repeats the same principles: an orthogonal entry on one side, a controlled arc through dermis/subdermis, and a symmetric exit on the opposing side. The suture is pulled through and tensioned; edge eversion at the apex is maintained as the surgeon organizes the thread for tying.

During the final tightening sequences, the surgeon’s hands hover directly over the superior end of the line while the assisting hand manages the free strand off to the side. The driver and forceps occasionally cross above the incisional midline as needed to maintain optimal angles. At one point the needle is parked and the surgeon focuses on tensioning a newly placed stitch rather than taking another bite; this suggests attention to the final contour and even spacing of the last few knots in the series.

The culmination near the top of the wound shows a fresh pass with the suture drawn across the gap and tensioned, with knot tying imminent. Details of the tying sequence are intermittently obscured, and in one short burst only thread organization and loop positioning are visible without an actual throw being laid down. Nonetheless, the overall effect is a contiguous row of simple interrupted sutures that approximate the wound edges with mild, uniform eversion from bottom to top.

Throughout the case, spatial relationships remain consistent. The hands work in opposition across the wound: when the left holds the driver, the right holds forceps at the opposite edge, and vice versa. The needle is loaded with its curvature aligned to the intended direction of travel; entries are perpendicular, exits mirror the entry point across the incision, and the driver often regrips the needle to complete passage without tearing the tissue. The suture tail and long end are managed deliberately—often drawn laterally out of the working corridor—and loops are smoothed down before knots are advanced. Scissors appear intermittently for tail management but cutting is not consistently captured; still, knots are seen to be seated down neatly on several stitches. At certain times, particularly during setup for the next bite, the forceps are not actively lifting the edge; yet the previously tied sutures maintain approximation and basic eversion, facilitating the next precise pass.

Two recurring visualization issues appear: first, intermittent occlusion by the operator’s head in a few early frames, briefly obscuring entry points; second, camera perspective that makes the adjacent, parallel incision appear briefly in line with the driver. In some of these moments, the footage can give the impression that tissue handling is occurring on the middle slit. However, the flow of the suture thread, the location of the existing knots, and the persistent proximity of both hands to the rightmost row of stitches confirm the closure advances along the rightmost incision in a continuous manner. Where the description seems to attribute a bite to the neighboring slit, it is best interpreted as momentary repositioning or parallax rather than a change in the wound being closed.

The procedure concludes with the rightmost incision essentially closed by a well-aligned series of simple interrupted sutures. The inferior and mid portions show completed, tightened knots with tails positioned away from the wound. The superior end receives a final pass and is tensioned appropriately, with knot tying either just completed on the preceding stitch or imminent for the last one at the apex. Immediately afterward, the needle driver moves to hover over the adjacent central-right incision, poised to begin a new closure, but no needle penetration is made before the footage ends. The net result is a rightmost wound whose edges are approximated uniformly with consistent spacing, perpendicular bites, and slight eversion along the full length—a clean demonstration of simple interrupted technique performed with steady, well-coordinated instrument handling and disciplined suture management.
