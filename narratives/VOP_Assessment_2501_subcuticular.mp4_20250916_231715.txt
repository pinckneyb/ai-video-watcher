Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
You demonstrate solid fundamentals in needle control, gentle handling, and square knot formation; tissue is respected and approximation is sound. However, for a subcuticular closure, plane discipline is the non‑negotiable standard, and here the working line repeatedly exits the epidermis with surface knots along the active incision. That directly defeats the defining requirement of a subcuticular run and prevents continuous intradermal progression. To meet subcuticular standards: start with a buried intradermal anchor; maintain a shallow needle angle, taking 5–7 mm intradermal bites 2–3 mm from the edge with mirrored depth and length; advance continuously within the dermis without surface punctures until the terminal bury (Aberdeen or deep‑dermal finish) off‑line. Minimize instrument changes, keep pickups gentle and limited to dermal presentation, and maintain consistent bite cadence to produce a flat, uninterrupted skin line. The key corrective action is unwavering adherence to the intradermal plane with a buried start and finish.
