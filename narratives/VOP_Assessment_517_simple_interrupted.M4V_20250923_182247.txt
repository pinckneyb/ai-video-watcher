COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a synthetic skin pad with several pre-made cuts, but throughout the sequence the work remains focused on one wound: the vertically oriented incision running down the center of the pad. The activity begins on its lower portion and proceeds in a disciplined series of needle passes and instrument ties that progressively approximate the edges, moving through the lower, mid, and upper segments of this same line. Other slits on the pad are intentionally ignored for the duration.

The opening moments show the team securing a stitch already passed at the inferior third of the central vertical wound. The left hand holds a needle driver over the lower segment, while the right hand manages fine forceps and the short tail. The needle itself has already traversed the tissue and is largely parked; the driver is repurposed to perform instrument ties. Standard alternating throws are formed and ratcheted down centrally, with the forceps occasionally steadying the near skin edge and managing the tail so the knot sets directly over the incision without twisting the edges. The strand spans the wound in visible loops that are seated and snugged with controlled tension, bringing the edges into apposition.

Immediately afterward, attention shifts slightly superior along the same line. Working on the mid-portion of the vertical slit, the right hand holds the needle driver and the left hand takes forceps. The needle is grasped near its proximal third, perpendicular to the skin surface, and is driven in an arcing motion across the slit. The forceps lift and evert each margin just ahead of the needle, presenting the dermal edge for entry and then receiving the tip as it crosses. Once the pass is complete, both instruments move into tying positions over the midline, forming instrument ties that seat over the center of the incision. Early on, scissors briefly come into view but are not yet used to cut; the emphasis is on creating secure, alternating throws that flatten into a square knot and maintain even approximation over the middle of the wound.

The operator then returns to the lower-central area of this same vertical incision to place and secure another stitch. The driver, approaching from the left, presents the curved needle perpendicular to the skin and completes a pass through both sides at equal distances from the cut edge. With the pass completed, knot tying begins immediately. The non-instrument hand tensions the free end and stabilizes the tissue while the driver forms loops, grasps the opposite limb, and advances each throw down to the wound. Multiple reversing throws are applied to lock the knot, which seats neatly at the wound center. By the end of this interval, a stable knot sits over the lower-central segment, and the edges show gentle eversion with no gapping.

The next sequence prepares yet another stitch at the lower-central segment. A fresh needle–suture is readied in the right hand while the left hand assists as needed. The driver holds the needle around its mid-shaft, oriented to traverse the vertical wound from the right toward the left. After a brief setup, the new pass is executed: forceps (when used) lift the near edge for controlled entry, and the needle is advanced in a smooth arc across the incision and into the far edge at a symmetric depth. The left instrument receives the needle tip, facilitating a safe, controlled extraction and regrip. The suture is pulled through to leave a loop on the surface and prepare for tying. The instrument is then parked on the suture while the driver transitions to knot tying, forming sequential instrument throws and cinching them down over the center of the wound. The knot closes the local gap and achieves slight edge eversion, and at this stage the stitches across the lower-midline portion begin to show a consistent pattern and spacing.

As these early stitches consolidate the lower section, the operator continues working up the same central line. A momentary change in camera angle makes a short segment of the same wound appear oblique or even horizontal; despite that visual shift, the instruments and suture remain engaged on the same central incision. The technique is consistent: the left hand (often with toothed forceps) everts the right wound edge, and the right hand (with the needle driver) holds the needle on its proximal third and advances a right-to-left pass. After penetration, the needle is released and regripped to complete the arc, then handed off or retrieved as needed to pull the strand through. Throughout, traction is gentle and precise, with forceps taking the dermal margin rather than the epidermal surface to avoid crushing and to preserve eversion.

Once each pass is completed, the needle is commonly parked on the long strand while the driver executes instrument ties. The ties are consistently formed in alternating directions to square the knot and prevent slippage. At times, the left hand stabilizes the tissue or tail; at others, it briefly uses forceps or a second instrument to receive the exiting needle tip. The driver remains close to the midline, crossing the wound axis as needed to capture the appropriate limb and deliver each throw. Knots are guided down centrally, and tension is balanced so the edges meet with slight eversion and only minimal puckering.

As the series progresses, a knot at the lower central area is further snugged and then the needle is reloaded in preparation for the next bite. The operator repositions relative to the wound—left hand and instrument slightly superior-left, right hand and forceps slightly superior-right—so they can take another adjacent bite. The needle is held with the standard grip at the proximal third, concavity oriented to favor a natural arc through the tissue. The right wound edge is lifted and everted; the needle penetrates perpendicularly, traverses the dermis, and the exit is controlled on the opposite side. With the suture pulled through, the driver again functions as a knot pusher and grasper during tying, while the opposite hand alternately tensions the standing part and the tail. In this midline region, the series of throws lock into a flat, centered knot. When appropriate, scissors are brought in parallel to the incision to trim tails cleanly while the opposite hand stabilizes the strand, then the scissors withdraw to keep the field clear.

The middle of the sequence shows this cadence repeating reliably: setup, precise pass with forceps-assisted eversion, regrip and extraction, and then instrument ties with alternating directionality to square the knot. Spatially, the hands work in opposition across the incision, converging at the bite site and then separating laterally to tension and set the knot. The driver frequently crosses the wound axis during throws, while the assistant hand controls the tail at a consistent angle away from the midline—often inferior-lateral—so that the knot seats centrally without sliding to one side. Previously placed stitches begin to hold the wound in good approximation, and slight puckering around each knot reflects appropriate tension without strangulation.

As closure advances toward the lower third, the right hand drives another pass while the left hand uses forceps to guide needle exit and maintain eversion. After passage, the driver transitions immediately into tying. The knot is squared over the incision with alternating pulls and careful positioning of the limbs—keeping one on the near side and the other on the far side during each throw—to maintain symmetry. The result is a sequence of evenly spaced stitches across the lower segment, each one approximating the edges with a small ridge of eversion.

With the lower and middle segments consolidated, the focus shifts proximally along the same vertical line. Scissors appear to trim tails from a recent knot at midline, then withdraw. The needle is then reloaded in the driver’s jaws near the proximal third of the curve, the suture trailing to the left, and the instruments reposition to prepare a right-to-left bite near the superior portion. The forceps hover just lateral to the right margin at the intended entry site, poised to evert and precisely present the dermal edge. There is a brief pause as the setup is confirmed.

The next pass near the superior end is executed cleanly. The needle approaches perpendicular to the right epidermal edge and is driven from right to left across the incision. The driver releases and regrips as necessary to continue the arc through the tissue, and the needle is drawn out on the left side with a smooth, controlled motion. Forceps are active in this segment—lifting the right edge to create the entry point and then aiding the exit and re-entry control—so the bites remain symmetric with the correct depth for durable edge eversion. The suture is drawn through, a loop is laid out, and gentle traction brings the superior edges together in line with the preceding stitches. Hands stay in their established relationship: the driver left of the wound pulling across, and the forceps right of the wound guiding the bite, converging over the incision.

Once the superior pass is seated, multiple instrument ties secure it. The right hand keeps the driver centered over the midline wound; the left hand alternates between holding the tail and brief use of fine forceps to steady the edge while tensioning. The driver grasps the appropriate limb, the throw is formed and cinched down, and then the direction is reversed for the next throw to lock the knot. When the knot is stable and flat, scissors return briefly to trim the tails, and the wound line remains clean and free of stray loops.

This rhythm continues along the same upper-central portion: successive stitches are tied, with tails trimmed as needed. The driver largely remains centered over the wound axis, the assistant hand works just to the right of the incision pulling strands away to set and square each knot, and the edges maintain their eversion. The series of knots and short tails now forms a coherent, evenly spaced line down the center of the field, closely approximating the wound. The lateral slits on either side of the pad remain untouched and distant from the working hands and instruments.

The final segment shows a pause in activity. No hands or instruments are in contact with the wound, offering an unobstructed view of the finished segment. The midline incision, now bearing several closely spaced stitches, demonstrates slight wrinkling and puckering around each bite—consistent with appropriate tightening and edge eversion. The edges are approximated along the centrally closed segment, and no gaping is visible. With instruments absent, detailed assessment of bite angle or knot security is not possible in this view, but the overall appearance is of a well-aligned closure segment on the same midline wound that has been the focus throughout.

Technique and handling remain consistent from start to finish. The needle is routinely grasped near the proximal third of the curve and presented perpendicular to the skin edge for each entry. Passes are completed in a smooth arc with periodic regrips to maintain control, and forceps are used judiciously to evert and stabilize the dermal margin with minimal crushing. When tying, the needle is kept parked and safely out of the tissue plane, and the driver is used to perform and push down instrument ties. Throws alternate direction to square and lock each knot. The assistant hand manages strand tension and tail control, occasionally using forceps to steady tissue during seating. Scissors enter in-line with the incision to trim tails once knots are secure, then leave the field to avoid clutter.

Spatially, the hands often work opposite each other across the incision, converging at the point of action and separating to apply counter-tension. The driver may cross the wound axis during tying, while the assistant pulls the tail inferior-laterally or laterally to maintain symmetry and prevent lateral drift of the knot. The closure proceeds methodically from the inferior and mid sections toward the superior portion of the same vertical line, creating a uniform series of stitches that progressively eliminate the wound gap.

By the end, the central vertical incision is substantially approximated along the segment addressed in the video. Stitches are evenly spaced, knots are centered, and the edges are slightly everted with mild puckering—hallmarks of a careful technique. No other cuts on the pad have been engaged at any time, preserving the singular focus on this one wound. The procedure culminates in a clean, aligned suture line with trimmed tails and a consistent pattern of secure knots, and the final frames show a momentary pause with the completed segment left undisturbed. Any brief inconsistencies in apparent wound orientation during one interval are best attributed to camera perspective, as all activity and suture handling remain confined to the same central midline incision throughout.
