COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens with the field set around a pink synthetic skin pad marked with three parallel vertical cut lines. Instruments are already laid out: a gold-handled needle driver, Adson-type tissue forceps, and Mayo scissors resting to the left. The operator first comes in to position the needle over the midline mark on the pad, orienting the driver perpendicular to the surface and poised for a right-to-left pass. No skin bite is taken during this brief setup. Almost immediately, work consolidates to the far right incision—an upright linear wound along the pad’s right margin—and remains there for the remainder of the procedure. The central markings and the other unused slit are never penetrated.

Work begins at the inferior end of the rightmost incision. The left hand holds the needle driver, and the right hand uses Adson forceps to pick up and evert the near (right) wound edge. The curved needle is loaded at its proximal third, with the tip oriented to meet the skin at roughly 90 degrees. With the forceps presenting the dermal margin just ahead of the needle tip, the driver advances in a controlled arc through the near edge and across toward the far side. The suture is pulled through to leave a short tail on the operator’s right. The forceps then secure the tail while the driver transitions into instrument ties. Multiple throws are placed, alternating direction to square the knot, and the knot is seated neatly at the inferior end of the slit. The scissors remain idle during this first tying sequence.

With the first stitch secured, the operator proceeds to place the next bite along the same right-hand wound. The hands stay opposed across the incision—driver crossing from the medial side, forceps stationed lateral to the right edge. The right wound lip is lifted to maintain eversion, and the needle again enters at a perpendicular angle, following its curve through uniform tissue depth. The suture is drawn through to set up the next tie, though this pass is not yet secured in that moment. Both hands maintain a tight working corridor, a few millimeters off the surface, keeping the suture complementary to the needle path and free of tangles.

Before the next tie, the operator pauses to optimize needle control. At one point two needle holders are used to reload and pass the needle between hands so that the curve is perfectly aligned for a right-to-left trajectory. The left hand alternates between the driver and, briefly, pickups or a second holder, while the right hand manages the forceps and occasionally the free suture. Tissue manipulation remains minimal during this interlude—no new penetration, just instrument set-up to ensure an accurate subsequent bite. When tying resumes, the needle is parked securely in the right-hand forceps while the left hand performs instrument throws, cinching the previously placed pass and locking a square knot. The wound edges remain approximated; no extra traction is applied, and the needle stays clear of the field during knot security.

With the lower corner now secure and tails trimmed at that site, attention shifts slightly superior along the same incision. The left hand again holds the needle driver, and the right hand uses Adson forceps to evert and steady the right edge. The needle is grasped at the proximal third to midpoint and presented perpendicular to the skin. Using wrist rotation, the driver follows the arc through the near and far lips at matching set-back distances from the margin. The forceps guide the tissue just ahead of the tip, ensuring symmetric bites and consistent depth. The strand is drawn through, then momentarily set aside as the lower knot tails are trimmed cleanly with scissors. The needle is rearmed in the driver with the curve turned toward the next bite path.

Progress continues up the rightmost incision in a steady, methodical pattern. The operator repeatedly reloads the needle as needed to maintain a right-angle approach to the skin. The forceps maintain gentle, precise contact on the dermal edge without crushing, consistently everting the lip for each entry and exit. The driver approaches at roughly 90 degrees to the surface, passes the needle across the incision in a controlled arc, and regrips along the needle body as needed to retrieve and deliver the tip on the far side. Each pass is followed by advancing suture through the tissue and aligning the strand for the next tie. Completed knots along the lower portion remain undisturbed while new stitches are added superiorly in a tidy sequence.

In the middle third of the wound, the pattern remains consistent: small, symmetric bites across the incision, equal distances from the margin, with eversion maintained on both lips. Occasionally the hand dominance switches—at one point the right hand takes over the needle driver while the left controls the forceps—likely to improve ergonomics for a particular angle of approach. Regardless of which hand holds the driver, the needle is always loaded at its proximal third, presented perpendicular to the surface, and advanced primarily with wrist rotation rather than pushing, preserving the needle’s curvature and minimizing tissue trauma. After each pass, the suture is brought through and tensioned just enough to approximate edges without strangulation. Tying is performed with instrument throws that alternate direction to square each knot, with suture tails cut short after securing.

As the work advances toward the upper half of the incision, the same style persists: the driver and forceps oppose one another across the wound, staying close to the line; the unused central slits are left untouched. Between stitches the operator frequently pauses to reload the needle, adjusting grip to keep a true perpendicular approach. When placing bites from the left toward the right lip, the forceps lift and present the right edge; when working the opposite direction, the left edge is similarly supported. The suture strand is intentionally managed—trailing to the operator’s right and superiorly—to avoid snagging the field or encroaching on the next planned bite.

Occasionally, a new suture pack is opened and the needle exchanged, after which the same wound is resumed without any change in technique or target. Throughout, previously secured knots along the lower to mid portions remain undisturbed while the operator fills any gap and continues superiorly. In one segment the camera angle or pad markings momentarily make the wound margin appear curved; nonetheless, the operator’s behavior, instrument relationships, and the location on the pad make it clear the same right-hand vertical incision is being addressed. In another brief sequence, the documentation suggests a “running line,” yet the actions observed—placing a pass, drawing the strand through, tying throws, and cutting tails—remain in keeping with individually secured stitches. Where there is a discrepancy between notes and actions, the on-screen maneuvers retain the same method used before and after: precise, discrete passes across the same wound with knot security between them.

As additional stitches are placed along the mid-to-upper segment, the forceps sometimes move from the near lip to stabilize the far lip as the needle tip emerges, guiding exit direction and depth. The driver often regrips along the needle arc for smoother retrieval, avoiding pulling the needle straight against the tissue. After each pass the suture is pulled through and aligned for tying. When knotting, the needle is parked in the forceps or laid safely to the side, and the driver executes instrument throws. Alternating the direction of the throws squares the knot and prevents slippage. Once seated, tails are trimmed with Mayo scissors, whose activity is limited to trimming; otherwise they sit idle at the left of the field.

Near the end of the sequence, the work zone concentrates on the superior portion of the right incision. A fresh needle-suture is opened to continue, and a new pass is initiated near the top end. The needle is again grasped at the proximal third, tip at 90 degrees to the pad, and the forceps lift the near edge for controlled entry. The driver advances through to the opposite side, and the strand is drawn through. The driver tip stays close to the wound line, moving methodically to the next planned bite. The forceps hold station just lateral to the edge, poised to evert and steady the tissue. This consistent choreography—forceps presenting, driver passing perpendicular, suture managed out of the way—has been maintained from the earliest inferior stitches to the final superior ones.

As the final passes at the top of the wound are completed, the operator tensions the strand to fine-tune approximation and checks each segment for uniform bite spacing and eversion. There is a brief interval of adjustment without new tissue penetration; both driver and forceps perform small manipulations to optimize lay and tension along the previously placed stitches. After this final inspection and minor tightening, the instruments are set down and the field is left undisturbed.

Across the entire procedure, hand positions evolve as needed for access but remain disciplined relative to the wound. Early on, the left hand primarily holds the needle driver with the right hand on forceps at the right edge; later, the right hand occasionally assumes the driver for better ergonomics while the left picks up the tissue or assists with needle handling. Regardless of which hand holds the driver, the approach remains perpendicular, and the arc is respected. The forceps handle the skin edges sparingly, lifting the dermal margin rather than crushing it, to promote consistent edge eversion. Suture management is deliberate: the free strand is kept superiorly and to the operator’s right, clear of the next bite path and away from the scissors during tail trimming.

The technique itself stays consistent from start to finish. Stitches are placed sequentially along the same rightmost vertical incision, beginning inferiorly and advancing superiorly. Each pass is taken with small, symmetric bites at matched distances from the wound edge, the needle advanced by wrist rotation rather than pushing, and the tip guided out of the far lip with controlled regripping. After each pass, the suture is drawn through, the edges are assessed for approximation, and knot tying secures that segment before moving to the next. Where a pass is shown without an immediate tie, a subsequent sequence follows with tying and trimming at that location. At intervals when a new suture is opened, the same line is resumed without deviation.

By the conclusion, the rightmost wound is neatly apposed from its inferior end to its superior end. Multiple individually secured stitches span the length in an orderly row with consistent spacing, bite depth, and eversion. Tails have been cut short, typically on the right side, and no gapping or inversion is visible between knots. The central and left markings remain untouched throughout, except for the initial no-penetration setup near the start. The final check shows the stitch line intact and tensioned appropriately, the instruments withdrawn, and the right-edge incision closed in a controlled, stepwise fashion consistent with the meticulous method demonstrated across the case. Where a frame momentarily suggested an alternate wound geometry or a continuous pattern, the sustained instrument behavior, knotting after passes, and exclusive attention to the same right-edge slit reinforce a single, uninterrupted course of individually secured sutures that progresses from the bottom of the line to the top and concludes with a tidy, evenly approximated closure.
