Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Rubric Assessments:

1) Perpendicular needle passes
Needle was consistently loaded at the proximal third and presented square to the surface, with smooth wrist-driven arcs and matched depth/width across the wound. Passes demonstrated minimal shear and reliable symmetry, supporting accurate edge alignment.

2) Gentle tissue handling
Adsons were used to evert by the dermal margin with light, precise grasps and deliberate avoidance of the epidermal surface; suture was kept clear of the field. Handoffs were controlled with minimal redundant pinches, reflecting atraumatic handling.

3) Square, secure knots
Instrument ties alternated reliably and were seated flat at the midline; tails were trimmed short and consistent. While knots appear secure and properly oriented, the sequence does not clearly surpass standard expectations for security and consistency.

4) Appropriate approximation/tension
Edges were brought together without blanching, with measured, incremental tensioning that avoided strangulation and maintained contour. The final line shows stable approximation without gapping or dog-ears.

5) Even spacing (0.5â€“1.0 cm)
