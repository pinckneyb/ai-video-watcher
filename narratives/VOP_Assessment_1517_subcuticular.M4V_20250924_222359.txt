COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video follows a single linear skin incision across the superior portion of the practice pad as the operator methodically closes it with sequential sutures. From the first frames through the end, the operator advances along the same incision, working from one end toward the other and repeatedly using a coordinated two‑hand technique to present tissue, pass a curved needle, draw the suture through, and secure each bite. The approach is consistent and deliberate: a needle driver in the dominant hand passes a curved, swaged needle in controlled short arcs while the nondominant hand uses fine toothed forceps or fingertips to lift, evert and stabilize the adjacent skin margin and manage the trailing suture.

At the outset the wound is fresh and shallow with slight undermining. The operator positions the hands close to the incision—typically within 1–3 cm—so that the needle driver approaches from above or slightly cranial and the tissue forceps sit lateral or distal to the bite point. The needle is usually grasped near the mid‑shaft to distal third, giving fine control over the tip as it is rotated through dermis in perpendicular-to-oblique passes. Bites are taken with controlled, small arcs: the driver advances the needle tip through the epidermal/dermal layer, the forceps tents and everts the opposing margin to present dermis, and the suture loop is drawn through with minimal tension to approximate edges while avoiding excessive puckering.

As the procedure progresses, sutures are placed in a steady, sequential pattern along the incision. Early passes focus on the proximal/corner end of the wound: the nondominant forceps present the near edge while the driver engages the far edge, then the roles reverse as necessary for retrieval. The operator consistently brings the needle through at approximately right angles to the skin surface, rotating the driver to follow the curved needle’s arc so that each bite takes superficial dermis or dermis with a small superficial subcutaneous purchase when needed to improve edge apposition. The tissue is handled gently with toothed forceps and occasional fingertip stabilization; the operator controls the free suture tail to keep the needle path predictable and to prevent tangling.

Hand and instrument orientation vary slightly with location along the incision but remain functionally consistent. When working at the proximal corner, the driver approaches from above/left and the forceps counter from the right/lower side; as the operator moves medially or laterally along the line the dominant hand sometimes works from above/right or directly dorsal to the wound, but in every case the driver and forceps converge at the stitch point within a very small working envelope. This close spacing—typically a few centimeters or less—facilitates controlled transfer of the needle tip to the forceps and reliable retrieval after the pass. At times the needle is held nearer the tip for fine control when passing through tight corners or shallow dermis; other passes show a mid‑shaft grip that allows confident rotation through the tissue arc.

Depth and purchase vary intentionally according to local tissue characteristics. In segments with some undermining or a small trough the operator takes slightly fuller dermal/subcuticular bites to restore contour, tenting the inferior/adjacent edge and drawing the tissue together to reduce gapping. In other, shallower regions the bites are deliberately superficial to align the epidermal edges with minimal bulk, producing a hairline approximation that reduces puckering. Throughout, slight eversion of the edges is maintained—typical of good epidermal apposition—and tissue trauma is minimized by using atraumatic passes and light counter‑traction.

Knot and loop management is generally performed immediately after each bite. After passing the needle and drawing the suture through, the operator either ties by instrument or, in several sequences, transitions to direct fingertip manipulation. Around the mid‑procedure there is a clear shift in handling: while the needle passes continue in the conventional instrument‑assisted manner, some frames show the operator using gloved fingertips to form loops and complete throws, applying direct fingertip pressure to oppose the wound and maintain even tension during knot formation. This hand‑tying moment allows more tactile feedback for knot security and fine tension control. Most of the time, however, knot formation follows the standard pattern—suture tails are managed by one hand while the other readies the next pass.

Spatial relationships evolve in small, predictable ways as the operator moves from one end of the incision to the other. Initially, the needle driver dominates the superior/central position above the wound and the forceps grips the lateral/near edge. As stitches are placed sequentially, the two hands migrate along the incision, the driver pivoting to maintain an optimal trajectory for the curved needle and the forceps repositioning to present fresh tissue. Instrument tips remain within a few centimeters of one another, alternating between crossing over the incision and working side‑by‑side, depending on the bite angle required at each point. When working on concave or curved portions of the incision, the driver often approaches more vertically to the skin surface and the forceps come in more laterally to retrieve the needle tip cleanly.

Technique remains largely consistent throughout: interrupted, through‑and‑through dermal bites with careful approximation and slight eversion. The needle is repeatedly grasped at the midshaft or slightly distal for precise control, and the operator employs short, controlled rotations to pass the tip through dermis toward the forceps. Where extra apposition is required—such as across small gaps or undermined troughs—slightly deeper dermal or superficial subcutaneous purchase is taken to re‑contour the line before reducing tension and tying. The operator pays attention to avoiding overly deep fascial bites, focusing on epidermal alignment.

There are a few moments that depart from textbook instrument technique. In one mid‑sequence set of frames the operator appears to switch to manual knot‑tying and loop formation by fingertip rather than instrument knotting; this produces faster knot security and more nuanced tensioning but briefly alters the two‑instrument choreography. Later, toward the end of the recording, there is a short interval in which a handheld instrument holds and advances the needle while an opposing hand is not present in the frame—this single‑handed pass is transient and is followed by the usual two‑handed stabilization in subsequent bites. These deviations do not interrupt the overall continuity of the closure but are worth noting as technique variability within an otherwise controlled approach.

Needle retrieval is handled predictably: once the needle tip exits, the forceps grasps and draws it through while the driver releases and repositions for the next pass. Suture tails are managed to avoid crossing the field, often held by the nondominant hand or looped away from the incision surface so they do not interfere with the next needle entry. Hands frequently stabilize by resting fingertips on the pad surface to create a steady fulcrum, especially when fine rotational control of the driver is needed. As the operator proceeds along the line, the choreography becomes rhythmical: present tissue, pass needle, retrieve, tension and tie, adjust tail, move to the next site.

Toward the later portion of the video, the operator works on more central and distal sections of the incision. The same principles apply: small, controlled needle arcs, careful everting of the edges, and close instrument convergence. On stretches where prior interrupted sutures already lie distally, the operator places additional stitches just proximal to that row to continue closing the wound in a continuous sequence of interrupted closures. The final passes mirror the initial technique but also show increased reliance on fingertip handling for loop formation and tight, low‑profile knotting to minimize tissue puckering as the line becomes more completely approximated.

In the very last frames the operator completes a pass but then withdraws the instrument and hand from the scene; the suture tail remains visible across the pad. Overall the wound is uniformly approximated along its length, with epidermal margins closely opposed and a slight, intentional eversion maintained to promote edge‑to‑edge contact. The closure shows consistent bites oriented to restore contour where undermining existed, and the series of interrupted sutures forms a neat, continuous line of apposition without gross gapping or excessive tension. Minimal surface puckering is noted in a few areas—expected when securing a series of interrupted knots—but the operator’s attentiveness to bite depth and knot tension mitigates persistent deformity.

Throughout the procedure the operator demonstrates deliberate, coordinated hand movements and an adaptive use of instruments: the needle driver provides controlled needle trajectory while the forceps and fingertips offer precise tissue presentation and suture management. Depth of purchase varies in response to local tissue needs—generally superficial dermal with occasional superficial subcutaneous bites for reinforcement—yielding a final closure that balances edge eversion, minimal bulk, and secure knot placement. A brief deviation to more manual loop‑tying and a fleeting single‑handed needle pass are observed, but they do not alter the overall methodical progression from one end of the incision to the other. The final state is a neatly approximated incision, closed with sequentially placed, well‑tensioned sutures that restore surface continuity and maintain appropriate edge alignment for healing.
