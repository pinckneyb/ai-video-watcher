COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a right‑sided vertical skin incision in the upper quadrant of the practice pad — a short, linear slit approximately 2–4 cm long and oriented cranio‑caudally. From the first frames the clinician is working along that same line: a column of previously placed, evenly spaced interrupted sutures is visible adjacent to the open portion of the wound, and the operator methodically fills the remaining gap by adding additional interrupted stitches until the incision is fully approximated and secured.

Opening and exposure
At the outset the operator approaches from the right side of the pad with both hands gloved and instruments in a conventional pairing: a needle driver in the dominant hand and fine toothed tissue forceps in the nondominant hand. The wound edges are elevated slightly with the forceps to present the epidermal/dermal margins. The needle is a curved surgical needle attached to black suture; it is consistently grasped in the driver at a mid‑to‑proximal shaft position rather than exclusively at the swage or the very tip. The surgeon uses short, wrist‑driven arcs to rotate the needle through tissue, aiming for perpendicular bites across the wound margins.

Sequential stitch placement
Throughout the video the clinician continues a pattern of placing interrupted stitches in series along the same vertical incision. The pattern is iterative and methodical: the nondominant hand lifts and everts the near edge with fine forceps, creating a small tent of tissue; the needle driver then passes the curved needle through the opposite edge and returns through the near edge to create a symmetric bite. Suture material is pulled through until an appropriate loop remains for tying. This sequence is repeated, each time moving position slightly along the wound to maintain consistent spacing and equivalent bite depth.

Needle handling and bite geometry remain consistent: the needle trajectory is generally perpendicular to the wound edge to capture epidermis and dermis layers (simulated full‑thickness dermal bites on the pad), with the tip entering and exiting near the epidermal margin to produce slight eversion when the stitch is tensioned. The grips and hand mechanics vary subtly by frame, but several recurring elements are apparent: the needle is most commonly held midshaft or near the hub in the driver, the driver rotates through short controlled arcs, and the forceps present the tissue at the intended exit point. When receiving the needle, the forceps or opposing instrument is positioned to cradle the tip as it exits, minimizing uncontrolled movement and maintaining precise placement.

Hand and instrument choreography
Hands remain close to the wound throughout, typically within a few centimeters of each other, enabling fine control. In many sequences the right hand (dominant) manipulates the needle with the driver while the left hand controls tissue with atraumatic or toothed forceps; in other brief moments the handedness is reversed, with a left‑handed driver and right‑handed forceps, but the relative relationship — one hand driving the needle, the other presenting the edge — is constant. Instruments are brought from lateral and superior approaches depending on stitch location, but tips converge at the bite site and cross over the incision plane when passing the needle. The clinician occasionally uses a straight needle driver, curved hemostat‑style instrument, or a ring‑handled needle holder; scissors appear intermittently when trimming suture tails after knot tying.

Tissue handling and bite depth
The simulated skin is handled atraumatically: bites are small and even, engaging epidermal and superficial dermal layers. The forceps elevate and evert the edge to ensure epidermal apposition when the knot is tightened. There is minimal puckering or tension on surrounding tissue, indicating controlled suture tension and consistent bite depth. When sutures are secured, the knots sit distal to the next working point and maintain slight eversion of the margin, a sign of appropriate bite placement aimed at good cosmetic approximation.

Knot tying and suture management
After each needle pass the operator draws the suture through, positions the loop, and secures it with knot throws. In several frames the clinician ties using instruments (needle drivers and forceps) while in others the operator supplements or completes ties digitally, holding suture tails between thumb and forefinger to tension and dress the knot. After securing knots, tails are trimmed with scissors in a few sequences; in other instances the tails are managed with hemostat‑style clamps and held laterally while subsequent stitches are placed. This alternation of instrument and digital knot‑management reflects efficient workflow: pass the needle, draw the suture through, tie and trim, then move to the next adjacent bite.

Progression along the incision
The work progresses predictably from one end of the incision to the other. Early frames show several sutures already completed toward the distal portion and the operator actively placing new stitches at the proximal/superior gap. Over time the sequence shows the clinician moving along the open length, inserting additional interrupted stitches medially and superiorly as necessary to fill the remaining open gaps between previously tied knots. The operator consistently spaces the sutures evenly and maintains alignment so the completed line of stitches forms a straight column adjacent to the incision.

Variations and occasional inconsistencies
Across the recording, technique is largely consistent with interrupted suture placement, yet a few frames contain demonstrations that differ slightly. In isolated sequences the clinician’s hands manipulate a length of suture across the superior portion of the wound in a way that visually resembles advancement or tensioning of a continuous strand rather than a discrete interrupted throw. In other brief moments the operator’s hands are directly over the wound performing knot tensioning without fresh needle passage, or only a single instrument (forceps/scissors) enters from the top of the frame. These episodes are short and appear to represent knot tying, trimming, or suture management rather than a change in the overall closure strategy. They are noted as deviations in visual pattern, but the intended procedural approach remains the placement of sequential interrupted sutures.

Instrument specifics and grip nuances
Needle grips vary slightly depending on the pass and approach angle: the driver sometimes holds the needle at its mid‑arc, sometimes closer to the swage, and occasionally near the tip for added control when passing through stiff simulated tissue. The approaches to the wound also vary: drivers approach from lateral, medial, superior, or slightly oblique angles to facilitate perpendicular bites; the non‑driving hand adapts accordingly, either receiving the needle and guiding its exit or holding tissue with the tip of Adson‑type forceps. When forceps are used to receive the needle, they are oriented so the jaws present a minimal profile and protect the tissue as the tip exits.

Coordination and safety gestures
The operator maintains close instrument control and consistent two‑hand coordination. When the needle exits, the instrument tips are adjacent to one another to shield the nearby tissue and allow immediate transfer or repositioning. Finger pressure and fingertip stabilization are used intermittently to compress and align the wound margins, especially during final knot placement. Scissors are introduced sparingly to trim tails; otherwise the workspace is kept clear, allowing unobstructed visualization of the incision line.

Final refinement and completion
As the series of interrupted stitches nears completion, the clinician performs final tightening and dressing maneuvers at the most superior portion of the incision. Fingers and forceps compress the edges while suture tails are oriented and trimmed. In the final frames an instrument—often a pair of scissors or a fine forceps—approaches the superior end where the last knot has been set; sometimes only a single instrument is visible as the operator finishes dressing the sutures. The completed row of sutures is even and parallel to the incision, with consistent spacing and slight eversion of the wound margins preserved by tight, well‑seated knots.

Final wound appearance
At the conclusion the incision is fully approximated along its entire visible length, with the series of interrupted sutures maintaining edge apposition and gentle eversion. Knots are secure and tails have been managed; there is minimal gapping between bites and little to no surrounding tissue distortion. The final scene shows the wound closed to an appropriate cosmetic and functional standard on the synthetic skin pad, with the suture line tidy and evenly spaced.

Summary assessment
From start to finish the clinician carries out an orderly sequence of interrupted sutures along a single right‑sided vertical incision. Needle handling, bite geometry, and tissue apposition are consistent and controlled: curved needles are held at mid‑shaft and advanced in short arcs; the opposing edge is lifted and everted with fine forceps; knots are tied and tails trimmed; and the stitch spacing is uniform. Minor brief episodes resemble continuous strand manipulation or focused knot dressing, but they do not materially alter the overall interrupted‑suture strategy carried out for closure. The procedure concludes with a neatly approximated incision, secure knots, and preserved edge eversion, reflecting a standard interrupted closure applied methodically along the entire wound.
