Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your hand mechanics are fundamentally sound: you respect the needleâ€™s arc, present near perpendicular, and use the Adsons to evert rather than crush. Instrument spacing was controlled and you consistently let the needle driver, not your wrist, do the work. The single completed stitch shows acceptable approximation and eversion.
