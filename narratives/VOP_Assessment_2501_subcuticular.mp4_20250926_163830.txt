COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents the progressive closure of a single vertical skin incision on the right side of the practice pad using a sequential interrupted suture technique. From the opening frames through the end of the recording, the operator consistently returns to the same right‑third incision and works along its open length, placing additional bites and tying them into a continuous, evenly spaced line of interrupted knots that ultimately approximates the wound edges. Below is a chronological, integrated narrative of the work, describing how each pass, instrument movement and tissue handling contributes to the gradual, methodical closure.

Initial approach and early passes (0–60 s)
The video opens with the rightmost vertical incision already partially closed: several interrupted sutures lie inferiorly and the operator is working on the remaining open segment superior to them. From the outset both hands are gloved and coordinated close to the skin surface, typically 1–3 cm from the wound margin. The dominant hand grips a needle driver while the non‑dominant hand controls fine toothed forceps (Adson‑type) or directly manipulates tissue with fingertips. The curved, swaged needle is consistently grasped in the driver roughly at or near the mid‑shaft or slightly more proximal depending on the pass, and the driver is moved in short, controlled arcs.

At each pass the forceps lifts and everts the near wound edge to expose the dermal margin; the needle is driven through the opposing edge at a shallow angle so that bites capture the superficial-to-mid dermal layer of the synthetic pad. The operator aims for relatively small, evenly spaced bites placed a few millimeters from the epidermal margin to achieve slight eversion when the stitch is tensioned. After needle passage the suture is pulled through and managed by the assisting hand or fingertip to prepare for knot‑tying. These early sequences establish the rhythm—pass the needle through one side, capture the opposite side, draw the suture through, and ready the loop for tying.

Progressing along the incision (60–150 s)
Work continues cranially along the same right‑side incision. The needle driver and forceps alternate which side they approach from; most frames show the driver taking the needle from the lateral side and the forceps stabilizing and everting the medial edge, though the relative lateral/medial orientation varies slightly with operator positioning. Instruments often cross briefly over the incision as the needle is advanced and extracted. Needle grips are varied but deliberate: sometimes the driver holds nearer the swage for a more controlled arc, sometimes at midshaft for finer directional control; occasional repositioning of the needle in the jaws is visible to reorient the curvature and ensure the tip exits at the planned point on the far edge.

The operator consistently uses light traction and fingertip control to bring edges into apposition without overt tension. Completed interrupted knots below the working area act as a reference line; new stitches are placed adjacent and slightly superior, extending the row methodically. Between passes the non‑dominant hand will occasionally manage suture tails, lessen slack, and maintain alignment of previously placed material so that when a new knot is tied it seats flush with neighbors.

Mid‑procedure variations and instrument interchange (150–240 s)
As the procedure progresses, hand positions and instrument roles show small but meaningful adaptations. The instrument approach alternates: sometimes the needle driver comes from the top/right and forceps from the bottom/left; other times the driver is on the left lateral aspect and the forceps medial. The spacing between instruments remains tight (generally 1–4 cm), enabling precise control during needle transfer and bite placement.

Several frames document short periods where the operator pauses active needle insertion to tension and arrange earlier knots. In these intervals, one hand manipulates the suture loops while the other holds the knot in position or prepares for the next throw. On one occasion a frame set shows no needle present and activity limited to adjusting and arranging tied suture tails—this is the expected stage between cycles of passing and tying. Throughout, the goal is consistent: create small, dermally anchored bites with slight eversion for optimal edge apposition and healing.

Single‑handed fingertip technique and localized adaptations (240–360 s)
Midway through the recording the operator intermittently employs a more tactile approach for brief segments. In one set of frames the needle is held between fingertips rather than in the needle driver; the left hand is out of frame and the working hand guides the needle tip directly to the skin. This palmar/fingertip grasp is used sparingly and typically when passing the needle in very tight superior areas where instrument access is limited. Despite this variation, the same basic movement—lift/evert with the opposing hand, pass the needle in a controlled arc, pull the suture through and prepare for knotting—remains.

There is also an instance where the recorded imagery suggests the presence of a continuous loop of suture being drawn along the incision, but the broader sequence and the majority of frames show repetitive, discrete passes consistent with individual interrupted stitches. Because the technique used for the remainder of the procedure is a methodical placement of separate bites and subsequent knotting, the operator appears to maintain the interrupted pattern as the primary approach; the momentary appearance of continuity likely represents transient handling of a looped tail between passes rather than a deliberate running closure.

Late passes and knot management (360–405 s)
Approaching the final third of the recording, the operator concentrates on placing the superiormost stitches and finishing the row so the entire wound is closed. Needle handling returns to the familiar pattern: the driver is used to advance the curved needle through the lateral edge, the forceps evert and stabilize the medial edge, and the suture is pulled through until loops are ready to be tied. Tie‑downs are done with instruments working close over the incision; one instrument commonly lies almost parallel to the wound while the other manipulates the suture to form secure square knots.

Throughout these finishing stages the operator frequently repositions prior knots and adjusts suture tails so knots sit neatly along the margin with consistent eversion. Slight variations in bite depth—some passes take a more superficial epidermal/subcutaneous bite, others engage a little deeper dermis—are corrected during tightening so that the final line is uniformly approximated.

Spatial choreography and hand evolution over the case
Across all frames the hands and instruments choreograph tightly around the incision: they flank the wound, approach from opposing sides, and cross over it at shallow angles. Early on the dominant hand’s needle driver is often positioned slightly above or lateral relative to the wound, with the non‑dominant hand providing medial or inferior stabilization. As the operator progresses along the length of the incision their body and hand positions subtly shift cranially or caudally in step, so that instrument approach angles change to preserve optimal needle trajectory and visibility.

The non‑dominant hand’s role evolves from basic tissue eversion and suture tail handling to also supporting final knot tension and adjustment as stitches accumulate. At times the non‑dominant hand temporarily becomes the needle‑manipulating hand (either by switching instruments or by using fingertip control) in order to achieve the precise exit point for a shallow superior bite. Throughout the case, instrument separation remains compact (roughly 1–4 cm), emphasizing precise coordination and small, controlled movements rather than broad sweeping motions.

Consistency and refinement of technique
Overall the operator maintains a consistent technique: deliberate, controlled needle arcs, small dermal bites, eversion of edges with toothed forceps or fingertips, and secure knot tying producing a neat interrupted line. Small refinements occur as the procedure proceeds—needle grip is adjusted to improve exit angle, the operator repositions hands to accommodate tighter spaces near the superior end, and shorter, crisper bites are favored as the line is completed to avoid puckering. Where a frame briefly suggests a different suture pattern, the subsequent and preceding frames return to the interrupted pattern, confirming that the interrupted stitch sequence is the planned and executed technique.

Final configuration and wound appearance (final frames)
By the end of the recording the entire length of the right‑third incision is closed with a sequence of evenly spaced interrupted sutures that bring the epidermal margins into close apposition with a consistent, slight eversion at each stitch. The knots lie adjacent to the wound edge and suture tails have been managed and arranged so they do not create excessive bulk or tension. Manipulations in the final frames show instrument ties being tightened and small adjustments being made to ensure that adjacent knots sit evenly and that the tissue is not over‑compressed.

There is very little residual gapping: any small gaps present during needle passage are eliminated as the stitches are seated and knotted. No excessive tension lines or tissue strangulation are visible; the operator’s use of small bites and careful eversion has produced a closure that is functionally sound and cosmetically consistent for a simulated pad model. Final frames capture the operator arranging the suture tails and tensioning the last knots, signaling completion of the row of discrete interrupted stitches along the right side incision.

Summary
From the outset to the finish, the procedure documents a careful, methodical closure of the right‑third vertical incision using an interrupted suture approach. Needle handling is precise—grasped near mid‑shaft or swage as required, rotated through controlled arcs—while the opposing forceps or fingertip elevation of the near edge consistently provides eversion and clear visualization. Hand positions adapt to the working segment of the incision but remain close and coordinated throughout. Occasional brief deviations in grip or a transient appearance of a looped suture line are present, but the prevailing pattern is the sequential placement and secure tying of individual interrupted stitches, resulting in an intact, appropriately everted, and evenly approximated wound closure along the right‑side incision.
