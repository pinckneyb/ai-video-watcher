COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a three‑incision training pad: a central vertical wound that already carries several simple interrupted sutures, a right‑sided vertical incision with a row of interrupted stitches, and a long, gaping left vertical slit that is still untreated. Throughout the session the operator’s primary repair is the right vertical incision, which already shows four neatly spaced interrupted stitches; the surgeon repeatedly sets up to add another stitch toward the distal end, returns intermittently to tension and trim an existing knot, and later re‑approaches the top for a further pass. In between, the operator demonstrates first‑bite technique on the separate, unsutured left slit without tying any knot on that line. By the end of the sequence, the right incision still shows four completed interrupted sutures with the needle poised for another pass; no additional stitches have been tied on that line during the captured intervals.

Early housekeeping and orientation (0.0–14.0 s)
The session begins with housekeeping at the inferior end of the central wound, which already has four simple interrupted sutures approximating its edges. The dominant hand alternates Adson forceps and scissors/needle holder just below the wound, while the nondominant hand steadies the tissue at the inferior corner. The operator briefly lifts the central wound edges to assess approximation, and trims a suture tail at the most inferior stitch. Although a curved needle appears near the inferior end, no fresh pass is driven; this is maintenance rather than active placement. The left slit remains untouched and gaping, and the right incision is not handled during this initial housekeeping.

First approach to the primary repair on the right incision (15.0–59.0 s)
The operator then moves to the right‑side vertical incision, which already carries a row of simple interrupted sutures from the top toward midline. Four completed stitches are visible along this incision; the inferior segment is still open and is clearly the next target.

At 15.0–29.0 s, the right hand intermittently introduces Adson forceps from the right‑lower and right‑upper quadrants to tent the right wound edge, then switches to a needle driver. The left hand appears on the left side of the field, occasionally holding scissors or a driver but without manipulating other incisions. A curved needle with attached monofilament is brought to the lower third of the right incision and clamped at roughly the proximal/middle third of its curve, with the needle arc oriented to pass from the right wound edge toward midline. The forceps tent the near edge to present a purchase point, while the needle holder stays perpendicular to the skin to set up a clean, perpendicular entry. No tissue penetration is completed during this interval; the maneuver is all about presentation, spacing, and angle control for a standard simple interrupted bite.

From 30.0–44.0 s, the right incision remains the focus. The right hand holds the needle driver and occasionally scissors, hovering over the lower half of the incision, while the left hand intermittently applies forceps or a driver at the left edge of the wound. The curved needle is again grasped at the proximal‑to‑middle third, tip aimed toward the left wound edge at the lower end, positioning for the next pass. The existing sutures keep the wound everted and aligned; no throw is placed and no new pass is completed. Four finished sutures remain visible along the line.

By 45.0–59.0 s, the operator continues to work at the inferior end of this same incision. The left hand alternates between a needle holder and forceps above the field, while the right hand uses Adson forceps with precision, even controlling the needle tip to fine‑tune its position. The needle is held with the driver at the proximal third, jaws perpendicular to the curve, and oriented for a right‑to‑left pass at the caudal gap. Despite careful repositioning and opposing traction lines—needle holder superior‑left to the incision, forceps inferior‑right—no penetration is made. The edges remain nicely everted by the existing stitches, the target site is the lowest open gap, and the count along the right incision remains four completed stitches.

Demonstration of first bites on the unsutured left slit (60.0–179.0 s)
Next the operator turns to the long, gaping slit at the far left of the pad as a separate exercise in first‑bite technique. This left wound, which has no sutures at any time during these segments, is used repeatedly to demonstrate entry, eversion, and controlled needle travel without tying. These interludes do not alter the primary right‑side repair.

At 60.0–74.0 s, attention centers on the inferior end of the left slit. The right hand holds Adson forceps on the lower‑left dermal edge, everting it to expose the dermis. The left hand brings a needle driver in, the needle grasped two‑thirds from its tip and oriented perpendicular to the pad. The tip is brought to the inferior corner for a lateral‑to‑medial entry and then withdrawn. No pass is completed.

At 75.0–89.0 s, the left hand (with the driver) approaches from the left side; the right hand (forceps) everts the lower‑right lip. The driver advances the needle through the far (left) wound edge at the lower end toward the near side, consistent with a simple interrupted placement. Eversion is maintained; no knot is tied.

From 90.0–104.0 s, the demonstration shifts to the superior portion of the left slit. The left hand holds the driver while the right hand grasps the left wound edge near the superior corner with forceps, tenting it to expose dermis/subcutis. The curved needle, secured at the proximal third, is oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin and aligned for an outside‑in entry on the left edge at approximately a right angle. No crossing to the far edge or tying occurs.

At 105.0–119.0 s, this pattern continues. The driver grasps the needle mid‑shaft, tip perpendicular to skin, aiming from the left lip toward the right. The forceps remain just below the needle tip, stabilizing and everting the left wound edge a few millimeters from the margin. A bite is initiated but not completed across.

From 120.0–134.0 s, the left hand holds toothed forceps on the near (left) edge while the right hand manipulates the driver. The curved needle is advanced into the near edge at the lower half of the slit, then withdrawn and repositioned. Again, no completed stitch is tied.

At 135.0–149.0 s, the driver approaches from the lateral left and the forceps from the right, converging at the superior corner. The tip advances from external to internal on the left edge while the forceps maintain eversion and alignment. No tying is performed.

From 150.0–164.0 s and 165.0–179.0 s, the same left‑edge technique is reiterated at the top of the slit: the right hand everts the superior edge, the left hand advances the needle in a controlled arc, and the needle is pulled through with alternating control. Bites remain close to the margin for accuracy and eversion, yet none of these demonstrations include a knot.

Consolidating the first pass at the top of the left slit (180.0–224.0 s)
The next three segments refine and then execute a full pass at the superior end of the left slit, still without knot tying.

At 180.0–194.0 s, the left hand holds the driver just lateral to the wound apex while the right hand (forceps) grasps the epidermal edge to evert. The needle is clamped two‑thirds from the tip, advanced forehand perpendicular to the pad, and entered at the epidermal‑dermal junction on the left lip. This is the start of a new stitch.

At 195.0–209.0 s, the driver, grasping the needle at the proximal third, advances the tip from the lateral skin toward and then across the wound apex, while the right hand elevates the dermal edge to maximize eversion. The pass is made across, but there is no tying, and thus no completed stitch is created on this left incision.

From 210.0–224.0 s, the driver approaches from the upper left and the forceps hold just inside/medial to the entry point, guiding the perpendicular needle trajectory. The needle engages the top left edge to begin the first pass; again, nothing is tied. By the end of these frames, the left slit still has zero completed sutures.

Returning to the primary repair: securing and preparing on the right incision (225.0–254.0 s)
The operator refocuses on the right‑side vertical incision. Four completed interrupted sutures remain visible along its length, with mild puckering around each knot indicating tissue approximation.

Between 225.0–239.0 s, the left hand alternates between a needle holder and scissors stationed superior to the incision, while the right hand uses Adson forceps just lateral to the right edge. Early frames show the needle held two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the pad, but the activity centers on knot handling and trimming of an already‑placed stitch rather than placing a new bite. The forceps grasp the near edge to stabilize and create slight tension while the operator tightens and trims, maintaining a few millimeters of working distance from the wound line. No new pass is made; the count along the right incision remains four.

From 240.0–254.0 s, the left hand holds the needle driver left–superior to the pad, orienting toward the distal end of the right incision, while the right hand’s forceps are at the distal corner. The needle is clamped two‑thirds from the tip and oriented for a right‑to‑left pass at the distal gap. The forceps lift and evert the far dermal edge to expose an entry site. Despite this crisp setup, no needle penetration occurs in these frames. The wound remains nicely approximated by the four existing interrupted sutures.

Completing a pass on the left but not tying (255.0–269.0 s)
The operator again demonstrates passage on the left slit. The left hand works from the far (left) side of the wound with the driver; the right hand opposes it on the near (right) edge with forceps, and later tension is applied to the strand with scissors appearing briefly for trimming. The needle is advanced from the far left edge toward the near right edge at the superior end, and the strand is drawn through as in a standard simple interrupted placement. Even here, no knot is tied within these frames, so the left wound still records zero completed stitches.

Final positioning at the top of the primary repair (270.0 s)
The session closes back on the right‑side incision. One hand is visible at the top right of the frame above the superior end of this wound, holding a curved needle with attached suture poised above the skin, oriented to approach the surface. The needle has not yet engaged tissue. Along the right incision, four completed simple interrupted sutures are clearly visible; the edges are approximated and slightly everted by the existing row. No instrument is on tissue at this instant, and no crossing or tensioning of strands is occurring—this is a moment of setup to place the next stitch near the top of the incision.

Technique and instrument handling across the session
Across all right‑incision segments, the operator maintains the hallmarks of sound simple interrupted technique:
- Needle control: The needle is consistently grasped about two‑thirds from the tip (or at the proximal third), with the driver’s jaws perpendicular to the needle’s curve to preserve curvature and prevent skiving. The intended trajectory is nearly 90 degrees to the skin surface to favor symmetric bites.
- Tissue handling: Adson forceps are used to gently evert and stabilize the dermal edge without crushing. The forceps often lift the near edge when targeting an outside‑in bite and are positioned just inside/medial to the entry site to guide perpendicular passage.
- Spatial coordination: Hands oppose each other across the incision to create balanced traction lines—driver lateral/superior, forceps medial/inferior—so the needle can be advanced in a smooth arc while the forceps expose the dermis.
- Sequence discipline: The operator identifies the lowest open gap at the distal end for the next stitch, then also sets up at the superior end late in the session. Although no new stitch is completed in the captured intervals, the planning, alignment, and knot handling sequences underscore consistent technique.

On the left slit, the repeated first‑bite demonstrations reinforce similar principles: perpendicular entry a few millimeters from the edge, eversion with toothed forceps, and controlled arc travel. Several passes are initiated or fully carried through, and on two occasions the needle is drawn through the wound, but none is tied; consequently, no sutures are completed on the left slit during the observed periods.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
- Early (right incision, lower third): The right hand alternates between forceps and driver at the lower end, while the left hand assists above the field. The driver typically stands superior‑lateral to the entry, the forceps inferior‑medial, creating opposing vectors to seat the bite.
- Mid‑sequence (left slit demonstrations): The driver most often sits lateral/left of the slit while forceps oppose from the right, converging at either the inferior corner or the superior apex, depending on the demonstration. The driver advances the needle while the forceps maintain eversion; control is alternated when pulling the needle through.
- Late (right incision, distal then proximal): The driver returns left–superior to the distal end, then the operator later repositions to the top of the incision, with the visible hand holding the needle above the superior end. Forceps position medial to the entry site when knot handling; when preparing a bite, the forceps evert the edge to present the dermis.

Progression and suture count tracking on the primary repair
- Initial view of the right incision (15.0–59.0 s): Four completed simple interrupted sutures are present. The operator repeatedly prepares for another bite at the distal end but does not pass the needle through tissue.
- Interludes on the left slit (60.0–224.0 s): No activity occurs on the right incision; its count remains four. On the left slit, multiple first‑bite attempts and one full pass are demonstrated, but none is tied.
- Return to the right incision for knot work and preparation (225.0–254.0 s): The operator tensions and trims an existing stitch and sets up for another bite; the count remains four completed sutures.
- Demonstration pass on the left slit (255.0–269.0 s): Again, no change to the right incision; the left slit continues to show zero tied sutures.
- Final frame on the right incision (270.0 s): Four completed interrupted sutures are visible; the needle is poised over the superior end to begin a new pass.

Final state and mandatory count verification
At the end of the procedure, the right‑side vertical incision—the line being actively managed throughout this session—shows exactly four completed simple interrupted sutures. The edges are approximated with mild eversion at each bite. Despite multiple preparations at the distal and then proximal ends for another stitch, no additional pass is completed and tied within the captured frames. Therefore:
- Total completed sutures visible at the end: 4.
- Count progression on the primary repair: 4 at first appearance, 4 during mid‑session knot handling and preparation, and 4 at the final frame; no increase occurs.
- The left slit, used for demonstration of first bites and one full pass without tying, retains zero completed sutures throughout.

In summary, the operator maintains a consistent simple interrupted technique on the right vertical incision, with careful needle orientation, stable eversion using Adsons, and meticulous knot handling and trimming of an existing stitch. The surgeon repeatedly sets up for additional stitches—first at the distal gap and later at the superior end—but no new stitch is tied on that line in the observed segments, leaving four completed interrupted sutures visible in the final frame. The separate demonstrations on the left slit highlight first‑bite mechanics and controlled needle passage without altering the completed suture count on the primary repair.
