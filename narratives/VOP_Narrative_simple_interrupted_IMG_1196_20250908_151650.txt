COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on the central, short vertical incision. With the pad stabilized, the right hand brings in the needle driver and the left hand takes Adson forceps on the left wound edge. The needle is held about two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the skin. A first simple interrupted bite is taken across the inferior half of the cut: the left hand everts the near edge, the needle enters a few millimeters from the right margin and follows its curve to exit symmetrically on the left. The suture is drawn through and the driver is repurposed for instrument ties. Hands straddle the gap—the driver hovering just to the right/superior of the slit while the left hand controls the tail—alternating square throws to seat the knot directly over the wound. The throws are completed and the first stitch is secured.

Work remains centered over this same short incision as additional throws are laid to lock the knot. The right hand uses the driver as a post while the left hand alternately tensions the standing and free ends, coapting the edges purely with suture traction. Scissors then come in from the right, and with the left hand presenting the tails, the knot is trimmed flush. One interrupted stitch now spans the inferior portion of the incision.

Attention moves a bit superior along this same line. The right hand again loads the needle two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the surface. The left hand returns with Adsons to evert the left lip. A second simple interrupted pass is placed—right edge first, then retrieved across to the left under forceps control—following the needle’s arc. The strand is pulled through and instrument ties are initiated. Forceps are set aside; the right hand, just right/superior to the slit, forms loops and alternates throws while the left hand, left/inferior to the wound, manages the short tail. The knot is tightened down centrally over the incision, leaving two stitches in place.

With two stitches bridging the gap, the operator reinforces the center knot with additional alternating throws. The needle is then reloaded in the driver, proximal third held, curve oriented perpendicular and the tip aimed toward the next target point. The left hand reintroduces forceps to stabilize the tissue for the next placement.

A third simple interrupted stitch is then created on the same incision, slightly more superior. The needle—still grasped near the swage end for control—has already traversed both edges and exits at the left side as the sequence of instrument ties begins. The driver (superior‑right) alternates grasping the long strand and the short tail to place opposite‑direction throws; the left hand keeps the knot centered and edges everted. No cutting yet—just secure, deliberate cinching that brings the skin edges together with slight eversion. By now, three simple interrupted sutures are aligned along the short central slit.

The next moments are devoted to finishing work: additional locking throws are placed on the latest stitch without taking new bites, maintaining even tension so the wound doesn’t gape. Hands cross over the incision during each throw, then separate to set the knot down squarely. The instruments briefly withdraw; when they return, the left hand uses forceps to steady the inferior end while the right hand brings scissors to trim tails on the lowest knot. With the inferior stitch cleaned up, a fresh needle is loaded in the driver—held at the proximal third and oriented for a perpendicular entry—positioned for the next pass up the line.

The final placement occurs at the superior end of this same central incision. The right hand, slightly superior‑right of the wound, drives the needle (grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the pad) through the left wound edge first, rotates through, and retrieves across to the opposite edge while the left hand, now with forceps on the left lip, maintains eversion and stability. The strand is pulled through and instrument ties are begun with the driver holding the short end over the wound while the opposite hand manages the long end. Successive throws are laid with the instruments crossing and separating over the topmost stitch, keeping the knot centered at the superior position. This top stitch is tightened and finished with multiple alternating throws.

To conclude, the left hand stabilizes the strand just above the superior knot while the right hand brings in scissors from the right. The tips are placed adjacent to the knot and the tails are trimmed. The instruments withdraw, revealing a neat row of four simple interrupted sutures running from inferior to superior along the central short incision. Throughout, the longer vertical slit on the right and any other pad cuts remain untouched. The technique remains consistent: needle held near the proximal or mid‑body for control, entries at 90 degrees with the curve followed through the tissue, edges gently everted with forceps during placement, and square instrument ties centered over each bite, with scissors used only after knots are fully secured. Hands and instruments repeatedly straddle the incision, working in a right‑to‑left rhythm for placement and crossing over the line for tying, progressing steadily up the wound until closure is complete.
