Pattern: Vertical Mattress

RUBRIC ASSESSMENT

1) Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes
- Passes are perpendicular and smooth, but each stitch is executed as a simple interrupted without the defining far-far then near-near sequence of a vertical mattress. The lack of layered deep and superficial bites is a core error for this technique. Score: 1

2) Gentle tissue handling
- Adsons are used with deliberate, light grasps to evert and stabilize without crushing, and the left hand often switches to fingers for suture control instead of repeated tissue grabs. Tissue contact is precise and minimized. Score: 4

3) Square, secure knots
- Instrument ties use alternating, opposing throws that seat flat in the midline, with controlled tension and tidy tail trimming. Knots remain consistently square and secure across stitches. Score: 4

4) Balanced tension deep vs superficial
- With no far-far/near-near layering, all tension resides in a single plane rather than being distributed deep-to-superficial. This omits the vertical mattress’s deep support and fails the requirement for balanced tension. Score: 1

5) Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm)
