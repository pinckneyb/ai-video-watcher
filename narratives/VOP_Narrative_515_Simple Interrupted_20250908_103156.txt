COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
From the opening moments, the sequence reads like a careful, methodical lesson in simple interrupted skin suturing on a synthetic pad. The field is centered on the middle incision, and the right hand works as the driver hand throughout while the left hand alternates between fine tissue control and suture management.

0–14 s: The setup is precise. The right hand loads the curved needle at the proximal-to-mid third, brings it in perpendicular to the skin, and adjusts wrist angle to follow the arc. The left hand, now with Adson forceps, delicately everts and presents the near (left) wound edge a few millimeters from the margin. The two hands create a stable working triangle over the midline slit; the suture is kept elevated and clear of the field. Everything about these frames signals a textbook perpendicular entry for a simple interrupted stitch.

15–44 s: The first passage is executed and completed. Initially, the needle is drawn out and the suture pulled through, then the needle is reloaded in the driver with the curve oriented for the return bite on the opposite edge. The right hand maintains a near‑perpendicular approach as it drives through one edge and out the opposing edge in a single, smooth arc. The left hand assists intermittently—first with forceps to steady the needle for extraction, later to control the free end—while wound edges are not aggressively grasped. The suture now spans the incision cleanly after a full cross‑incision pass.

45–74 s: The right hand continues to pull the suture through and then sets up for tying. The driver is briefly set down and reengaged as the left hand lifts and controls the needle and free limb, keeping the thread from tangling. With the bite across the wound completed, both hands return to the center to begin an instrument tie: the right hand (driver) forms loops and prepares to grasp the short end while the left hand maintains the standing limb tension. Entry and exit points look symmetric; there’s no forceful manipulation of the skin.

75–119 s: Before committing to the knot, there’s a moment of housekeeping. The needle is regrasped properly—about two‑thirds from the tip—and the right hand fine‑tunes its orientation while the left hand briefly steadies the needle body. No new tissue penetration is taken here; it’s suture and needle control to set up a clean, balanced tie. The stitch is then drawn through fully, the needle released, and the limbs are positioned to opposite sides. The right hand centers the driver over the wound for an instrument tie while the left hand draws the free end laterally and controls length. An initial crossing/throw is visible, but completion of the knot awaits the next moment.

120–149 s: The rhythm alternates between preparing the next action and securing the last. Early in this span, the right hand brings the driver back to the field, re‑secures the needle at mid‑curve, then briefly sets it down and regrips, finishing oriented to enter the near (left) edge at a right angle—ready for the next pass. Immediately after, the focus returns to the stitch already placed: the driver becomes a tying instrument. The left hand manages the short end; loops are thrown around the driver and the short end is transferred across the wound. Tension is applied in alternating directions to square the throws. The knot cinches neatly, and the edges appear approximated without inversion, consistent with a standard instrument‑tied square knot. No new needle pass occurs during the tying sequence.

150–179 s: With one stitch secured, the operator shifts into staging for the next. The right hand reloads the needle repeatedly at the proximal third to mid‑curve, dialing in a perpendicular entry angle. The left hand briefly appears superiorly to manage the strand but does not grasp tissue. These are deliberate, economy‑of‑motion adjustments on the instrument side only—no bites are taken and the wound edges aren’t everted here. The driver is even set down and regrasped once, reflecting controlled pacing and repositioning along the line of already placed simple interrupted sutures.

180–203 s: The tempo slows into assessment and pause. The left hand holds the free strand off to the side while the right hand hovers with the driver, occasionally applying fingertip pressure near the central suture line—likely to check flatness and approximation. No penetration, reloading, or tying occurs in these frames. By the end, the needle and suture lie idle on the lower‑right pad, the driver hovers peripheral to the field, and the middle incision shows three completed simple interrupted sutures with cut tails, neatly approximating the wound. The lateral incisions remain untouched throughout.

Across the full sequence, the technique evolves from meticulous setup and perpendicular entry, to smooth transcutaneous passage with clean extraction, into disciplined instrument tying with alternating tension, and then into measured preparation for subsequent bites. The hands consistently maintain clear roles—right hand driving and tying, left hand presenting or managing suture—and the suture is kept elevated to avoid tangles. The overall flow is unhurried and methodical: execute a pass, manage the strand, secure the knot, reassess alignment, and prepare for the next stitch. By the final frames, the central incision is approximated with a line of simple interrupted sutures, and the instruments rest off to the side as the field quiets.
