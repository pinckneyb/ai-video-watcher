COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with the operator focused on a midline horizontal slit in the suture pad situated between previously completed rows of interrupted stitches. Both hands are immediately engaged: a needle driver in one hand and tissue forceps in the other. The needle is a curved, swaged suture needle and is consistently grasped near the proximal third to midpoint of the curve throughout the case. From the outset the needle is oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface and advanced with controlled wrist rotation so the arc follows a smooth, orthogonal path through the dermal layer. The opposing wound edge is elevated and slightly everted with forceps (or occasionally with fingers) to present a clean dermal purchase and avoid edge inversion or crushing.

Early passes show a deliberate technique for placing interrupted dermal/skin bites. The operator approaches the margin at a consistent distance from the epidermal edge and uses the forceps to tent and evert the near lip while the driver advances the needle. After penetration, the driver re-grasps the needle, rotates through the arc, and exits through the opposite edge at a symmetric depth. The suture is drawn through with deliberate control of the tail to prevent entanglement and to allow for subsequent knot tying. Hands remain close to the wound, straddling the incision with the instrument tips converging over the center of the cut to maintain precise geometry of entry and exit points.

As the sequence progresses, the surgeon works methodically along the same horizontal line, placing sequential interrupted sutures. The needle grip and orientation are remarkably consistent: grips vary slightly between proximal-third and two-thirds-from-tip depending on the maneuver (slightly more distal when finer control is needed, slightly more proximal when force is required), but the dominant pattern remains proximal-third grips with perpendicular approach. The operator alternates which hand holds the needle driver in different segments—sometimes the right hand drives the needle while the left manipulates forceps, at other times the left driver advances while the right assists—indicating ambidextrous handling and small ergonomic adjustments as the stitch placement progresses across the line.

Forceps handling evolves in parallel. Initially the contralateral forceps are used to evert the near edge and to control the dermis for symmetric bites. At times the assistant hand stabilizes the pad or manipulates the suture tail with fingers rather than formal pickups. This tactile handling is especially evident when the operator prepares the next bite or when instrument tying is about to begin; fingers are used to hold the short tail while the driver forms loops for throws. Tissue handling throughout is gentle and precise—edges are lifted enough to expose the dermis without crushing tissue, and bites are consistently placed at similar distances from the wound margins, producing even approximation.

Knot-tying technique develops predictably as sutures are completed. After each pass the operator commonly transitions to instrument tying. Early knots are completed with two-handed instrument ties: the driver forms alternate throws over the standing part while the contralateral hand holds counter-tension. Alternating throws are cinched down centrally over the incision to seat each knot. In several sequences the operator uses two separate needle holders opposing each other to perform instrument ties, looping and advancing the suture between them to deliver secure throws. On occasion, the operator employs a two-hand (hand-over-hand) knotting technique without instruments for added control of the standing end. Scissors are intermittently introduced to trim tails after secure knotting; one set of frames clearly shows a brief use of scissors to trim suture ends and then the instrument is set aside.

Throughout the video the operator’s working geometry is steady: hands typically oppose each other across the wound with an approximately orthogonal approach. The needle driver approaches from one side toward the forceps-held tissue on the other. As stitches are sequentially placed, the operator advances laterally along the incision, moving from the mid-portion toward the ends and returning as needed to fill gaps and maintain even spacing. When a stitch is complete the driver and forceps reposition slightly lateral to take the next bite. Occasionally the operator parks the needle or allows it to trail off to the side while performing knot-tying maneuvers on a previously placed stitch; at other times the needle and thread are carried forward to expedite the next pass.

The precision of needle handling is notable. The driver repeatedly regrips the needle to adjust arc and leverage—sometimes nearer the midpoint for more refined turns, sometimes at the proximal third for a stronger purchase during passage. Needle tips are directed perpendicular to the skin, and the driver follows the natural curvature to produce smooth, consistent arcs. When taking the first bite on a particular interval, the operator often positions the forceps to tent the edge and aligns the needle for an orthogonal entry; the opposite edge is likewise prepared before completing the pass so the exit point is symmetric.

There are small variations in the way tissue is stabilized: at times dedicated Adson-style forceps are used to evert and lift the dermal margin; in other sequences the operator uses fingers of the free hand to tent the tissue and control the suture tail. Both approaches produce controlled eversion without undue traction. These variations likely reflect the operator choosing the most efficient means to prepare each bite depending on position along the line and comfort with subsequently tying the knot.

Midway through the recording, sequences show the operator transitioning between taking bites and performing instrument ties in a steady rhythm: place a bite, draw the thread through, position the tails, form alternating throws, tighten, and trim. The knot-tying evolves to a reliably secure rhythm—throws alternate direction, are cinched carefully to avoid puckering, and are seated over the wound. When a particularly snug seating of the knot is necessary, the operator uses both hands in close proximity over the wound, with one hand forming loops while the other maintains counter-tension on the standing part.

Spatial relationships between hands and the incision are managed to keep the visual corridor open. Instruments remain parallel to the wound whenever feasible, and when crossings are necessary the operator repositions to avoid tangling the suture line. The suture tails are managed laterally to keep the operative field clear; at times the left hand temporarily holds the short tail while the right driver completes multiple throws. The hands also shift subtly in elevation: as knots are advanced the hands come together over the incision to create precise loops; while taking new bites the hands separate more broadly to permit clear visualization and needle arc.

As the procedure proceeds to its later stages, the operator continues the same interrupted technique to close the remaining gaps along the line. Stitch placement remains uniform with symmetric bites and attention to edge eversion. Periodic frames show the needle parked to the side while instrument ties are performed over an already placed pass—this allows the surgeon to complete secure knots before advancing to the next interval and demonstrates an orderly cadence between suturing and knot management. Where two instruments are used to tie, the driver roles alternate and the suture is advanced by passing one instrument over and under the other in controlled throws.

Near the end of the sequence, knot-tying becomes the dominant motion as the last placed stitches are secured. The operator alternates throws, seats knots centrally, and trims tails with scissors when appropriate. The final manipulations focus on uniform approximation: each knot is adjusted to pull tissue into apposition without inversion or excessive tension, ensuring a smooth suture line. The hands end up working close together above the line while tightening the final throws, with one hand keeping steady counterpressure and the other forming and advancing the loops.

Throughout the recording there is a high degree of consistency in technique. Needle orientation, entry geometry, and eversion strategy remain steady; instrument choice (needle driver and tissue forceps) is reliable and used interchangeably by the left and right hands as needed. Small deviations—brief use of scissors, switching which hand holds the needle driver, or choosing finger control of the tail—appear as pragmatic adjustments rather than changes in core technique. These adaptations help maintain efficiency and precision while moving along the wound.

A minor note on the narrative coherence: some frame descriptions refer to different labeled cuts or positions on the pad (upper, lower, curved). For the purpose of following the procedure, these are best interpreted as the single horizontal incision being addressed in a sequential, lateral progression along its length; the operator’s actions—consistent needle handling, eversion, instrument ties, and trimming—are continuous and directed to the same linear repair. Any apparent discrepancies in the frame labels do not reflect changes in suturing method but rather small differences in how the pad or work area is described between frames.

By the end of the video the linear wound is uniformly approximated by a succession of interrupted sutures, each secured with alternating throws and neatly trimmed tails. Tissue edges are well apposed with gentle eversion, knots are seated centrally over each pass, and the line presents as continuous and stable without significant gapping or puckering. Instrumentation is set aside and the field appears tidy, indicating a controlled, completed closure using standard interrupted technique with instrument ties and occasional hand adjustments. The overall impression is of a methodical, consistent closure delivered with attention to symmetric bites, gentle tissue handling, and reliable knot security.
