COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens with the trainee positioned over the practice pad, gloves on, instruments laid out and a series of pre‑incised defects visible across the model. Although several wounds are present, the operator concentrates work on the linear wound located at the far left of the pad. From the outset the operator adopts a two‑handed technique: a needle driver in the dominant hand to control the curved needle and a pair of fine tissue forceps in the non‑dominant hand to present and evert the skin edges. Both hands remain closely bunched over the same site throughout the procedure, typically within a 1–4 cm working zone, providing a stable platform for precise small‑bite passes.

Initial maneuvers focus on accurate tissue handling and proper needle purchase. The practitioner routinely grasps the curved needle at or near the mid‑shaft—not at the very tip or exclusively at the swage—so that controlled rotation and predictable arc of passage can be achieved. Bites are taken perpendicular to slightly oblique to the skin surface: the needle tip is driven through the near edge, rotated through tissue in the classical curved trajectory, and withdrawn at the opposing margin. The forceps are used to tent and evert the dermal edge before each pass, presenting full‑thickness dermis to the needle while minimizing crush injury; the pickup position is frequently at the epidermal margin with a thumb–index grip to allow fine alignment of the two lips.

Placement follows a reproducible interrupted pattern. After each needle pass the suture is pulled through and a short instrument tie is fashioned with the needle driver and forceps. The operator alternates between securing throws and trimming tails with scissors or a small hemostat introduced briefly into the field. At times a curved dissecting scissor or ligature cutter is brought in from the lateral field to snip tails close to the knot; on other occasions a clamp is used to hold one limb while successive throws are made. These trimming and tying steps are interleaved rhythmically with needle passes so that new stitches are placed in sequence along the length of the wound.

As the sequence progresses the technique becomes increasingly consistent and efficient. Early passes show careful mid‑shaft needle grips, small controlled rotations and deliberate tissue presentation; later passes maintain that same approach but with slightly faster instrument transfer and fewer readjustments of the needle grasp point. Re‑grasping does occur occasionally when the needle needs to be reoriented for optimal exit; when that happens the operator releases and re‑positions the needle in the driver a few millimeters closer to the swage or farther out toward the shaft depending on the angle of approach. These adjustments preserve needle control and prevent undue torque on the tissue.

Edge handling is meticulous throughout. The forceps lift and approximate the near edge while the driver advances the needle through the opposite lip; bites are typically taken through the dermis or superficial dermal–subcutaneous plane rather than into any deep layer of the pad. Slight eversion of the margins is deliberately maintained in almost every stitch—this consistent everting technique ensures edge coaptation as knots are tightened and prevents inversion of the epidermal surface. Tension on the suture tails is controlled by the driver as the loop is brought down, and the operator routinely checks alignment before completing the knot stack.

Spatially, the dominant driver typically approaches from the lateral/superior direction while the forceps stabilize medially/inferiorly, although these positions interchange at times. The two instruments cross over the incision during passes; their tips meet over the wound and then separate to allow knot tying and suture cutting. Hands remain close together throughout, enabling rapid instrument exchanges and predictable needle trajectories. Occasionally only a single hand crosses the field to trim a tail or adjust tissue, but most of the work uses the stable two‑hand coordination pattern.

There are several recurrent procedural elements that recur across the timeline and highlight technique development. The operator repeatedly places sequential interrupted stitches starting at one end of the incision and progressing along its length—passing needles, retrieving the thread, tying, and trimming—so that the wound is gradually shortened and approximated. Knot stacks are compact and trimmed close to the knot to minimize suture bulk on the skin surface. When a suture tail is long or awkward, the assistant‑style forceps or a secondary clamp is used to temporarily hold the tail while the driver fashions the knot, preventing tangling and maintaining tension.

The model’s wound bed occasionally contains packing material visible in the trough; the operator takes care not to catch this material in the bite, lifting and everting only the skin edge with the forceps to ensure the needle traverses dermis alone. When the packing is present the driver’s angle is adjusted to avoid deep passes into the filler. At the superior and inferior ends of the incision the operator applies the same small‑bite interrupted technique to create secure corner anchors, then continues intermediate bites at regular intervals to close the gap evenly.

Over time the operator shows refined instrument handling. The early stage features slight readjustments and more frequent re‑grasping as the needle orientation is set; mid‑procedure, the driver grip is more consistent, needle arcs are smooth and the passes are executed with economical wrist rotation. The non‑dominant hand maintains steady presentation with minimal crush, and transitions between holding tissue and assisting with knot formation become fluid. The trainee also alternates between different needle holders and forceps depending on the need for finer control (Castroviejo‑style for delicate passes; standard Adson‑style pick‑ups for traction), which reflects adaptive instrument choice as the line of closure progresses.

Suture management evolves in the same orderly fashion. Initially there is deliberate shaping of the suture loop and methodical tightening; later this becomes more streamlined with fewer adjustments as the operator gains confidence in the bite depth and tension. Where necessary a hemostat or clamp is used to secure one limb of the suture during instrument transfer—especially when preparing to cut tails—to prevent inadvertent loosening of the knot. Scissors are introduced briefly and perpendicularly to trim tails, and the cut is made close to the knot without disturbing adjacent stitches.

Throughout the closure the operator consistently verifies tissue apposition after each tie, ensuring that the epidermal edges meet without excess gapping. Slight eversion is checked and preserved intentionally, and if a pass has resulted in an asymmetric bite the operator will replace that position by placing an adjacent stitch to rebalance tension along the line. In a few instances the practitioner performs very small supplementary bites near the end of the incision to bring residual small gaps together, rather than placing a larger single, deep bite that could distort the skin contour.

Although the main focus remains on this left‑side line, the field occasionally shows other wounds that have already been closed or are untouched; the operator does not switch between lines for fresh suturing mid‑session. There are intermittent camera or descriptive frames that reference midline or right‑side defects, and a small number of frames describe a subcuticular running pass on a central defect. These appearances are inconsistent with the predominant, persistent, and repetitive interrupted closure pattern seen on the left wound; they likely reflect either background activity, prior work that is visible in the field, or brief camera panning rather than a change in site. The operator’s hands, instruments and the bulk of needle activity remain localized to the left incision across the entire recording.

Late in the sequence the operator completes the final interrupted stitches toward the superior end of the incision. Final passes show the same compact knotting technique with short trimmed tails and careful final checks of approximation. After the last knot is secured, a final pass with forceps smooths the dermal edge to visually confirm continuous coaptation; any small residual puckering is corrected by removing a few millimeters from a tail and re‑dressing the surface with gentle pressure.

By the end of the session the wound is closed along its length with uniformly spaced, modestly everting interrupted sutures. Knots lie flush with the skin surface and tails are trimmed short. The closure demonstrates consistent dermal purchase with minimal bunching, and the skin edges are apposed without noticeable gaps or significant inversion. Packing within the wound bed, where present earlier, remains excluded from the suture line and did not become entrapped within any bite. Hand positions relax slightly as instruments are withdrawn, leaving behind a neatly approximated linear closure that exhibits the classic small‑bite interrupted pattern—methodical needle arcs, mid‑shaft needle grips for control, active edge eversion, instrument knots, and disciplined tail management. Overall, the procedure shows an initial phase of careful setup and deliberate passes evolving into a confident, efficient workflow that preserves tissue alignment and achieves consistent wound closure.
