COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
From the first frames onward the operator concentrates on the middle of the three pre‑marked vertical incisions on the practice pad. At time zero the central vertical slit—about 1.5–3.0 cm long depending on the segment observed—is identified and prepared for closure. The wound has clean, full‑thickness simulated edges with entry/exit guide dots at the ends; earlier placed interrupted sutures are visible laterally in many frames and provide orientation. Throughout the recording the actions repeatedly return to this same midline incision: bites are taken at its superior apex, moved centrally, and then carried sequentially down the length of the defect. Although brief frames at ~510–512 s show instruments oriented toward the right‑most incision, the overwhelming sequence of actions, instrument positioning, and suture manipulation consistently address the central vertical wound.

Initial approach and early suturing (0.0–44.0 s)
The session begins with a classic instrument pairing: one hand controls a needle driver, the other a toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style). The two instruments position themselves directly over the central incision at roughly 1–3 cm working distance. The needle is a curved, swaged surgical needle repeatedly grasped in the driver mid‑shaft rather than at the swage or tip; the grasp point is often mid‑body to allow rotational control. The forceps lift and evert the near wound margin while the driver rotates and pulls the needle through the opposite edge in a controlled, shallow arc. Small, precise dermal bites are taken close to the epidermal lip; tissue is approximated manually with light counter‑traction, and the operator emphasizes edge alignment with minimal bunching. The first passes appear to be the initial placement of simple interrupted stitches between marked points at the ends of the incision; thread is drawn through the wound and prepared for subsequent knotting.

Progressing bites and repetition (15.0–89.0 s)
Over the next 45–90 seconds the pair of instruments alternate roles depending on how the operator orients the pad and needle. Sometimes the left hand holds the driver and the right the forceps, sometimes the reverse; regardless, the pattern is consistent: the driver provides axial control of the curved needle and rotates it through the dermis while the counter‑instrument elevates/everts the opposing edge and controls the suture tail. The needle is typically grasped near the mid‑shaft and brought through in a curved trajectory rather than being pushed, a controlled “drive and rotate” motion that produces symmetrical superficial bites. The hands converge over the incision and often cross as the driver exits and the forceps receive the needle tip. After each pass the suture loop is pulled through, oriented across the wound, and held in readiness for tying. Several discrete interrupted passes are placed at serial locations along the central line; loops and tails accumulate across the field in preparation for individual knot tying.

Mid‑procedure development and occasional continuity (90.0–179.0 s)
As the procedure progresses into the mid‑phase the operator places additional stitches at the central and superior portions of the incision. Instrument placement remains nearly identical: driver on one side, forceps on the other, tips within 1–3 cm of the bite site. Needle grips continue to favor mid‑shaft holds; needle trajectory remains shallow-to-moderate depth, consistent with dermal-to‑epidermal purchase in the simulated tissue. Tissue bites are taken to produce slight eversion and accurate epidermal apposition. In several sequences (e.g., frames around 135–164 s and 105–119 s) the operator finishes needle passes and pulls suture tails into position, preparing to tighten knots. Throughout this span the surgeon repeats interrupted passes in a superior to inferior progression.

Notably, at times during this mid‑period several frames (around 195–269 s and especially 255 s) display a continuous looped suture line and repeated sequential bites appearing to advance a running/continuous stitch. This momentary pattern—suture pulled and progressed along the incision rather than immediately tied after each bite—creates a looped filament that travels inferiorly. The majority of frames before and after this segment, however, show discrete bite‑and‑tie behavior consistent with interrupted technique. This mixed appearance suggests either a brief use of continuous advancement to approximate a longer segment before knotting or a transient handling of a single long suture limb while finishing interrupted passes. Regardless, the operator maintains the same fundamental instrument strategies—axial needle control in the driver, counter‑traction and edge eversion with forceps—to preserve accurate edge approximation.

Controlled needle handling and bite symmetry (180.0–314.0 s)
Across the next several minutes the operator repeatedly uses the driver to rotate the curved needle through the tissue in controlled arcs. The driver is often positioned superior/medial while the forceps approach from lateral/inferior directions. The left and right hands switch responsibilities as needed, but the spatial relationships remain constant: opposing instruments converge at the wound center with tips typically 1–3 cm apart, crossing slightly during exchange. The forceps habitually pin the near edge to evert tissue and present a true dermal bite; the needle tip penetrates perpendicularly to slightly obliquely, traversing full dermal depth of the pad.

Suture material accumulates as passes are advanced: loops and tails are visible, and the operator periodically tensions and seats stitches before knotting. In some frames the needle is withdrawn and the operator prepares to place the next adjacent bite; in others the needle is passed and the suture tail drawn through with the operator moving on to knot formation. The working pattern shows methodical progression along the midline from the superior apex toward the inferior aspect. Instrument grips remain consistent—needle held behind the point to control rotation, forceps used for precise tissue handling.

Knot formation and refinement (330.0–449.0 s)
Later in the timeline attention shifts toward knot tying and securing previously placed stitches. Several sequences demonstrate classic two‑handed knot tying: one instrument steadies the suture loop, the other manipulates the free limb to form throws. The left‑and‑right hands coordinate to seat knots at the epidermal surface while maintaining slight eversion. In certain frames the operator uses fingertip control—pinching the suture with gloved fingers or holding loops directly—to orient tails and tighten knots more accurately. The left instrument sometimes functions as a thumb‑type grasper holding tails close to the wound while the right driver performs the knot throws. Slight partial occlusions of the needle or suture by the operator’s fingers occur occasionally, limiting visualization of the needle tip, but do not inhibit suture security.

Throughout knot formation the operator continues to use opposing forceps to stabilize tissue and preserve approximation. Tensioning is careful; knots are snug but not excessively tight, and suture tails remain of usable length for trimming later. Several frames show the operator forming successive throws and orienting the tails for trimming.

Final passes, trimming, and completion (450.0–512.0 s)
In the final portion of the recording the operator continues to finalize sutures along the central incision. The pattern alternates between placing remaining bites and finishing knots on earlier passes. Hands remain closely coordinated above the wound with the driver and forceps operating 1–3 cm from the incision. At times the operator manipulates suture loops with gloved fingertips while the opposite instrument tensions tails and completes the tie; scissors or a second instrument are brought in near the end to trim excess suture. The sutured line assumes a series of evenly spaced approximations across the central incision, with earlier lateral sutures visible and later central stitches tied and trimmed superior-to-inferior. By the last frames the majority of stitches on the midline are secured and trimmed; suture tails lie close to the skin surface, and the wound edges are uniformly approximated with slight, controlled eversion.

Spatial dynamics and hand evolution across the case
Over the entire procedure there is a persistent choreography between the hands and instruments. Early frames show slightly wider spacing as the operator establishes orientation; subsequently the hands converge into a compact working envelope, rarely more than 2–4 cm apart, often within 1–2 cm for fine control. The needle driver almost always supplies axial control and rotation of the curved needle, while the tissue forceps provide counter‑traction, edge eversion, and needle reception. The grip on the needle tends to be near mid‑shaft rather than at the swage, providing rotational leverage. The left/right dominance alternates somewhat—sometimes the left hand drives the needle, sometimes the right—indicating ambidextrous control of the driver if needed, but the relationship of driver versus counter‑traction remains consistent.

Hands cross above the incision frequently as the needle arc carries the tip from one side to the other; instrument tips converge collinearly across the wound for needle transfer or reception. The operator maintains close proximity throughout to regulate needle angle and depth, and periodically uses fingertip contact to tweak edge approximation or hold suture loops when tying.

Technique consistency and observed deviations
The dominant pattern is one of careful dermal-to‑epidermal approximation with controlled needle arcs and forceps‑assisted eversion, consistent with methodical skin closure. Most passes reflect simple interrupted-style behavior—pass the needle, draw the suture, seat and tie a knot—progressing sequentially along the central incision. There are intermittent frames showing a looped suture being advanced in a continuous fashion along the incision, producing a running appearance for a segment; these instances coexist with the interrupted-style sequences elsewhere in the timeline. Such variation could represent a brief continuity technique when the operator advanced a single long suture to expedite approximation before tying, or simply manipulation of an existing loop while finishing other interrupted stitches. Regardless, the underlying instrument mechanics—mid‑shaft needle grasp, rotational passage, forceps counter‑traction, slight eversion—remain constant through both modes.

Final appearance and wound status
By the end of the recording the central vertical incision is well approximated along its length. Sutures are evenly spaced and secured; earlier lateral anchor stitches and later central passes combine to produce a continuous closed line. Slight eversion of the wound edges is visible where appropriate to optimize epidermal edge apposition. Knots are seated and trimmed; suture tails are managed and kept short. Tissue handling appears atraumatic for the model: there is no evidence of tearing, dermal bunching, or poorly approximated segments. The final state shows a neatly closed central incision with suture knots secured and excess material trimmed off, demonstrating a completed, methodical skin closure sequence.

Notes on brief divergence
A small portion of the video briefly depicts instruments oriented toward the right‑most incision (510–512 s) and a short segment where a running appearance is seen (≈210–269 s). These moments are transient and do not displace the central incision as the target of the procedure; the dominant, continuous focus remains on the central vertical line and its methodical closure from superior to inferior.

Summary
Across the entire procedure the operator methodically closes the central midline incision using repeated controlled needle passes with a curved needle held mid‑shaft in a driver and counter‑traction with fine forceps. Stitches are taken to approximate dermal and epidermal layers with slight eversion; instrument positions evolve into a tight, coordinated working envelope where the driver supplies axial motion and the forceps provide tissue presentation and needle reception. The workflow cycles through needle passes, suture advancement, knot formation, and trimming, culminating in a neatly approximated and secured central wound.
