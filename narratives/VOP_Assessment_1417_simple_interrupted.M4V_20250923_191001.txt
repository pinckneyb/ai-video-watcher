COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a methodical, single-line closure using simple interrupted sutures, beginning on the lower central portion of the training pad and progressing superiorly along the same vertical wound as additional stitches are placed, tied, and finished. The operator maintains consistent, textbook mechanics throughout: perpendicular needle entry, symmetric bites, low‑profile instrument ties, and deliberate suture management with safe parking of the needle when not in active use. Across the entire sequence, surrounding incisions on the pad are left untouched; all activity builds a contiguous row along one vertical line.

The opening moments establish the site and the operator’s technique. Focus is on a short, vertical slit near the lower center of the pad. The left hand carries a needle driver; the right hand holds tissue forceps. The curved needle is grasped securely in the driver around the proximal third to the mid-body, with the curve oriented so that it will enter perpendicularly to the skin surface. The tip is poised just lateral to the left edge of the small lower slit, aimed to pass across the wound from left to right. The forceps stabilize the right wound edge without crushing, preparing the tissue for a clean, orthogonal bite. At this early stage, the needle is advanced toward the entry point but has not yet traversed the tissue completely, setting the scene for the first pass.

Immediately after this setup, attention shifts to tying the stitch that traverses the slit. The driver moves to a central position over the wound and functions as the tying instrument. The right hand alternates between forming loops with the free end and assisting in pulling the strand through; the driver tip acts as a post to grasp the short tail and then pass it through the formed loops. Throws are laid with alternating direction to square the knot and seat it directly over the incision. Tension is kept even across the two sides of the wound, bringing the edges together without inversion or gapping. The needle, still attached to the long end, is kept out of the immediate field to avoid accidental puncture; the knot seats neatly over the midline.

There is a brief sequence in which the same stitch is further secured with successive throws using an instrument tie. The needle driver remains centered over the wound as a post, while the right hand forms loops and advances each throw in alternating directions, creating a stable, low-profile knot stack. The edge approximation is maintained solely by suture tension; no additional forceps are applied to tissue during this portion. Once the knot is secure, the left hand brings scissors into the field. With the right hand holding the long end laterally to the pad’s right, the left hand trims the knot tails to a tidy length, taking care to keep the scissors aligned close to the tissue without cutting too short. Immediately afterward, the needle is reloaded. The right hand presents the needle with forceps, and the left hand re-grasps it in the driver at the mid-to-proximal third, orienting the curve for the next perpendicular entry, ready to continue along the same vertical slit.

The next stitch is placed just adjacent to the first. The driver remains to the left of the wound and the forceps to the right, presenting and everting the right edge slightly. The needle is driven through the left margin and arcs across the gap in a single, controlled rotation, maintaining uniform bite depth and equal distance from the wound edge on both sides. Once the needle exits the right edge at a symmetric point, the suture is pulled through, leaving a long free end ready for tying. The series continues with knot tying at this newly placed stitch. The needle is again parked or kept away from the immediate tying zone while the driver forms an instrument tie. Throws are alternated to build a square knot, and the operator maintains low, horizontal vectors of tension across the wound to set each throw cleanly without sliding or loosening. The hands work in close symmetry: the driver hovering just over the incision, the right hand pulling laterally and then alternating to set the knot.

Additional frames show the operator reinforcing the knot on this second stitch with more throws, again without engaging the needle in tissue. The needle holder stays just left/superior to the incision, and the right hand maintains tension on the long end, presenting loops for the driver to grasp and pass. The wound edges remain coapted from the initial pass; all force is applied through the suture to snug the edges without traumatizing the tissue. With the knot secure, attention moves to adding another stitch superior to the ones already placed.

The next pass is taken slightly above the previous knots along the same line. Here the right hand uses forceps to gently lift and evert the right wound edge, while the left-hand driver approaches from the left with the needle grasped near the proximal third. The needle is advanced on its curve, tracking through the dermal/subdermal layer to exit at a mirror point on the opposite side. This sequence demonstrates intentional variation in operator approach: at times the passage is left-to-right, and at times the working angle favors right-to-left, both times maintaining perpendicularity and symmetry to the incision. The forceps assistance remains gentle, with no crushing—just enough to present a stable bite and encourage slight eversion.

With the new stitch across the wound, the suture is pulled through and the driver transitions immediately into tying. The needle remains attached but is kept safely managed—either parked on the standing limb or controlled by the driver—while the instrument tie proceeds. The left hand’s driver forms the loops; the right hand alternates the direction of tension, keeping the knot centered over the incision and the throws compact and flat. The tie is snugged down carefully so that wound edges are approximated with mild eversion and without blanching or tearing. This pattern—place a stitch with a perpendicular, symmetric bite, then tie with alternating instrument throws—continues in a steady rhythm up the same vertical incision.

As the line extends superiorly, the operator’s mechanics stay consistent. The driver often operates just left of the incision, while the right hand either uses forceps to stabilize the right wound margin during passage or manages the long limb during tying. When forceps are used, the bites remain even in depth and distance from the wound edge; when not used, the edges still remain aligned by the effects of prior stitches and gentle traction on the suture. Throughout, the needle is grasped optimally—usually about two-thirds from the tip—to maintain control of the arc and avoid wobble or excessive torque on the tissue. The driver and forceps oppose each other across the wound, forming a stable triangle with the wound at the apex, giving the operator clear visual and mechanical control.

Following each placement, ties are completed with instrument technique using alternating throws to create square knots. The driver repeatedly serves as the post and as the grasping tool: it forms the loop, captures the short end, and pulls it through, alternating the direction of loop formation to avoid a granny knot. During these moments, the right hand maintains lateral tension on the standing limb, then switches to opposite traction as each throw is seated. The knot is consistently advanced directly over the incision and seated low, flattening against the skin without riding up the suture or slipping to one side. This sequence repeats for each new stitch added superiorly. On several occasions, the scissors appear immediately after tying, and the right hand or opposite hand trims the tails close, while maintaining slight countertraction on the strand to avoid cutting too near the knot. Again, the needle is kept parked or reloaded in a controlled manner to avoid drift or inadvertent tissue contact.

As the closure progresses further up the incision, the working segment migrates to the superior third. Here, the same pattern continues: one stitch is placed at the topmost area being addressed, then tied over multiple throws. In these segments, the driver may be held by either hand depending on access, but the spatial relationship remains consistent—one instrument just left of the wound and the assisting hand just right, with movements parallel to the incision to avoid crossing instruments over the field. The suture strand often arcs superiorly as the long limb is managed to reduce clutter at the wound. The operator remains attentive to safety: instrument tips do not cross dangerously; the needle is “parked” or controlled whenever tying dominates the activity; and the hands maintain adequate separation to reduce needle-stick risk.

The operator then alternates between adding a new stitch at the leading edge of the closure and finishing that stitch with well-controlled instrument ties. In sequences where a full pass is shown, the needle approaches the entry point perpendicularly, the bite is taken in a smooth arc, and the exit is matched symmetrically across the wound. The forceps’ role is intermittently to evert the near or far edge and to stabilize the tissue during passage, then they are put aside for tying. Other times, only tying is shown: loops are made, the driver passes through, grasps the tail, and each throw is snugged in alternating directions. At the top portion of the line, the operator periodically regrips the needle to keep an optimal angle for the next pass, even while focusing primarily on knot security.

As more stitches accumulate, the wound edges remain well-approximated with a subtle, desirable eversion. The stitch spacing and bite sizes look consistent along the length already closed, and the knots lie compactly on the side, with tails trimmed to a uniform length. Several segments are devoted entirely to finishing and tidying: the driver hovers over each knot, providing stabilization while the other hand uses forceps briefly to control the suture or the knot itself, and then scissors trim the tails. This finishing passes down the short row of stitches that now runs superiorly from the lower center of the pad. The operator keeps instrument tips aligned longitudinally with the incision, converging briefly over each knot and withdrawing before moving to the next, avoiding any sweeping or crossing maneuvers over the field.

Late in the sequence, the top of the row receives another planned stitch. The hands return to a placement configuration: driver in the left hand, forceps in the right, with the needle poised perpendicularly to the left edge near the superior limit of the previously closed segment. The forceps ready the opposite edge, and the needle approaches the entry point with deliberate control. Just before penetration, the sequence ends and transitions into tying for that superior stitch. The left hand holds the needle driver adjacent to the wound; the opposite hand alternates between Adsons to briefly stabilize and then the suture tail to build loops and tighten. The tying proceeds as before—controlled loops, alternating throws, even traction—to complete and secure the stitch. The needle remains in the driver but is not used to create new bites during these tying-focused moments. Subsequent frames show the knot being seated down to the tissue, the stand maintained on the right, and the driver grasping and laying throws until the knot is fully secure.

The final active manipulations emphasize completion and clean-up. The left hand’s driver stands by each knot to steady the suture while the right hand uses forceps as needed to position the strand and then scissors to cut tails. This repeats along the row, moving from one knot to the next in a deliberate sequence. The wound edges at this stage are consistently coapted, with the stitch line showing even spacing and mild eversion—a hallmark of a well-executed simple interrupted closure on synthetic skin. No new needle entries are made during this finishing phase; attention is entirely on tensioning and trimming. The working area remains the same vertical line that has been tended throughout; adjacent test cuts and slits remain untouched and out of the field of action.

In the concluding moments, the field is quiet—no hands or instruments are visible. The vertical wound left of center, previously the focus of all work, is now approximated over its addressed length by a series of interrupted sutures. The knots lie flat with alternating tails visible, and the skin edges are aligned without gapping. Neighboring incisions to the right remain untouched. There is no further manipulation, needle passage, or trimming—suggesting the closure on the treated segment is complete or paused in a stable state.

Across the entire procedure, the technique remains consistent and disciplined:
- Stitch placement is performed with the needle held securely—typically two-thirds from the tip—ensuring controlled, perpendicular entry and symmetric, evenly spaced bites.
- Forceps use is gentle and strategic: they are deployed to evert and present the wound edges at the moments of needle passage and then set aside during tying to avoid unnecessary tissue handling.
- Knots are formed with instrument ties using alternating throws to achieve true square knots. The driver functions as both post and retrieval tool, and the assistant hand manages the long limb to create loops, draw throws through, and seat each throw precisely over the incision.
- The needle is diligently “parked” or kept out of the immediate knot field to prevent accidental puncture and to keep the working area uncluttered.
- Tail trimming is done close to the knot with scissors brought in carefully, stabilizing the suture with either the driver or forceps to avoid trimming too short or cutting the knot itself.
- Throughout, instruments stay aligned and parallel to the incision with adequate separation to minimize crossing and needle-stick risk.

By the end, the vertical incision that began as a small lower slit and extended upward through successive placements is neatly closed over the addressed span with a contiguous row of simple interrupted stitches. The edges are well approximated with mild eversion, the knots are secure and trimmed, and the line appears uniform and stable—ready for the next phase of care or, if this is a practice model, serving as a clear demonstration of proper simple interrupted technique from first pass through final trim.
