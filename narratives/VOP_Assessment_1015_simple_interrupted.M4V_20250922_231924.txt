COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure opens with a clean synthetic skin pad that carries four parallel, vertical incisions. There are no sutures in place yet. The surgeon selects the vertical cut on the left half of the field and settles into a standard setup for simple interrupted closure. The left hand carries the needle driver and presents a curved needle grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, with the arc oriented to enter the near edge perpendicular to the skin. The suture strand trails off to the left side of the field. Opposite, the right hand brings in tissue forceps and approaches the near lip of the target slit. The forceps are used to gently lift and evert this edge to expose the dermis and set up an ideal entry site. The needle, held steady in a vertical orientation just superior to the incision, is aligned to drive a controlled arc across the gap from the operator’s left toward the right. The first bite is initiated in this manner, with careful attention to perpendicular entry and even depth.

With that initial setup, the surgeon commits to a consistent pattern. Over the next several seconds, all activity remains concentrated on the same vertical incision at the left side of the pad; none of the adjacent slits are manipulated. The needle holder stays centered just proximal to the wound line, and the right‑hand forceps continue to evert the edges. The curved needle is driven with a wrist‑led rotation, and after passage, it is regrasped to maintain its curvature for the subsequent move. The suture is pulled through deliberately to avoid sawing the tissue, and the slack is cleared so the thread doesn’t obscure the field. The surgeon proceeds in a stepwise fashion along the superior portion of the incision, placing sequential passes that are consistent in depth and spacing. Each bite adheres to the principle of entering and exiting perpendicular to the skin surface, which preserves eversion and minimizes the risk of capturing too much epidermis. The small working triangle is maintained: needle driver crossing the wound centrally, forceps positioned just lateral to the planned bite. Progress is steady, always along this one incision.

A first knot is secured near the superior end of the slit. Here, the right hand switches briefly to scissors after assisting with forceps. The needle driver, still in the other hand, is used to form instrument tie loops. The needle itself is controlled and then parked while the knot is cinched down. The edges near the superior aspect are approximated, and the knot is seated snugly at skin level. The tails are trimmed, leaving a neat, short pair that confirms completion of one simple interrupted stitch. The driver then regrips the needle and the surgeon reorients the suture to prepare for the next placement, all without leaving the original incision.

The next sequence shows another pass across the same wound. The surgeon maintains the familiar choreography: the needle is grasped roughly one‑third from the swaged end and presented perpendicular to the surface; the forceps gently elevate the entry edge, and the driver releases the needle after passage so it can be repurposed as the tying instrument. An instrument tie is formed with multiple throws, alternating direction to lock the knot while preserving eversion. The right hand helps manage the free end of the suture, providing counter‑tension as each throw is seated. Again, no other incisions are touched. The new knot draws the edges together without excessive blanching, demonstrating appropriate tension. The surgeon continues to tighten successive throws, while the needle remains out of the wound to prevent accidental stick or tissue trauma.

At this point, the loop security is refined. The surgeon finalizes knot tightening over the left‑side slit and trims the tails, leaving short ends. Instrument placement is careful: the needle driver sits superior‑left of the incision during tightening, while the forceps or scissors operate to the right side to tension and cut. In these frames, the needle is mostly parked so the driver can serve as a tying tool. A small nuance is visible: the knot sits slightly lateral to the incision’s centerline, a minor imperfection that does not compromise approximation. The suture management is deliberate; strands are kept to the operator’s right or looped away from the field to preserve an unobstructed view of the wound edges.

After the superior stitches are secure, attention shifts down the same incision. The action moves to the mid‑to‑inferior portion. The left hand holds the needle driver just left of the wound, jaws aligned over it with a vertical orientation. The right hand returns to the tissue forceps and briefly grasps the left wound edge to evert it for entry. The needle is now held at approximately the proximal third from the tip, still oriented for a left‑to‑right pass. Entry is perpendicular and at a consistent distance from the cut edge. The needle advances in a smooth arc through the near dermis and across to the far side. As before, the right hand sometimes stabilizes the needle itself or the thread to fine‑tune trajectory and ensure the exit point mirrors the entry in depth and spacing. This sequence results in another stitch being established just below the cluster already placed, building a continuous series down the same line.

Immediately inferior to that, another bite is taken. The needle is grasped mid‑shaft with the driver, and the right hand alternates between lifting the dermal edges and managing the suture strand. The driver rotates through the needle’s curve; the forceps momentarily grasp the needle tip to complete passage, demonstrating a safe regrasp technique and minimizing torque on the tissue. With that bite through, the surgeon begins tightening: loops are formed, the long strand is tensioned, and the knot is seated. Throughout this, eversion is maintained by the gentle opposition of the forceps on the near edge. No crushing of tissue is seen, and the suture is kept from throttling the dermis. The knots above show good alignment; this new throw adds to that pattern.

The work proceeds in the same vein along the incision’s inferior trajectory. One stitch is placed, tied, and then the tails are cut with scissors brought in by the right hand. The needle driver remains stationed over the incision almost continuously, only shifting momentarily to scissors when trimming is required. The pattern is disciplined and repetitive: controlled needle passage, careful suture handling, instrument ties, and precise tail trimming. The spacing between stitches is even, and the bites are taken a few millimeters from the cut edge, consistent with a sound simple interrupted technique.

There is a short interlude where the surgeon pauses to reload and fine‑tune needle orientation without penetrating tissue. The driver regrips the needle near the proximal third of the curve and adjusts the angle so the tip points squarely across the wound. The right‑hand forceps briefly stabilize the needle body or the standing part of the suture to achieve the desired presentation. The suture arcs loosely across the wound without tension as these adjustments occur, a clear sign of setup rather than active tying or passage. Hands straddle the wound: the driver remains centered over the incision, while the forceps hover just to the right and slightly below. This preparatory sequence ensures the next bite will enter and exit at matched points and appropriate depth.

With the setup complete, the surgeon resumes active closure, placing another simple interrupted stitch further down the same line. The engine of motion is identical to earlier passes: perpendicular entry, controlled rotation following the needle’s curve, exit on the far side at a symmetric point, and retrieval of the needle tip with the forceps as needed to complete the arc cleanly. The suture is pulled through without dragging, then instrument ties are thrown. The surgeon alternates hand roles fluidly—at times the right hand (marked by a yellow sleeve in some views) uses Adson forceps to oppose the driver on the other side; at other times, the operator briefly employs a second driver. The knot is seated with gentle downward and sideways tension to bring the wound edges together without creating a “cheese‑wire” effect. Tails are trimmed, and the closure moves further distally.

Additional frames dwell on knot security and tail trimming. The needle is parked off to the right during these moments so the driver can form and seat additional throws. The left hand uses forceps to manage the short tail and maintain the knot’s position, then scissors arrive to cut the ends close to the knot. Throughout the tying, the right hand draws the long strand diagonally away from the wound before the final cinch, which helps prevent stack‑slippage and preserves eversion. Once trimmed, both hands withdraw briefly, and the field remains tidy, with multiple discrete knots aligned along the suture line.

As the surgeon approaches the lower end of the incision, another pass is taken at the inferior segment. The needle driver is positioned just to the left of the slit, presenting the needle for entry. The right‑hand pickups evert and stabilize the edges in turn—first on one side, then the other—while the needle traverses the tissue in a controlled arc. The suture is pulled through and laid out across the field in preparation for tying. At this stage, the stitches above maintain approximation, and the operator preserves a consistent pattern and spacing as the work extends to the lowest portion of the cut.

Immediately following, the driver frequently repositions to adjust the bite angle precisely at the lower portion. The right‑hand forceps continue to present each edge, with short, non‑crushing grasps at the dermal margin. The needle tip is aligned to enter one edge and pass to the opposite side, mirroring earlier technique. New stitches are placed in this area, but the tying is deferred to the subsequent moments in one segment and then performed in the next. When tying commences, the needle, already through both sides, is intermittently controlled with forceps while the driver performs instrument ties. The surgeon draws the loop down in a controlled manner, approximating the wound without strangulation. Finally, scissors approach from the left, and the newly secured knot’s tails are trimmed neatly.

At the end of the series, the instruments drift off the wound toward the right and above the pad. The needle driver holds a curved needle clamped near its mid‑body and hovers away from tissue; there is no instrument‑to‑tissue contact, and no new bites are begun. The previously placed sutures on the left incision remain undisturbed, and the three parallel incisions to the right are untouched throughout. This pause suggests the active closure is complete and the surgeon is concluding or preparing to reset.

Across the entire procedure, the technique remains faithful to simple interrupted closure principles on the same vertical incision at the left side of the pad. Several core elements recur, underscoring consistency and careful tissue handling:

- Edge control and eversion: The right hand, using Adson or tissue forceps, consistently lifts and everts the wound edges just enough to expose the dermal layer for a perpendicular bite. Grasping is delicate to avoid crush injury, and the forceps release as soon as the needle has engaged the tissue. On some passes, particularly when the needle exit is near completion, the forceps briefly grasp the needle tip to guide it out cleanly.

- Needle orientation and trajectory: The needle is grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body in the driver and presented perpendicular to the skin surface. Each bite follows the needle’s curvature with controlled rotation, entering and exiting at matched distances from the edge. Reloading is frequent and purposeful; when orientation drifts, the surgeon pauses to regrip and re‑angle the needle tip so it will drive across the gap cleanly.

- Suture handling and field management: The suture strand is kept away from the immediate work area—directed to the right when convenient or looped anterior to the pad—so it doesn’t obscure the edges. During tying, the needle is often “parked” off to the side to reduce hazard and free the driver to form throws. The long strand is tensioned gently and in a direction that seats the knot without sliding it laterally. When trimming, scissors approach carefully, and tails are cut short but visible.

- Instrument roles and hand position: The needle driver predominantly rests just superior and to the left of the wound, crossing the incision during passage, while the forceps are positioned inferior/right, opposing across the gap. There are moments where the right hand takes the driver role or a second driver appears, reflecting natural adjustments for access and visibility as the closure progresses distally. Spatially, the hands straddle the slit throughout, maintaining a compact, controlled working triangle.

- Stitch progression along one line: The surgeon begins near the superior segment of the left incision, establishes the first closures, then works progressively inferior. Several stitches are placed and tied in succession, with occasional brief intervals devoted solely to knot security and tail trimming. As the work descends to the mid‑to‑inferior and then inferior end, the pattern remains the same: eversion, perpendicular bites, controlled passage, instrument ties, and tidy trimming. There are brief setup periods where no tissue penetration occurs, used to optimize needle orientation for the next pass.

- Quality of approximation: The completed stitches show consistent spacing and bite depth. Edge apposition is uniform, with slight eversion maintained along the line. Knot placement is close to the incision; at one point a knot rests slightly lateral to the centerline, a minor deviation that does not compromise closure. Throughout, there is no sign of excessive tension, strangulation, or tissue crush. The final visual shows a tidy row of interrupted knots along the left incision, with short, well‑managed tails along the superior and middle sections and newly trimmed ends toward the distal portion.

In summary, the surgeon selects and closes the vertical incision on the left side of the pad using a series of simple interrupted stitches. The work proceeds from the superior portion down the length of the slit, in a methodical sequence of bite placement, suture pull‑through, instrument ties, and tail trimming. The needle is frequently reloaded to keep the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin, and the forceps are used sparingly but effectively to evert the edges. The spatial relationship between instruments is consistent; the driver and forceps oppose each other across the wound with careful suture management to maintain a clear field. The other parallel incisions are not manipulated at any point. By the end, the left incision is fully approximated with multiple discrete, evenly spaced knots, the edges are aligned with appropriate eversion, and the instruments have withdrawn from the wound, indicating a clean and orderly completion of the closure on that single line.
