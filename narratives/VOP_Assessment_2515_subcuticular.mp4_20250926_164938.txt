COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single vertical skin incision on the practice pad — a straight cranio‑caudal slit located slightly right of the pad midline (often described as the right‑central or upper‑right quadrant). From the first frames through the end of the recording, all activity is concentrated on this same incision: an ongoing serial interrupted skin closure where the operator places additional individual stitches adjacent to an existing row of interrupted sutures until the line is effectively approximated and secured.

0.0–14.0 s — initial approach and first bites
Work begins at the proximal portion of the right‑side incision. The operator uses a classic two‑instrument, two‑handed technique: one hand presents and stabilizes tissue with fine toothed forceps (commonly Adson‑style) while the other holds a needle driver. A curved surgical needle on monofilament suture is grasped in the driver around the mid‑shaft/proximal third, the curve oriented to follow a controlled arc through tissue. The forceps provide counter‑traction and slight eversion so the needle can be driven through a perpendicular-to‑oblique bite that transfixes epidermis and superficial dermis. Passes are short and controlled; bites are skin‑only or superficial full‑thickness of the simulated dermis. After the needle exits, the suture is drawn through in preparation for knotting.

15.0–29.0 s — serial placement adjacent to prior stitches
The operator continues immediately adjacent to the previously placed stitches. Hands remain within a few centimeters of the wound as instrument tips converge over the closure. The needle is consistently grasped near the body (mid‑shaft) to permit predictable rotation; the opposing forceps lifts the far edge and receives the needle tip. Tissue handling is atraumatic: delicate elevation and light eversion are used rather than crushing force. After each pass the suture tail is managed and the next bite is planned just lateral to the prior stitch, maintaining even spacing and apposition.

30.0–44.0 s — controlled superficial bites and tensioning
A short section of the incision just left of an already completed row receives more sutures. The left hand typically controls the needle driver and advances the curved needle through elevated dermis while the right hand controls suture slack, readies tails for tying, and tensions newly placed stitches. The needle is grasped in a mid‑shaft grip with the tip pointed toward the far edge for a characteristic curvilinear bite. After passage, the edges are approximated and the suture is tensioned — the pattern of sequential interrupted stitches continues along the line.

45.0–74.0 s — repetitive, coordinated instrument passes
Throughout this period the operator reinforces a consistent rhythm: forceps lift and evert, needle driver rotates and advances. Grasp points vary slightly (mid‑shaft to near the swage) depending on approach angle, but the intent remains the same — short dermal bites, perpendicular‑to‑oblique entries, and careful eversion for optimal epidermal apposition. Instruments cross occasionally over the wound, and suture tails accumulate alongside earlier knots. The operator frequently repositions the needle rather than making a long continuous pass, favoring interrupted single‑stitch technique.

75.0–104.0 s — focus shifts along the line, hands maintain proximity
Work moves incrementally along the incision, alternately addressing superior and inferior gaps as needed. Hand roles are stable: one hand stabilizes tissue laterally/medially while the other drives and rotates the needle. Needle orientation is adjusted so the convex curve of the needle passes smoothly through tissue. The bites are shallow to intermediate in depth in the simulated dermis; there is little to no visible tissue crush and approximation continues to prioritize slight eversion. Suture tails are looped and prepared for instrument ties.

105.0–149.0 s — completing bites and preparing knots
The operator concentrates on both placing new bites and retrieving the needle in preparation for knot tying. Forceps and needle driver tips meet at the bite site with short working distances to facilitate needle transfer. The left and right hands work from slightly different approach vectors (lateral, medial, superior), but coordination is consistent: lift, present, pass, draw through, tension. The series of interrupted stitches builds down the incision, each stitch realigning and stabilizing adjacent tissue.

150.0–194.0 s — coordinated elevation and rotation for reliable capture
As the sequence continues, forceps intermittently lift and evert the edges while the needle driver advances the curved needle through the opposite margin. The operator maintains control by grasping the needle near the shaft to rotate it through the dermis in a standard arc. Slight eversion of the epidermal edge is used intentionally to ensure edge‑to‑edge contact when the stitch is secured. Tension is applied judiciously to avoid puckering; earlier knots stabilize previously approximated segments while the operator advances to the next gap.

195.0–239.0 s — approaching superior end, repeated pattern
Activity is concentrated at the superior end of the closure line. The same working pattern persists: forceps lift and present, needle driver bites through the dermis, and the trailing suture is drawn through. The hands remain approximately one to four centimeters apart, frequently crossing instrument paths for needle transfer. Suture placement remains interrupted and sequential — each stitch is placed adjacent to the preceding one to reduce gap and maintain even spacing.

240.0–284.0 s — close coordination and precise hand placement
The operator continues to add stitches superiorly and medially along the incision margin, with the right and left hands alternating roles depending on approach. Needle grips vary (mid‑shaft, proximal third) to accommodate approach angle; the curve of the needle is used to maximize control and ensure consistent depth. Forceps continue to evert the edges slightly, and the operator prepares ligatures and instrument ties in quick succession. Throughout this stage the operator’s movements are compact and deliberate, minimizing tissue trauma.

285.0–329.0 s — working a small adjacent defect and a noted deviation
Frames in this interval show the operator addressing a small oval defect near the completed row, yet the same closure technique is applied: tenting the flap with toothed forceps and passing a curved needle through full‑thickness skin edges. The opposition of instruments across the small defect allows precise needle transfer and alignment. One notable deviation appears near 315–329 s: the needle is held directly between the operator’s fingertips rather than in a needle driver. This fingertip grip is a departure from the prior instrument‑assisted control and is noted as a potential reduction in stability during passage. Otherwise, needle passage, suture drawing, and preparation for knotting continue as before.

330.0–359.0 s — finishing the superior‑most stitch and tidying tails
In the closing frames the operator focuses on the superior‑most portion of the incision. Needle passages, retrieval, and knot manipulation are visible in sequence; forceps provide the final tissue stabilization and capture of the needle tip as stitches are tightened. Edges are slightly everted and well approximated across the line. The operator adjusts tension, arranges suture tails, and prepares for snipping. Instrument positions converge closely over the wound — often within one to two centimeters — to perform final passes and secure the last interrupted stitch.

Technique progression and consistency
From start to finish the operator adheres to a classic interrupted skin‑closure technique using a curved needle and monofilament suture. The essential elements remain consistent: using fine toothed forceps to present and evert the wound edge, employing a needle driver to grasp the curved needle near the mid‑shaft/proximal shaft for controlled rotation, taking perpendicular‑to‑oblique bites through the epidermis and superficial dermis, and drawing the suture through to tie secure interrupted knots. Variations are minimal and pragmatic: occasional adjustments in grasp point (closer to the swage or at mid‑shaft) to accommodate different approach vectors, and a brief fingertip hold of the needle late in the sequence. Tissue handling remains atraumatic throughout, with deliberate gentle traction and minimal crushing. The operator consistently uses short working distances and instrument crossing to increase precision.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Hands remain in a tight operative envelope over the incision the entire time. Early frames show the left hand commonly using forceps for traction while the right hand controls the needle driver; later frames show role reversal at times depending on superior or inferior approach. Both hands maintain proximity — typically within 1–4 cm of each other — enabling coordinated needle presentation, transfer, and suture management. Instruments cross over the plane of the wound regularly to facilitate needle capture. When the operator adopts a fingertip needle grip, fingertips come into direct contact with the skin edge to assist in alignment. Throughout, movements are compact, precise, and designed to minimize unnecessary displacement of the simulator pad.

Final state of the closure
By the end of the video the vertical incision is closed with a continuous series of interrupted epidermal/dermal sutures spaced uniformly along its length. Wound edges are approximated with mild eversion to optimize epidermal apposition; earlier knots provide stable, progressive closure as subsequent stitches are added. There is minimal puckering localized to areas with tightened knots, but overall the line reads as well aligned and secure. Suture tails are being organized and readied for trimming. The single incision has been systematically closed from one segment to the next using instrument ties and standard interrupted technique, with a brief noted deviation in needle control technique that did not appreciably alter the intended closure pattern. Overall, the operation demonstrates consistent, atraumatic handling and methodical progression of interrupted sutures to achieve satisfactory approximation of the simulated skin edges.
