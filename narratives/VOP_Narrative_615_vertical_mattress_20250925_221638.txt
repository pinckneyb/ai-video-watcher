COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video documents a single, continuous closure of one linear skin incision on a synthetic practice pad. The operator works methodically along the same incision from start to finish, adding successive simple interrupted stitches, manipulating tissue and suture tails, tying and trimming, and progressively approximating the dermal/epidermal layers. The work is concentrated in the left-central quadrant of the pad (the most medial/left-hand linear incision cluster), and the camera captures repeated cycles of needle delivery, tissue presentation, suture advancement, knot formation, and tail trimming. Below is a chronological reconstruction of the procedure integrating all observed instrument positions, needle management, tissue handling, and suture progression.

Initial approach and first passes (0.0–44.0 s)
At the outset the performer positions both gloved hands directly over the pad within a compact working envelope (≈1–4 cm instrument separation). One hand holds a metal needle driver in a classic driving grip while the other hand holds fine Adson-style tissue forceps. A curved suture needle is seated in the driver roughly at mid‑shaft or slightly toward the tip; the driver’s jaws are used to rotate the needle in short controlled arcs. The forceps present and evert the near wound edge to expose epidermis and dermis for purchase. The needle is driven from near to far across the incision at a perpendicular-to-oblique angle, taking superficial-to-mid dermal bites in the synthetic tissue. Thread trails from the needle as the performer pulls the suture through; prior interrupted stitches adjacent to the immediate area are visible, indicating staged, sequential closure. Hands are closely opposed—driver above/over the wound; forceps lateral/adjacent—coordinating needle passage and suture control.

Sequential interrupted placement and technique reinforcement (15.0–179.0 s)
Over the next minute and a half the surgeon establishes the pattern of closure. Repeated cycles show the needle grasped mid‑shaft in the driver and rotated through the opposing wound edge while the forceps elevate and slightly evert the near margin. Bites are deliberate and shallow-to-moderate depth, consistent with superficial dermal approximation on a silicone/foam pad. The operator frequently repositions the needledriver grip (sometimes closer to the tip for finer control, at other times higher on the shaft for more leverage), but the motion remains the classic needle‑driver arc. The non‑driving hand alternates between using forceps to present tissue and holding/pulling the free suture tail to maintain tension. Tissue is approximated with modest tension—edges align without excessive puckering—and the operator keeps the suture line neat and in sequence, placing stitches directly adjacent to previously completed ties.

Mid-procedure cycles: needle passage, retrieval, and knot preparation (180.0–359.0 s)
As the procedure progresses the technique becomes repetitively efficient. The driver continues to approach the wound from above, rotating the curved needle through one edge then the other; the forceps retrieve the exiting needle/suture and steady the tissue while the free hand draws the thread through. The performer’s hands remain in close working proximity (typically 1–4 cm), occasionally crossing minimally but mostly remaining in an opposing posture: the driver superior/central and the forceps inferior/lateral. After each pass the suture limb is manipulated to prepare for knot-tying—either laid across the wound, tensioned by hand/finger, or held with the forceps while the driver forms throws. Several frames show the operator pulling the suture taut and then forming a knot; in other moments scissors enter the field to trim tails after the knot is secured. These cycles repeat along the length of the incision so that sequential interrupted stitches are created in a row, each serving to align and slightly evert the skin margins.

Technique nuances and small adaptations (360.0–539.0 s)
Throughout the middle portion of the video the performer demonstrates minor variations appropriate to the task: the needle is sometimes grasped nearer the swage when a shorter arc is needed; at other times the grip is more distal for deeper purchase or finer manipulation. The tissue handling remains atraumatic: forceps pinch and evert the epidermal lip rather than crush it; fingers are occasionally used to provide gentle counter‑traction and to steady long suture tails before knotting. The operator maintains modest tension on the suture to appose the dermal edges and preserve a slight eversion of the wound margin—a deliberate cosmetic technique to counteract inversion during healing. Repeated frames show the performer completing a pass, pulling the suture through, tying secure throws, tensioning the knot, and trimming the excess tail—then immediately preparing the next bite adjacent to the previous knot. Instrument spacing remains small, favoring precision.

Progressive closure toward midline and adjustment (540.0–699.0 s)
Later in the video the sequence continues uninterrupted along the same incision. The performer alternates between passing fresh needles and completing knot sequences. In several passages the driver is held vertical and the needle passed in short arcs near the wound edge to take small epidermal/dermal bites; in subsequent frames the grip and approach angle are adjusted slightly—perpendicular, oblique, or a shallow 45°—to accommodate local geometry of the incision and previously placed stitches. The operator sometimes uses the non‑dominant hand to steady the pad, pull suture tails out of the way, or manipulate the tissue directly with gloved fingertips to achieve accurate approximation. The overall rhythm is methodical: pass, retrieve, tension, tie, trim.

Final passes, tightening, and trimming (700.0–732.0 s)
Near the end of the recording the performer finishes the remaining stitches in the row and concentrates on knot security and tail management. Frames show the driver and forceps tightly opposed over the most recent stitch while the performer advances and tightens final throws; a scissors or cutting instrument appears to trim suture tails cleanly close to the knots. Instrument positions for these finishing maneuvers are tight and clustered—one hand applies axial control/traction while the other manipulates the knot and trims. The skin edges along the entire worked segment are consistently approximated with modest eversion and minimal gapping.

Hand positions and instrument relationships across the procedure
- Dominant roles: Throughout the procedure one hand consistently serves as the needle‑driver operator while the other provides tissue control and suture management. Across frames the laterality of those roles occasionally appears to swap (some shots show a left‑handed driver while others show a right‑handed driver), but the functional pattern remains constant: a needle holder rotates and advances the curved needle; the opposing hand presents tissue, retrieves suture, manages tails, and assists with knot formation and trimming.
- Proximity and coordination: Both hands remain close to the incision (typically within 1–5 cm) to allow precise needle arcs and immediate control of suture tension. Instruments converge over the same small working zone; crossing is minimal and brief. The needle driver typically hovers medial/superior to the wound, with the forceps lateral/inferior or slightly caudal.
- Grip and needle handling evolution: The grip on the needle alternates between mid‑shaft and nearer‑tip positions to modulate control and arc radius. The driver is occasionally locked near the hinge for a firm hold when seating the needle, while at other times it is held more longitudinally for finer rotation. These small adjustments reflect normal, skilled variability to achieve consistent bite depth and placement.

Pattern, technique consistency, and evolution
Throughout the recording the operator adheres to simple interrupted suture technique. Each stitch follows the same core cycle: present and evert the near edge, pass the curved needle through the far edge then the near edge (or vice versa depending on orientation), pull the suture through, tension to approximate, form secure throws to create a knot, and trim tails. The depth remains superficial-to-mid dermal on the practice pad; bites are kept close to the wound margins to maintain cosmetic alignment. Slight eversion is intentionally created and preserved with each knot. There is no conversion to a different suture pattern (no running or continuous passes are used); rather, the closure is built stitch-by-stitch along the length of the incision in a deliberate, serial fashion.

Tissue response and approximation quality
The synthetic skin responds predictably: small eversion at each stitch, minimal puckering, and close apposition of epidermal edges. The performer consistently adjusts bite size and needle arc to maintain even spacing and consistent tissue edge coaptation. Tension is modest and controlled to avoid excessive tissue strangulation. When tying knots, the operator steadies one limb with forceps while forming throws with the driver (or vice versa), producing compact and secure knots that lie just above the approximated margins. After tail trimming the line appears tidy and even.

Final state of the repair
By the end of the recording the worked incision is closed along the segment addressed: a neat row of interrupted sutures runs along the length of the examined zone. Wound edges are well opposed with a slight but uniform eversion along the margin. Knots sit atop the skin surface with trimmed tails removed to a short remnant. The closure is consistent in pattern and technique from the first visible stitch to the last: sequential simple interrupted placements producing progressive and durable approximation of the simulated dermis and epidermis. Instrument handling throughout is coordinated and economical—needle driver and forceps remain in complementary roles with minor, purposeful grip changes to refine needle control or knot security.

Notes on observational inconsistencies
Frames occasionally show slight variability in which hand appears to be driving the needle (left vs. right) and small differences in needle grip location and approach angle. These variations are routine adjustments rather than changes in suture pattern. All observed actions are in service of the same serial interrupted closure strategy, and the operator maintains continuity of technique, progressive placement of adjacent interrupted stitches, and methodical knotting and trimming until the incision segment is brought to a secure, cosmetically acceptable final state.
