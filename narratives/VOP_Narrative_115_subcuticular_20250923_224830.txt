COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
From the first frames through the end of the recording the team concentrates closure efforts on the right‑most longitudinal incision of the pad — the straight, full‑thickness slit at the extreme right of the field. What follows is a stepwise, methodical closure of that single incision, performed with repeated cycles of needle preparation, perpendicular dermal bites, tissue presentation and edge eversion, suture advancement, knot formation using instrument ties, and tail management. The narrative below follows the procedure chronologically and stitches together the many short actions into a coherent account of how the right‑side wound is managed from initial pass to the scene at completion.

Initial approach and setup
Hands first appear with a familiar, consistent posture: a needle driver carried in the operator’s left hand (approaching from the left side of the pad) and Adson/tissue forceps in the right hand working just lateral to the wound edge. The curved needle is repeatedly grasped in the needle driver about the proximal third of its curve (sometimes described in frames as roughly one‑third to two‑thirds from the tip depending on the reload), and the jaws hold the needle so its plane of curvature brings the tip nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. Forceps in the right hand lift and evert the near wound margin to present dermis for a clean bite. This “opposed hands” arrangement — driver from the left, forceps from the right — creates the working triangle typical for precise interrupted closure.

Across the early passes the team emphasizes perpendicular entry and symmetric bites. The needle is presented at a right angle to the epidermis, wrist rotation is used to follow the needle’s arc through the tissue, and the far edge is retrieved with the driver (or occasionally with pickups) so that the suture spans the gap in a controlled loop. Bites are consistent in distance from the wound edge, with gentle traction on the forceps to tent the dermis and maintain eversion; there is no evidence of unnecessary crushing or deep undermining. The suture tail and loop are managed to the operator’s right or superior to keep the surgical field clear.

Progression of passes and variation in technique
Early in the sequence the operator establishes a foundational stitch low on the incision near its inferior end, placing a full needle pass from one margin to the other and pulling the strand through to form a neat loop across the wound. After this initial pass the needle is reloaded, repositioned, and another perpendicular bite is set up a short distance proximal to the first. That pattern — reloading, aligning the needle so it remains orthogonal to the skin, everting the edge with the forceps, driving the needle across the opposite margin, and retrieving it — repeats several times as closure advances superiorly along the slit.

Intermittent episodes show instrument exchanges and role changes. Although the left hand most commonly maintains the needle driver, there are intervals where the right hand assumes the driver (particularly when the operator needs to change orientation or perform a specific pull), and the left hand brings forceps or a second needle holder for assistance. Reloading is frequent: when the initial grasp would place the needle unfavorable for perpendicular entry, the needle is regrasped farther toward its mid/body so that the arc will enter the epidermis at the correct angle. These re‑grips and the careful orientation adjustments underscore an intent to preserve consistent dermal purchase with each bite.

Knot formation and suture management
After several passes are placed and the suture is drawn through the wound, the team routinely secures interrupted stitches with instrument ties. The driver is used as the “post” and the tails are wrapped or crossed using the opposing instrument to create throws; multiple throws are observed being seated to secure knots. Scissor use appears intermittently and purposefully: after sufficient throws are placed, the assistant uses scissors to trim tails close to the knot. Knot seating is performed without excessive tissue strangulation — the forceps and driver alternate to tension and centralize the knot so it sits neatly over the approximated wound edges.

There are moments when a long suture strand is pulled across the incision forming a visible spanning loop; in some sequences, after both bites are taken the operator pulls the free end to draw tissue edges together but does not immediately complete a tie, leaving a loop temporarily across the wound while repositioning instruments or reloading the needle. Other sequences show full instrument‑tying and tail trimming at the same working level, indicating alternating cycles of placing a bite and then securing it before moving proximally.

Hand position evolution and ergonomics
Throughout the entire closure the hands maintain an opposed, complementary relationship around the incision. Early frames depict a classic left‑handed driver approach with the right hand providing tissue control. As the procedure unfolds, hand positions adapt dynamically to the task: the left hand will approach from superior‑left and cross obliquely to take a bite; the right hand will shift from directly lateral to superior‑right to provide the best eversion and countertraction; on knot tying the needle driver is used inferiorly or as a post while the forceps or a second instrument manipulates tails. These small shifts keep the instruments close to the wound (within a few millimeters) and preserve a narrow, centered working space over the right slit.

When knot tying is underway, the hands briefly move to either side of the wound axis so the driver and pickups can perform instrument ties without the needle impeding the throws. After knots are seated and tails trimmed, both hands withdraw slightly and then re‑approach to set up the next bite. Toward the mid and later stages of the recording the operator sometimes draws the strand along the incision axis with repeated tugs to check approximation; at those moments the left and right hands coordinate to tension and align already‑placed bites.

Tissue handling and wound edge management
Forceps consistently present and evert the epidermal margin so the needle can enter at the correct level to capture dermis. The team avoids forceful crushing: the pad is tented gently, and bites are taken at similar distances from the wound edge to produce symmetrical purchase and good approximation when the knots are tied. The pairings of entry and exit points demonstrate an intent to achieve matched dermal depths on both sides of the incision, which is essential for eversion and good cosmetic approximation.

Throughout, there is no evidence of undermining or deep fascial manipulation; the work is confined to the epidermis/dermis layer simulated by the pad. Retrieval of the needle across to the opposing margin is smooth, with the driver or pickups used as needed to capture or guide the needle tip.

Temporal pattern of work along the incision
Procedurally, the team progresses from inferior to superior along the slit. An early pass near the inferior end is followed by a sequence of bites that ascend the length of the wound. Midway through the case the operator completes a stitch near the upper third and secures it with multiple instrument throws; tails are trimmed and the knot is left centrally seated on the wound line. Several further passes are placed between these initial and proximal stitches as the operator methodically fills the gap along the mid‑portion of the slit.

Notably, some frames capture moments where the needle is not being actively driven — these intervals serve as preparation: reloading the needle, repositioning the driver for optimal grip, organizing the free tail so it does not obscure visualization, or momentarily parking instruments. There are also brief episodes where the operator tightens an already placed section of suture along the incision axis, producing a line of approximated bites and a continuous strand that is tensioned and adjusted. These scenes reflect normal suture management between discrete interrupted throws rather than a single change of overall closure technique.

Consistency and small deviations
Overall the technique remains consistent: perpendicular entries, controlled wrist rotation to follow the needle curvature, forceps‑mediated eversion and gentle traction, instrument ties with the driver as post, and use of scissors to trim tails. Minor variations are evident but explainable — the needle is sometimes grasped slightly more distally or more proximally on the curve depending on the required travel and entry angle; the right hand occasionally assumes the needle driver role to facilitate a specific grab or passage. There are also short periods where the needle or driver is not visible because it has been parked and the operator is handling the suture strand alone to adjust tension — for example, one interval shows repeated pulling of the strand without a needle in hand, apparently to organize or tension previously placed bites.

These small inconsistencies do not alter the established technique. If anything, they reflect real‑time adaptation to maintain perpendicularity of entry and the ergonomics necessary to pass and tie stitches reliably along the wound.

Spatial relationships and instrument choreography
At almost every step the instruments approach the incision from opposite sides, frequently crossing above the wound to permit secure needle drives and clean retrieval. The suture tail and loop commonly trail diagonally across the field (superior‑left to inferior‑right or vice versa), and the team routinely manages that slack to keep the field uncluttered. When instrument ties are performed the driver acts as a stationary post centered over the incision while the opposing instrument manipulates the tail to form throws. Scissors are brought in from the lower right or inferior‑right to complete tail trimming.

The choreography is economical: instruments are kept within a close envelope over the right slit, moving only as much as required to reload, present tissue, withdraw the needle, and tie. The occasional pause where both instruments withdraw and rest briefly to the side is used to reassess orientation, re‑grasp the needle at an optimal point on its curve, or prepare for the next throw.

Final phases and end state
Toward the end of the recorded sequence the operator places and secures additional bites in the superior portion of the slit, ties instrument throws, and trims tails. There are also segments showing the suture strand being tensioned along the wound axis and adjusted — an action that both checks approximation and aligns knots and tails. In the final visible frames the instrument set is parked left‑lateral to the pad and hands have withdrawn; the leftmost incision (which had earlier stitches) is visible with prior closures intact and the central incision remains largely unmanipulated for the remainder of the footage. The right slit displays multiple placed and secured bites along its length; knot placements are visible near the upper portion and elsewhere as stitches were completed, and the wound edges show regions of good approximation with eversion where knots have been seated.

Overall assessment and procedural completeness
The closure of the right slit is methodical and consistent with practiced technique. The operator repeatedly ensures perpendicular dermal entry, uses forceps to evert and stabilize the edges, manages needle orientation by reloading the shaft as needed, secures knots with instrument ties, and trims tails to tidy the field. While there are brief periods focused on suture management (loops across the wound or tensioning without immediate tying) and occasional hand‑role swaps, the underlying approach remains uniform and oriented toward interrupted stitch closure along the length of the incision.

A small procedural note: a few frames show activity at the central slit and periods where the operator adjusts a continuous strand or tensions previously placed bites. These moments are brief relative to the predominant work on the right slit and appear to be either preparation for further passes or management of already‑placed suture material. The recording ends with instruments parked and the right‑side incision approximated by multiple secured stitches and trimmed tails, indicating procedural completion of the closure for that incision in the observed field.
