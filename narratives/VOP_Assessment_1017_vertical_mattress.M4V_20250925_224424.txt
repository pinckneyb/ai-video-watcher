COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
A single vertical skin incision on the practice pad serves as the sole focus of the entire sequence. The wound sits on the right/upper-central region of the pad and is repeatedly addressed from its superior margin, with a row of previously placed interrupted stitches already occupying the inferior portion. From the outset the operator works methodically along this same linear defect, adding sequential interrupted sutures while alternating needle passage, suture advancement, knot-tying and trimming. Through the recording the approach remains deliberate and repetitive: the needle driver (predominantly in the operator’s right hand) and a toothed tissue forceps (predominantly in the left) operate in close tandem, typically within a two- to four‑centimeter working envelope immediately adjacent to the wound.

Initial frames show the wound partially closed inferiorly with multiple tied interrupted knots. The operator initiates closure at the superior extent, stabilizing the near edge with forceps to lift and present a narrow dermal margin while the needle driver approaches from a slightly cranial or lateral trajectory to deliver the curved, swaged needle through the opposite edge. The needle is almost always grasped away from the tip — commonly mid‑shaft or just proximal to the tip — giving the driver leverage for a controlled, arc-shaped pass. Needle orientation is repeatedly adjusted so the arc will traverse from lateral-to-medial or superior-to-inferior across the cleft; most passes are made with the needle tip driven in a near‑perpendicular to oblique plane relative to the skin, producing short, controlled purchases through the dermis.

Tissue handling is consistent with a simple interrupted technique: the forceps lifts, everts and approximates the epidermal/dermal edge while the driver passes the needle through a full-thickness or dermal/subcuticular bite on the far side. The operator aims for dermal capture rather than superficial epidermal-only bites; many passes clearly transfix the dermis and include subcutaneous simulant, producing a predictable slight eversion of the wound margins at each stitch. At times small gaps are briefly visible before the suture is tightened — particularly at the superior-most portion early in the sequence — but the operator promptly draws the suture through and performs knot maneuvers to seat the edges. As the sequence continues, gapping becomes less frequent and edge apposition improves as each knot is secured and tails managed.

Needle handling technique is steady but shows minor variations. Across many passes the needle is held mid-shaft for controlled rotation through the tissue, with the driver performing the characteristic wrist or arm rotation to complete the curved trajectory. Occasionally the grip is placed a little closer to the tip (2–3 mm from the point) when a finer purchase or tighter curvature is required for a shallow bite near the epidermal margin. Likewise, the approach angle varies between frames — sometimes the driver comes from above and medial, sometimes from the upper-right — but the motion remains a short, clipped arc that seats the needle point and exits cleanly. After exit, the needle is withdrawn, and the suture is pulled through so the operator can prepare for knot-tying.

Knot-tying and suture management are interleaved with needle passes throughout the case. Several frames capture the stage immediately after needle exit: the operator manipulates the free tail with forceps while the driver or a second instrument secures the working limb, creating throws and alternating hands to form secure square knots. Scissors appear intermittently to trim tails after knots are completed. The driver is sometimes repurposed from needle driving to suture handling — tensioning and stabilizing the suture during knot formation — a typical practical pattern in interrupted closure. In other sequences the operator uses one hand to hold the suture limb and the other hand to place throws with the driver or forceps, repeatedly alternating to snug knots while preserving slight eversion of the wound edges.

Throughout the procedure the operator maintains a consistent spatial relationship between instruments and wound: the forceps habitually present and evert the near edge immediately adjacent to the incision while the driver approaches closely from the opposite side to drive the needle across. The instrument tips often overlap the incision plane during passage, and their paths cross above the wound axis in many frames, allowing tight coordination of bite depth and alignment. Hands remain close — typically only a few centimeters apart — enabling precise control and rapid transitions from needle passage to suture tying. When retraction is necessary, the nondominant hand occasionally employs a fingertip or thumb retraction to stabilize the pad beneath the forceps, increasing control for shallow or precise dermal bites.

Over the course of the video there is a clear, linear progression of work: the operator starts at the superior end of the existing knot line and proceeds proximally along the same vertical cut, placing successive interrupted stitches until the open superior segment is brought into apposition and final knotting/trimming is completed. The pattern is repeatable and rhythmic: lift and evert with forceps, place the needle through a controlled arc capturing dermis, withdraw the needle and pull the suture through, form secure knots with alternating throws while maintaining edge eversion, and then trim tails. Occasionally the operator pauses to reposition the needle driver or to adjust the tissue presentation; these micro-pauses allow consistent bite placement and prevent excessive tissue trauma.

Technique development over time is subtle rather than dramatic. Early passes reveal occasional minor variability in bite depth and a small amount of gapping prior to tightening — particularly at the topmost portion of the wound initially. As the closure advances, the operator’s bites tend to become more consistent and slightly more superficial in some frames, reflecting a deliberate choice to favor dermal apposition and eversion without over‑penetrating deeper tissue. A few passes are explicitly shallow dermal engagements intended to evert skin edges without undue bulk, while others clearly take a full-thickness dermal-to-subcuticular purchase for stronger approximation. This mix of bite depths suggests adaptive technique: the operator matches bite depth to local tissue geometry to optimize edge alignment. In several frames, tissue handling is handled lightly and precisely to avoid crushing, and the forceps maintain tissue integrity while achieving the desired eversion.

Hand positions evolve primarily in response to the specific motion required at each step. The dominant hand remains primarily the driving hand for needle manipulation, approaching from above, lateral, or cranial as required; the nondominant hand consistently performs tissue presentation and suture management. At times the roles slightly invert — the left hand may act as the driver in a few frames — but the general pattern of one instrument presenting tissue and the other manipulating the needle persists. During knot-tying phases the driver is sometimes held vertically above the wound while the forceps manipulates tails, and scissors intermittently enter the field to trim suture ends. Hands also shift along the cranio‑caudal axis as closure progresses: after securing a stitch, the operator repositions instruments slightly more superiorly to address the next bite. Instrument approach angles vary within a consistent envelope: the driver typically approaches from an oblique superior-right or superior-left angle, while the forceps present from a lateral or medial hand position, crossing above the incision during passes.

Spatial coordination remains tight throughout. Instrument tips are usually within one to a few centimeters of each other and the wound, minimizing long lever arms and reducing inadvertent tissue drag. This proximity allows quick transition from needle pass to knot formation and tail management. When performing shallow dermal bites, the needle trajectory is shortened, and the forceps often move closer to provide a better platform for the needle to seat. Conversely, full-thickness passes occasionally require a slightly larger arc and thus a marginally wider separation between instruments during the brief needle rotation.

Quality and consistency of approximation improve as the sequence continues. Early frames show slightly more variability in edge apposition, with minor gapping or uneven eversion at times; later frames demonstrate uniform slight eversion along the entire repaired length and smoother alignment as the superior portion is systematically closed and knots seated. The operator’s handling of tails and knot security remains controlled: tails are kept manageable and cut with scissors when appropriate, preventing loose trailing suture and making the line neat.

A few brief inconsistencies are observable in the recording: descriptors of pad location vary slightly across frames (right-central, midline, slightly left-of-center), and there are moments when instrument use shifts (driver used to manage tails rather than to pass the needle). These do not alter the fundamental approach — interrupted dermal sutures delivered with a curved swaged needle and coordinated forceps handling — but they are worth noting when interpreting the footage. At certain times a stitch appears to be a shallower dermal bite rather than a true full-thickness purchase; elsewhere the needle clearly transfixes through dermis and underlying simulant. The operator adapts to the microanatomy of the model and the requirements of the closure, balancing bite depth, eversion and tissue handling to achieve satisfactory apposition.

In the concluding frames the superior wound segment has been closed. The line of stitches forms a continuous, evenly spaced column of interrupted knots running inferiorly along the original defect; the previously gaping superior edge is approximated and secured. Final knots are tightened with attention to eversion, tails trimmed, and instruments withdrawn from the field. The completed closure exhibits uniformly slight edge eversion consistent with proper dermal capture and secure interrupted technique. Overall, the sequence documents a focused, methodical interrupted-suture closure performed with steady needle control, consistent forceps presentation, and progressive improvement in bite uniformity and edge approximation as the operator advances cranially along the incision until complete closure and final suture management are achieved.
