Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Six completed simple interrupted sutures were placed on the single wound, producing a clean, well-approximated closure with subtle eversion and secure, neatly trimmed knots. The operator demonstrated sound fundamentals: perpendicular passes, symmetric bites, careful edge handling, and consistent knot construction. To reach a higher standard, streamline instrument choreography. Minimize hand switching and needle regrasping, pre-plan approach angles to avoid setup pauses, and keep the free end organized to prevent unnecessary repositioning. Maintain the same spacing cadence to avoid crowding near the top. Overall, technically competent and safe, with efficiency and micro-consistency as the next targets for improvement.
