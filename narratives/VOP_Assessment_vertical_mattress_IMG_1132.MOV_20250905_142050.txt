Pattern: Vertical Mattress

1) Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes
The operator consistently places single, through-and-through bites with perpendicular entry and uniform dermal depth but does not perform the paired near-near, partial-thickness return after a far-far pass. The absence of the far-far/near-near sequence is a major deviation from the vertical mattress technique.

2) Gentle tissue handling
Forceps use is light, protective, and strategic to evert and guard edges, with the suture kept off the skin and slack cleared laterally. Consistent single, purposeful grasps with no crushing exceeds standard, with only minor extra handling during extraction.

3) Square, secure knots
Instrument ties are alternating and squared, seated levelly over the incision with appropriate tension and neatly trimmed tails. Repeated, reproducible knot sequences indicate reliable security.

4) Balanced tension deep vs superficial
Knots are seated with even, opposing tension without epidermal strangulation, but there is no clear deep-support/superficial-approximation balance because the near-near component is not executed. Without a true vertical mattress construct, layered tension balance is below standard.

5) Even spacing (0.5â€“1.0 cm)
