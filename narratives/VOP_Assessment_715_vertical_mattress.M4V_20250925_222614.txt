COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The case documents a steady, methodical interrupted‑suture closure performed on the leftmost vertical incision of the silicone practice pad (the incision occupying the left third of the model). From the start through the final frames the operator concentrates on that left‑side linear wound, advancing a single, continuous program of sequential interrupted stitches along the same incision. While a few brief frames show instruments near or manipulations of other nearby test incisions, the continuous surgical effort and all needle passes, edge control, suture management and knot work are focused on that left column of the pad. Below is a chronological reconstruction of the entire procedure, integrating hand positions, instrument use, needle technique and progressive tissue approximation.

Initial approach and first bites (0–90 s)
The operator begins by orienting over the left‑side wound and establishing the basic instrument pairing: a needle driver (held in the dominant hand) and fine toothed tissue forceps in the nondominant hand. Early frames show the needle driver being presented from above/medial while forceps approach from lateral/below, the tips converging within 1–3 cm of the incision. The surgeon consistently grasps the curved suture needle along the shaft (commonly at the mid‑shaft to distal third, sometimes nearer the swage), orienting the convex curve to enter the epidermal margin and pass through full‑thickness dermal tissue in a controlled arc. Bites are placed close to the wound margin—near to far and then far to near across the opposing edge—so that epidermis and dermis are engaged and edges approximate without gaping.

Throughout these opening passages the non‑dominant forceps lifts and stabilizes the near edge, everting it slightly to promote edge apposition once the stitch is tightened. The needle driver delivers the needle at a roughly perpendicular‑to‑oblique angle depending on local approach vector, rotating through tissue with the driver tip oriented toward the curve. Instrument spacing is close (often 1–4 cm), with the two hands working in opposing but tightly coordinated arcs. The pattern of work establishes a sequence of simple interrupted bites placed sequentially along the superior portion of the incision.

Developing a regular interrupted pattern (90–210 s)
As the procedure progresses the operator continues to place interrupted stitches in a cranial‑to‑caudal sequence (or vice versa depending on the current bite), maintaining consistent inter‑stitch spacing and similar tissue bite depth. The needle is repeatedly grasped at mid‑shaft in the driver, occasionally closer to the swage for control when the angle requires it. The forceps alternate between approximating edges, receiving the needle tip as it exits, and managing suture tails.

During this phase the surgeon’s hand positions evolve subtly with each pass: sometimes the operator’s right hand performs needle control with the left hand providing forceps support, and on other passes the dominant/ nondominant relationship appears reversed relative to camera framing — a reflection of adjusting approach vectors rather than a change in technique. Regardless, one hand consistently assumes the role of precise needle driving while the opposing hand provides atraumatic edge control and suture management.

Needle entry angles are chosen to produce modest eversion at the apposed edges, considered desirable to prevent wound inversion. Bites are uniformly full‑thickness through the dermal analogue, avoiding excessive tissue purchase that could bunch or create puckering. The operator places a succession of interrupted stitches, each pass followed by pulling the suture through and preparing for knot formation; several earlier stitches have already been tied and trimmed as work advances along the wound.

Addressing small and curvilinear defects near the same line (210–330 s)
Midprocedure frames show the operator responding to slight variations in the incision geometry and tissue behavior. The wound segment near the superior end occasionally presents small irregularities (a short transverse or stellate area), and the operator adapts by taking slightly smaller, more precise bites for those portions. Forceps are used to evert radial edges of stellate or semicircular defects so that each interrupted stitch coapts the margins without undue tension.

Needle handling remains consistent: the curved needle is grasped toward the mid‑shaft for most passes, and the driver arcs the needle through in a single controlled motion. The non‑dominant instrument continues to receive the needle tip as it exits, allowing rapid transfer of the needle and passage of suture while minimizing needle manipulation in open air. Instrument tips remain in close proximity (1–3 cm) to maximize control during needle transfer and suture pull‑through.

When the wound contours require it, the operator varies the bite orientation to maintain even spacing and preserve edge eversion. Suture tails are organized and tensioned with a secondary instrument as stitches are completed, and intermittently the operator stabilizes a previously placed loop while forming the throw. The general rhythm is clearly sequential: pass the needle, pull suture, tie a knot (or prepare the knot), cut the tail as appropriate, and move to the adjacent site.

Refinement, knot tying and suture management (330–420 s)
Later sequences focus on tightening, knot formation and final adjustments of the same left incision. The needle driver and forceps positions become slightly closer, reflecting the transition from needle passage to knot tying and suture trimming. In many frames the operator uses the forceps to hold the suture tail while the driver forms and tightens throws; at other times both hands are used to manipulate the knot, one applying tension while the other forms the loop.

Knot technique is consistent with standard interrupted practice: controlled throws to secure the stitch while avoiding over‑tightening. The operator maintains edge eversion as knots are tied, using fingertip compression or the forceps to counter‑pressure so that knot tension approximates dermal layers without causing inversion or ischemic blanching. During this period there are frames showing the needle driver handling suture rather than a needle, indicating transition from passing stitches to tying and trimming.

Throughout this finishing work the surgeon also checks alignment along the entire suture row, adjusting adjacent stitches to keep spacing even and tissue apposition uniform. Minor re‑approximations and additional minor passes refine the coaptation, ensuring a neat, continuous line of interrupted closures from one end of the incision toward the other.

Hand and spatial dynamics across the procedure
Across all phases the interplay of hands and instruments follows a predictable pattern. One hand consistently controls the needle with the driver — the grip point on the needle varies between mid‑shaft and nearer the swage depending on the needed leverage and angle — while the other hand uses toothed forceps to evert, stabilize and receive the needle. Both hands work within 1–6 cm of each other, typically within a few centimeters of the wound, allowing direct opposition across the incision.

Approach vectors shift depending on the segment of the incision being treated: the driver often comes from a superior/medial or upper‑left direction while the forceps approach from lateral or inferior quadrants; on some passes the driver approaches from the operator’s right with the forceps stabilizing from the opposite side. These minor adjustments permit optimal needle trajectory and minimize instrument crossing. When knot tying is required the hands draw even closer, and the operator intermittently uses the free hand to manage suture tails or to compress edges while securing throws.

Technique consistency and evolution
Technique remains fundamentally consistent throughout the case: sequential simple interrupted stitches with controlled, mid‑to‑near‑swage needle grasp, forceps‑assisted edge stabilization, full‑thickness dermal bites placed near the epidermal margin, and slight intentional eversion to promote healing. The operator preserves this approach even when geometry varies (stellate, semicircular, or short transverse portions), adapting bite size and orientation but not changing the underlying closure method.

Over time the operator’s speed and economy of motion improve: early passes are deliberate, while later passes and knot formations show greater fluency and tighter instrument choreography. The operator also shows increasing attention to even inter‑stitch spacing and consistent knot tightness as the procedure progresses, producing a uniform, cosmetically acceptable closure.

Managing adjacent incisions and instrument repositioning
Although the left longitudinal incision is the locus of the procedure, frames occasionally depict instruments resting near or manipulating suture tails on adjacent central or right‑side incisions. These moments typically involve suture management or short pauses rather than a shift in focus; in one late pair of frames a right‑most vertical wound appears with a completed row of interrupted sutures, but throughout the video the operator’s active needle passages, passes and knotting remain concentrated on the left column. When instruments momentarily move across the pad they are used to handle suture tails, tension previously placed knots, or reorient the operator’s hands — not to switch to a different closure line.

Final checks and wound state (420–451 s)
In the closing sequences the operator performs final tightening, organizes and trims suture tails, and runs a last check along the entire length of the left incision. The left hand often manipulates the suture with a driver or scissors while the opposite hand steadies the skin and assesses approximation. By the final frames the wound is closed with a contiguous series of evenly spaced interrupted sutures, each producing mild eversion of the epidermal margin. Knots sit on the surface, suture tails are external and trimmed, and there is no evidence of gross gapping or tissue bunching.

The skin edges are consistently well approximated with slight eversion, indicating good dermal layer coaptation. Instrumental manipulation has been atraumatic; forceps use is precise, avoiding excess crush injury to the simulated tissues. The overall cosmetic alignment is neat and uniform across the treated segment.

Summary assessment
Over the duration of the recording the operator performs a methodical, sequential interrupted‑suture closure of the leftmost vertical incision on the practice pad. Repeated use of a curved needle held mid‑shaft, precise opposing forceps control, and deliberate knot formation produce a regular line of interrupted stitches with slight edge eversion and uniform spacing. Hand positions adjust dynamically across passes—alternating approach angles and crossing minimally—but the essential driver/forceps partnership remains constant. By the end of the case the incision is fully approximated with tied and trimmed interrupted sutures, the wound edges everted and aligned, and suture tails managed. Minor frame‑to‑frame appearances of activity near other incisions reflect momentary instrument repositioning or suture management rather than a change in the focus of closure. Overall the procedure shows consistent technique, progressive refinement and a well‑executed interrupted closure of the left‑side incision.
