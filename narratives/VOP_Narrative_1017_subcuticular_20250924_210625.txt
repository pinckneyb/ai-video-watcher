COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single vertical skin incision located in the left upper quadrant of the training pad (the long narrow left-sided slit near the cranial/cephalad corner, second from the viewer’s left). From the first frames through the end of the recording the operator concentrates on bringing that left-sided linear defect into precise skin-to-skin apposition using hand-held instruments and a curved suture needle. The work proceeds in a stepwise, repeatable fashion: present and stabilize the near edge with toothed forceps, grasp the needle with a needle driver, drive a full dermal-to-dermal bite through the opposing edge, draw the suture through, manage slack and tails, and prepare for knot-tying. Throughout the sequence the surgeon favors small, controlled arcs of the curved needle and careful eversion of the wound margin to promote edge approximation without strangulation.

Initial approach and first passes (0.0–44.0 s)
At the outset the operator positions both hands close to the left slit. The non-dominant hand holds toothed Adson-style tissue forceps to lift, stabilize and slightly evert the superior/ lateral wound edge; the dominant hand brings a needle driver in from above and lateral positions. The curved needle is routinely grasped near the mid‑shaft (not at the swage) in a transverse grip that allows rotation through a predictable arc. Needle entry is frequently perpendicular or slightly oblique to the skin surface, with the tip driven through the epidermis and dermis in a single controlled pass. Bites are short and superficial-to-mid dermal on the synthetic pad, aimed to capture dermal tissue for secure apposition. Suture material trails laterally as the needle is pulled through; the assistant hand maintains counter‑traction on the free end. Early maneuvers show the operator setting a consistent bite depth and angle, establishing the tactile and visual rhythm that will be repeated for each stitch.

Progressing along the superior pole (45.0–104.0 s)
The operator advances sequentially along the superior portion of the left incision. Hands remain closely apposed to the wound, usually within 1–4 cm of the margins; the right hand remains dominant for needle control while the left hand steadies and everts tissue. Needle grips remain mid‑shaft to distal, facilitating a smooth curvature and minimizing lateral twisting of the pad. Bites continue to be full‑thickness through the dermal analogue without attempts at deep-layer closure; the focus is on epidermal and dermal apposition. Suture tails are managed predictably — one tail is held or draped away while the other follows with the needle — keeping the working field clear for successive passes.

Mid-procedure refinement and repeated interrupted placements (105.0–179.0 s)
As the work proceeds, the technique shows consistency and refinement. The operator repeatedly takes short, controlled bites, using the forceps to evert the near edge and present the dermis for purchase. The needle is rotated through an arc that is either perpendicular to the plane of the skin or slightly tangential when required to control tissue eversion. Where needed, the surgeon repositions the needle grip closer to the body of the needle for increased control on tighter bites near the apex of the incision. The hands alternate small adjustments in spacing and angle, but the established pattern—forceps lift, driver delivers, suture pulled through—remains constant. In these mid frames the suture material is clearly visible entering and exiting the tissue as each pass is completed, and the operator manages slack consistently so that each bite aligns the edges without puckering.

Superior-to-inferior progression and tissue handling nuances (180.0–239.0 s)
The operator continues advancing the closure from the superior end toward more central and inferior points of the same left slit. Instrument approach angles vary subtly depending on the local geometry of the incision: at the apex the needle may be introduced at a slightly more perpendicular angle to avoid skiving; along straight segments the driver approaches from a lateral or superior vector for an efficient arc. The forceps are used not only to evert but also to control the small flaps of synthetic skin as the suture line lengthens. Suture bites remain dermal and atraumatic, with light-to-moderate tension maintained to hold approximation without overt strangulation. Throughout this period the operator’s technique remains methodical—consistent grips on the needle, consistent placement of forceps, and consistent sequences of pass, pull, and prepare for knot-tying.

Management of suture tails and intermittent pauses (240.0–299.0 s)
As more bites are placed, suture tails accumulate and are periodically controlled by the non-dominant hand or draped off the working area to prevent entanglement. The operator occasionally rests instruments momentarily at the periphery of the field; in some frames hands are not visible, and instruments lie idle at the pad edge. These brief pauses are accompanied by frames showing the wound with multiple tied stitches already in place along its length, demonstrating that individual interrupted knots have been completed between passes. There are segments where instrument activity is not captured clearly and where other nearby incisions also display suture material; however, the primary focus returns repeatedly to the left-sided slit where the operator resumes the same bite-and-tie cycle.

Return to fine control and completion of sequential bites (300.0–329.0 s)
Following the intermittent pauses the operator resumes with the same two-handed technique: forceps to evert and present a clean margin and needle driver to deliver a precise dermal bite. Grip positions are adjusted slightly depending on where along the slit the bite is taken (closer to the swage for small apical passes, more distal on longer arcs), but the underlying mechanics remain uniform. On several passes the left hand’s role expands to active suture management — pulling slack and positioning tails for efficient knotting once the needle pass is completed. The operator preserves slight eversion at each stitch to ensure that, when tightened, the epidermal edges will meet slightly raised rather than inverted, a standard goal for a cosmetically favorable closure.

Late-stage observations and occasional inconsistencies (330.0–368.0 s)
In the later frames the pattern of technique is maintained: controlled needle arcs, near-edge eversion, and careful suture management. Some frames in this segment include images where attention appears concentrated on other incisions to the right or midline of the pad and where no hands are visible for several frames. Those moments represent a deficiency in continuous documentation rather than a change in method — in subsequent frames the original left slit continues to show the same interrupted stitch pattern and the operator returns to the same approaches. The final available images show the left slit approximated by multiple interrupted sutures, with slight eversion along the bite sites and suture tails projecting laterally. Instrument positioning in these frames indicates that the operator has finished a series of sequential stitches and left the field with ties in place rather than leaving long loose loops amenable to further runs.

Technique consistency and technique development
Across the entire sequence the operator demonstrates a high degree of consistency in technique. The method remains a traditional interrupted skin closure: two-handed control with forceps presenting the near edge and a needle driver delivering a curved needle through dermis-to-dermis, followed by suture retrieval and preparation for knot-tying. Where subtle evolution appears, it is limited to ergonomic refinements—slight adjustments in needle grip location to accommodate tight apices, marginal changes in the approach vector to control needle entry, and progressive efficiency in suture tail handling. There is also evidence that the operator stabilizes and evens tension better with later passes, suggesting incremental improvement in tissue handling as the closure advances.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Early in the recording both hands are tightly clustered around the superior pole of the slit, with the needle driver coming from a superior-lateral vector and the forceps approaching from an inferior-medial vector. As the line is advanced, the needle driver’s approach rotates marginally to remain optimized for each bite—sometimes approaching more laterally, sometimes more superiorly—while the forceps track along the incision maintaining everted presentation. Hands remain within a close working envelope (generally 1–4 cm separation) throughout, permitting efficient transfer of the needle and control of suture tails. When the operator pauses, instruments are either rested at the pad margin or the non-dominant hand withdraws slightly to manage tails; these short-term changes do not materially alter the working geometry when activity resumes.

Final wound appearance and closure state
At the conclusion of recorded activity the left-sided incision is approximated by a series of interrupted sutures providing close dermal and epidermal contact with mild eversion at the bite sites. The wound edges are aligned without inversion, and the overall line is smooth and continuous in appearance. Suture tails are visible and drape laterally from the knots, indicating that interrupted throws have been completed rather than leaving a continuous running line. The tissue analog shows no overt puckering or undue tension concentrators; instead the bites are evenly spaced and uniformly tensioned, producing a cosmetically favorable closure. Where the documentation is incomplete (occasional frames without hands or showing activity on other incisions), the left slit’s closure in subsequent frames confirms that the same interrupted technique was resumed and carried to logical completion.

Noted documentation gaps and minor inconsistencies
Throughout the recording there are intermittent frames that either show no hands or instruments at rest, or include activity at other incision sites (midline or right-sided slits). These moments represent gaps in capture rather than a change in intended method; they complicate continuous visualization of every knot-tying maneuver and make it difficult to enumerate exact stitch counts. Nevertheless, the predominant and recurring image series clearly demonstrates that the operator’s attention remains on closing the left upper vertical slit using repeated interrupted dermal bites, careful eversion, and controlled needle handling until the line is satisfactorily approximated.

Overall impression
The procedure is an orderly, methodical closure of a superficial full‑thickness left-sided skin incision on a synthetic pad. The operator adheres to a two‑handed technique—forceps for tissue presentation and needle driver for controlled delivery of a curved needle—placing successive interrupted stitches from the superior aspect downward and managing suture tails to maintain a tidy field. The technique shows minor ergonomic refinements over time but remains fundamentally consistent. By the final images the incision is neatly approximated with evenly spaced, mildly everted interrupted sutures and secure knots in place, yielding a well-aligned, low-tension closure appropriate for the simulated skin model.
