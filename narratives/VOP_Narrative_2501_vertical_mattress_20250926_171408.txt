COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single vertical skin incision located slightly left of the center of the practice pad. From the beginning to the end of the recording the operator methodically closes that same left‑of‑center vertical wound, advancing along its length by placing successive simple interrupted sutures, tying and trimming each as they proceed. The approach is deliberate and bimanual throughout: the dominant right hand consistently controls the needle driver to present and drive a curved suture needle in short controlled arcs, while the nondominant left hand uses fine tissue forceps or fingertip pickup to lift, evert and approximate the opposing wound margin and to manage the suture tails.

Early in the sequence (0–44 seconds) the operator establishes the rhythm of repair. With the incision open and slightly separated, the left hand elevates the near edge using Adson‑type forceps and the right hand holds the curved needle in the driver about one‑third to one‑half of the way from the tip or mid‑shaft depending on the particular pass. Needle trajectory is planned so that each bite enters the epidermis/dermis at a near‑perpendicular or slightly oblique angle and exits the opposing edge at a similar depth, producing full dermal purchase with slight eversion of the skin surface. Hands are closely approximated over the wound—typically 1–3 cm apart—so that counter‑traction and needle transport are tightly coordinated. During these initial passes the operator consistently values precise bite depth and edge eversion, ensuring that the needle enters and exits at comparable heights on each lip to achieve good epidermal apposition when tied.

Between 45 and 119 seconds the operator continues placing interrupted stitches moving along the vertical slit. The needle grip in the driver is frequently adjusted — sometimes held nearer the tip for fine short bites, other times gripped mid‑shaft to allow controlled rotation through the arc of the curved needle for a more assertive purchase. The non‑dominant hand alternates between holding tissue with forceps and manipulating the free suture limb to maintain tension, while the dominant hand advances the needle in short, controlled arcs. The instrument tips converge directly over the bite site: the needle driver typically approaches from a superior‑lateral axis while the forceps come from an inferior‑medial axis, and they meet within a few millimeters of the epidermal edge. After each pass the suture filament is drawn through and held under light tension by the assistant hand, preparing for knot tying. The operator routinely maintains slight eversion—consistent with simple interrupted technique—to avoid inversion of the epidermal edges when tied.

At approximately 60–120 seconds, repeated passes demonstrate consistency in stitch placement and spacing. The operator's hands remain close to the wound; the needle driver performs controlled rotations so the needle tip exits through the far dermal plane at a mirror depth to the entry point. The left hand continues to evert and approximate, sometimes using fingertip pressure rather than forceps for fine alignment. Across these frames the suturing technique is consistent: isolated transcutaneous dermal bites, retrieval of the needle, pulling of suture tails, and preparation for knot tying. Several previously placed interrupted sutures anchored to the right of the wound (a reminder of earlier work along this same incision) serve as landmarks that the operator uses to keep spacing and tension uniform.

From about 120–179 seconds the operator moves to adjacent portions of the same vertical incision, repeating the established pattern: needle entry from one edge, passage through the full dermal thickness, exit on the opposing margin, approximation and knotting. During some passes the needle driver is grasped closer to the swaged end for stronger purchase and rotational control; on finer bites the grip shifts nearer the tip. The nondominant hand alternately provides counter‑traction, everts the skin, and manipulates the suture tail to avoid twisting or catching on adjacent tissue. There are occasional frames in this interval where motion suggests tightening and adjustment of previously placed knots rather than a fresh transcutaneous pass; these moments are used by the operator to ensure even tension along the line and to smooth the approximation before proceeding to the next stitch.

A brief divergence is noted around 75–89 seconds and again near 165–179 seconds where the visual pattern in a subset of frames resembles sequential consecutive passes with the suture being pulled through between bites—an appearance that could be interpreted as a running/continuous technique. However, overall context and the preponderance of frames show the operator placing discrete isolated bites and tying them, and the workflow returns to a pattern of isolated stitch placement and knot management. The intermittent appearance of a continuous line is likely due to visual overlap of suture manipulation between individual interrupted passes or camera angle; in practice the operator maintains isolated interrupted manipulation and returns to knot tying and trimming after each bite.

From 180–239 seconds the operator continues cranio‑caudal progression. The hands tighten their coordination: the dominant right hand typically approaches from a superior or lateral vector and drives the needle across the wound, while the left hand steadies the opposing edge and prepares to receive the needle. At times the lower hand functions as a guide for the exiting needle tip, ensuring a smooth trajectory and minimizing trauma to the synthetic tissue. Needle handling remains precise—grasp points on the needle vary to match bite size and curvature, but the overarching principle is control of needle arc so exits occur predictably. Throughout this middle portion the operator maintains gentle tissue handling, avoiding excessive traction. The stitches are placed at fairly uniform intervals along the incision with a consistent dermal bite depth, producing mild eversion and good edge apposition.

Between 210 and 274 seconds, there is emphasis on finishing stitches at the superior portion of the incision while ensuring previously placed knots remain secure and evenly tensioned. The assistant or operator occasionally repositions suture tails and uses a small clamp anchored to the board to stabilize suture lines while other stitches are being placed—this facilitates controlled knot tying and avoids entanglement of adjacent tails. Scissors appear in later frames near 270–284 seconds indicating trimming of suture tails after knot security has been confirmed. The operator periodically pauses between passes to smooth tissue and confirm alignment with earlier sutures, using the previously completed stitches as a template for spacing and eversion.

From roughly 285–314 seconds the operator concentrates on the more superior and inferior gaps of the same long midline incision, finishing remaining open sections. Needle passes continue to be mid‑dermal to full dermal thickness, and the hands maintain their usual proximity—1–4 cm apart—allowing tight bimanual control. The dominant hand maintains a steady delivery of the needle through short arcs while the nondominant hand manipulates tissue and suture tails to prevent slack or twisting. As stitches are completed, the operator ties secure knots and trims excess filament. The knot‑tying technique appears consistent (secure square knots tightened down to approximate edges with slight eversion) and the operator habitually ensures that knots sit flat and do not overly invert the wound margins.

The final quarter of the recording (315–327 seconds) shows the operator making final passes and completing cranial stitches on the second vertical incision from the left (which is continuous with the same left‑of‑center vertical column of closure). The hands converge over the wound; the needle driver approaches from above while the stabilizing hand presses directly over the incision to align the epidermal borders as the final bites are taken. With each tie the operator tests the approximation, smooths the edges, and trims tails. By the end of the sequence knots are present along the length of the repaired incision; the epidermal surfaces are closely opposed with consistent slight eversion, and there is no evidence of undue gaping or excessive tension at the margin.

Throughout the procedure spatial relationships and ergonomics are consistent. The operator remains close to the working field, keeping both hands within a small working radius so that instrument tips meet near the epidermal edge. Needle orientation alternates between perpendicular and slightly oblique to the skin surface, chosen to achieve symmetric bites on both sides. The grip on the needle driver shifts as needed—closer to the tip for short, precise entries and slightly more proximal for full‑arc rotations—allowing controlled needle purchase without repeatedly regrasping inappropriately. The nondominant hand functions variably as tissue stabilizer, suture‑tail manager, and occasionally as a guide for the needle tip on exit, maintaining fine control over edge eversion and preventing twisting of the filament.

Technique consistency is high: the operator favors simple interrupted dermal/epidermal bites with attention to eversion, consistent bite depth, and careful knot security. When frames suggested alternative patterns (brief appearances of a running pass or activity on other incisions), the dominant procedural pattern remained sequential interrupted closure along the single vertical line just left of center—other suture rows present in the field are static landmarks or previously completed work and are not actively reworked. Minor deficiencies in visual assessment occur when needle tips are intermittently occluded or when camera angles temporarily obscure which exact incision is in focus, but instrument kinematics and the continuity of the stitch sequence support a single, continuous repair of the same vertical wound.

At the conclusion the incision is uniformly approximated along its length with evenly spaced interrupted sutures, each tied to provide gentle eversion and to bring epidermal edges into precise apposition. Suture tails have been trimmed as needed, and previously placed sutures remained undisturbed while new stitches were added sequentially along the same line. The overall closure is tidy, atraumatic to the simulated tissue, and demonstrates consistent bimanual technique—controlled needle handling, effective counter‑traction, and dependable knot security—resulting in a smooth, apposed, and well‑everted linear closure.
