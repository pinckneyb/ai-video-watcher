COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone skin pad with multiple practice incisions, but the surgeon’s work consolidates around a single line: the straight vertical wound on the left side of the field, just left of center. Other wounds (a right‑side vertical line with multiple preexisting knots, a central/midline vertical slit, and a small horizontal cut) appear intermittently as the field shifts and the operator briefly manipulates them. Those glances do not change the progress or the stitch count on the left vertical wound, which remains the continuous focus for closure with simple interrupted sutures.

Initial approach and first passes on the left vertical incision
At the outset, the left vertical incision is clean and fully open, with no knots on its margins. Both hands settle at the inferior third of this line. The right hand controls a needle driver, securing the curved needle at about the proximal third of its body, maintaining a perpendicular orientation to the pad. The left hand uses Adson forceps to gently lift and evert the near (left) wound edge at the lower apex. With exposure established, the right hand advances the needle orthogonally into the dermis/subcutis, respecting the needle’s arc. The tip emerges into the wound, and the needle is then guided to traverse to the far edge. Early here, the surgeon focuses on controlled entry points and a crisp, vertical trajectory rather than speed; bites are placed with short, deliberate arcs, and the left hand alternates between stabilizing the near edge and crossing to the far edge to counteract needle torque. No tying is performed yet, and the wound remains without any completed sutures.

The operator then repositions slightly upward along this same incision, maintaining the same approach at the lower third. The needle remains grasped near the proximal third-to-midpoint, perpendicular to the skin, and the forceps work without crushing, lifting the dermis just enough to expose a proper bite. The technique is consistent with simple interrupted closure: near‑far passage with the wrist rotating to carry the curve, regrasping the needle tip as needed to deliver it through the second edge. These early sequences emphasize bite quality and edge eversion rather than completing a knot; the line still has no finished stitches.

Continued work at the lower third maintains these principles: right hand with the driver placed just superior/central to the targeted point, left hand with forceps providing exposure and countertraction across the wound. Bites are a few millimeters from the margin, depth appears symmetric, and there is no excessive traction. The needle is routinely parked at the proximal third in the jaws to maintain a strong, predictable arc. Throughout, the edges are held gently, with only the minimum traction needed for needle passage; eversion is achieved by lifting the dermis rather than by deforming the edge.

Interludes outside the left incision do not change its status
At one point, the view swings to a separate, short horizontal cut in the lower-left quadrant. The operator places and ties a single stitch at that site. This is an intentional detour and unrelated to the closure of the left vertical line. The left vertical wound’s stitch count remains unchanged during this interlude.

The camera also intermittently captures the right vertical incision and, later, the midline incision, where tying or preparation occurs. These moments are not part of the closure sequence for the left vertical wound and do not contribute to the stitch count that we track. Each time the operator returns to the left vertical incision, the same principles—perpendicular needle orientation, gentle eversion, and controlled arcs—are resumed at the precise segment of that left line being closed.

Return to the left vertical incision; establishing the first completed stitches
When attention returns to the left vertical incision after these brief excursions, the wound now shows visible progress: two simple interrupted sutures are present along its length. The right hand hovers with the needle driver above the upper stitch while the left hand uses Adsons and then scissors to tighten and trim. No new bites are driven during this brief finishing sequence; it is a consolidation moment to set tension and tidy tails. These two knots demonstrate appropriate edge approximation without overblanching, and the suture line remains aligned with the incision axis.

Building the third stitch at the superior end of the left incision
The next working sequence focuses on adding a stitch at the superior end of the left vertical incision. The right hand, again with the needle driver, positions just above and slightly left of the incision; the left hand alternates along the near and far edges to present tissue for the bite. The needle is grasped at about two-thirds from the tip (proximal third from the swage side), oriented at nearly 90 degrees to the skin. The entry is placed on the left wound edge at the superior end, then the driver regrips and carries the curve across to the opposite edge. Throughout, the left hand’s forceps lift and evert just ahead of the needle, producing a subtle outward roll of the dermis so the bite includes robust dermal tissue and avoids inversion.

Immediately after passage across both edges, instrument ties are formed. The left hand secures the free suture end while the right hand operates the driver to create throws. The suture is brought down with smooth, controlled approximating force, maintaining edge eversion. With the knot seated and tension balanced across the loop, this adds a third completed simple interrupted suture to the left vertical incision. The tails remain long initially, then are addressed in subsequent frames.

A closely related pass is shown from another angle over the same superior segment: two completed stitches midline are clearly visible, and the next stitch is being placed above them. The driver reloads the needle after clearing the field; the forceps briefly retract to maintain visibility. The steps mirror the prior run—drive the near edge, regrasp, carry the arc to the far side, and draw the suture through. Knot tying proceeds with the left hand controlling the free end to facilitate the throws. This segment reinforces the consistency of technique and confirms the addition of the stitch at the upper portion of the wound.

Short departures to the midline incision; the left line remains unchanged during these moments
The camera again captures the central/midline incision where multiple stitches exist or are being added. At one point, as many as seven completed sutures are visible along that central line. These sequences provide context but are not part of the closure of the left vertical wound. While these midline activities occur, there is no alteration of the stitch count on the left vertical line.

Advancing the superior closure on the left vertical incision
Work resumes at the top of the left vertical incision. Three simple interrupted sutures are already tied along this left wound; a new pass is placed at the superior end. The needle driver is positioned medial/superior to the line, the forceps lateral/superior, their tips opposing across the wound a few millimeters apart. The needle is again held roughly one-third from the swage, perpendicular to the skin. A controlled forehand bite is driven through the near edge, then across, with minimal traction to deliver the needle. Here, the surgeon is meticulous to maintain eversion through delicate lifting rather than by tension on the loop. This pass is completed in the tissue, but knot tying is not yet shown to completion within that short block; the count on the left incision thus remains at three completed sutures at this moment.

Final additions and consolidation; bringing the left incision to four completed sutures
The end of the case consolidates at the superior portion of the same left vertical incision. The left hand (now coming from the upper-left of the field) holds the needle holder in some views, and the right hand intermittently approaches with forceps to stabilize tissue and manage the suture strand. The needle is still grasped at about the proximal third and held perpendicular to the surface as it is aligned for the next pass. The wound edges are presented cleanly with the right hand’s forceps, and the left hand advances the needle through both sides in a smooth arc.

In the final minutes, the surgeon places and ties another simple interrupted stitch at the superior end of the left wound. The left hand’s tissue forceps produce gentle edge eversion; the right hand manipulates the free end during knot tying. Throws are seated carefully, approximating without excess tension. Tails are tensioned and trimmed or laid aside. Across these concluding frames, four simple interrupted sutures are clearly visible along the left vertical incision after the new knot is secured. The hand choreography remains consistent: the driver operates superior and slightly medial to the wound, the forceps on the opposing side just inferior-lateral, and the instruments cross over the line directly above the bite sites during passage and tying.

Hand position evolution and consistency of technique
Over the full procedure, hand roles remain highly consistent despite minor changes in viewpoint and occasional instrument swaps:

- The right hand predominantly carries the needle driver. Grips are deliberately positioned on the proximal third of the needle (approximately two-thirds from the tip), affording a strong lever arm for controlled arcs and perpendicular entry. The surgeon occasionally regrips the needle tip to complete passages through thicker segments before drawing it out.

- The left hand uses Adson/tissue forceps to evert and control edges. When knot tying begins, the left hand often transitions to hold the free end while the right hand’s driver forms instrument throws. During trimming sequences, scissors briefly replace the forceps in the left hand; the right hand stabilizes the knot before cutting.

- Spatially, the driver and forceps oppose each other across the incision, working a few millimeters from the margins, with consistent perpendicular approach to the wound and minimal extraneous traction. Edge eversion is created by lifting dermal tissue, not by cranking on the suture line.

Throughout, the technique remains simple interrupted, exactly as labeled and intended, without deviation to running patterns or mattress configurations. Each stitch is planned to be independent, with precise placement, symmetric depth, and individually tied, enabling spaced approximation along the wound.

Progression of suture count on the left vertical incision
The count on the left vertical incision advances as follows:

- Early phases: multiple needle passes are initiated at the inferior third of the left vertical line with careful bites and edge control, but no knots are completed yet. The stitch count remains at 0.

- After brief interludes elsewhere, the surgeon returns to the left vertical incision with visible progress: two completed simple interrupted sutures are now present. A tightening and trimming sequence is performed around the upper of those two knots. Count: 2.

- The next working sequence at the superior end of the left incision introduces a new stitch. Bites are driven near-to-far with the standard perpendicular arc, then tied via instrument throws. This brings the count to 3 completed sutures.

- A subsequent pass is placed at the top of the left incision; initially, tying is not shown to completion in that short interval, so the visible completed count holds at 3.

- In the final sequences, a stitch is placed and tied at the superior end and the tails managed. By the end of the procedure, four simple interrupted sutures are clearly visible on the left vertical incision.

Final state and verification
By the end of the case, the left vertical wound shows four well-spaced, simple interrupted sutures. Each knot lies perpendicular to the incision line, with short, organized tails. The edges are neatly approximated with slight eversion and without undue blanching, reflecting balanced tension and appropriate bite placement through robust dermal tissue. No undermining is depicted, and there is no manipulation of the right‑side or central wounds in the concluding moments.

Mandatory suture count verification:
- Total number of completed sutures visible on the closed left vertical incision in the final frames: 4.
- The progression on this same line, in order, was 0 at the start; then 2 following the initial completion and trimming; then 3 after the next stitch was placed and tied at the superior segment; and finally 4 once the last superior stitch was placed and secured at the end.
- The final state therefore consists of four completed simple interrupted sutures closing the left vertical incision.

In summary, despite brief digressions in the field of view to other practice wounds, the closure built steadily along the left vertical line with simple interrupted technique. The operator maintained clean, perpendicular needle handling, methodical edge eversion with forceps, and consistent instrument ties. The wound finished with four completed sutures, aligned and evenly spaced, achieving stable approximation across the length addressed in this session.
