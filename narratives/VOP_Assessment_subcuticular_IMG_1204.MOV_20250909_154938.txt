Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
You maintained a consistent working corridor with reliable eversion, even spacing, and steady tension, advancing along a single incision in an organized manner. Instrument choreography was generally efficient, and your tissue handling was mostly gentle, avoiding crush and preserving edge quality. The major deficit is plane integrity for a subcuticular closure. Multiple passes breached the epidermis and traversed across the gap, and knots were left external rather than buried—both inconsistent with a true intradermal run. Correct this by entering at 90 degrees, then flattening the needle to travel horizontally within the dermis; alternate sides at the same dermal depth, keep the suture entirely hidden, and anchor/finish with a buried knot (or an appropriate intradermal termination such as an Aberdeen followed by a bury). Maintain short, symmetric intradermal bites with consistent depth and length, avoid finger‑holding the needle, and limit re‑grips to preserve tissue and efficiency.
