COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad and focuses on closing a single vertical laceration along the right side of the field. From the outset, the operator treats this right‑sided vertical wound as the working site and methodically advances a series of simple interrupted sutures from the lower portion upward, using instrument ties to secure each stitch before moving to the next. The hands and instruments consistently work close to the wound with deliberate spacing and orientation to maintain control of needle trajectory and edge approximation. Across the sequence, occasional camera angle changes and brief views of nearby training slits appear, but the technique and the operator’s attention return repeatedly to the same right‑sided vertical wound, which is the line being progressively closed from inferior to superior.

The opening moments show setup at the lower third of the right vertical slit. The superior/left hand controls a needle driver while the inferior/right hand employs Adson‑type forceps to present the near wound edge. The needle is loaded at the proximal third from the swage with a curve that is aligned to cross the wound perpendicularly. The forceps elevate the near (right) margin gently—enough to align the dermal edge without crushing—and the driver brings the needle to the entry point. The suture tail lies to the right, indicating the operator is about to place the first bite at this lower segment. No passage is yet completed here; it is a careful setup and targeting of the first throw.

Immediately afterward, the needle passes across the gap. The dominant hand, working from above and slightly right of the slit, drives the needle in a controlled arc through the near edge and into the far edge while the non‑dominant hand stabilizes tissue and then gathers the thread. The driver briefly releases and re‑grips the needle to continue the rotation and pull‑through, leaving a tail on one side and a long free end on the other. By the end of this sequence, the operator begins the transition into knot tying, holding the short end with the driver and managing the long strand with the assisting hand to set up for instrument ties. Hands stay on opposite sides of the incision, the driver crossing transversely over the wound to grasp the tail and the assisting hand maintaining tension on the long limb.

When the knot is secured at the lower right of the field, the operator uses the driver itself for instrument ties. The previously placed needle remains parked on the long strand. The driver wraps and grasps the free end, advancing throws down onto the wound with the right hand controlling tension on the long limb. The wound edges at this lower segment come together as the knot is seated centrally over the incision, with the strand traversing laterally to the right as loops are snugged. Tissue is manipulated softly with the suture rather than with heavy forceps, preventing crush injury to the pad’s surface. No new tissue passes occur during this tying sequence; the effort is entirely focused on securing the initial stitch and seating it correctly over the margins.

With the first stitch secure, attention shifts slightly higher on the same long vertical laceration just right of center. The driver, now in the right hand, is oriented perpendicular to the pad, and the left hand alternates between forceps for brief tenting and maintaining suture slack. The needle is positioned over the superior aspect of the same right‑side wound. The assisting hand engages the near edge lightly so the tip can be aligned precisely for entry. This is preparation rather than passage; the operator is gauging bite placement and needle trajectory to keep the bite depth and spacing consistent with the stitch below.

A subsequent sequence shows that a previously placed stitch on the right‑edge slit is being tied off. The needle remains attached to the long strand while the driver is repurposed for instrument ties, consistent with efficient workflow. The left hand, now holding forceps only briefly and then releasing them, allows the right hand to manage the long end. Throws are formed and cinched down to produce a square knot over the wound. This consolidates the closure achieved by the earlier pass and keeps the tails oriented predictably to the right of the slit.

Progressing upward, the operator takes a new bite adjacent to the prior stitch on the same slit. The needle driver, to the right of the wound, holds the needle about one‑third from the swage, with a perpendicular approach. The left hand uses pickups to stabilize and slightly lift the near edge at the chosen entry point. The needle enters and follows a smooth arc through the tissue, and the suture is drawn through, bringing the edges together as the thread is tensioned. Throughout, the hands straddle the wound with clear separation, and the suture is guided purposefully across the incision to avoid snagging and to preserve alignment of the wound margins.

That new stitch is then tied and its tails trimmed. The right hand forms and tightens the throws directly over the slit while the left hand alternates from needle holder to scissors. Once the knot is seated just to the patient’s right of the slit, scissors approach from the superior/left side to cut the tails close to the knot. The right hand steadies the knot and tail to ensure a clean, controlled cut without loosening the throw. Again, the activity remains tightly localized to this same right‑sided vertical wound.

As the closure advances further up the wound, the operator begins placing another stitch above two prior stitches in the mid‑portion of the same slit. The right hand holds the driver and manipulates the needle grasped two‑thirds from the tip for fine control. The left hand uses tissue forceps to stabilize the edge as the needle rotates through in a controlled arc, then assists in re‑gripping the needle mid‑pass to continue the traverse across the wound. Eversion is attempted—visible as a slight rolling of the edges outward during tensioning—though consistency varies a bit as the stitch is drawn through. The suture is passed from one edge across to the opposite, with the thread pulled through in preparation for tying.

Above the lower half, the operator places and ties yet another stitch, working just superior to the earlier closures. The left hand, now wielding the driver to grasp the shorter end for instrument ties, alternates with the right hand on forceps to hold the long limb and, when needed, to evert the far edge gently. Throws are advanced and seated squarely over the wound so that the knot lies centrally, and the edges come together evenly. This continues the rhythm of bite, pull‑through, and tie, all the while maintaining parallel hand positioning along the incision so that the driver crosses the wound only when needed to grasp a tail.

There follows a brief interlude in which the camera shows a short horizontal cut on the right half of the pad with activity at its right end. The same instrument tie mechanics—perpendicular driver orientation, loop control by the opposite hand, and reloading the needle to initiate the next bite slightly leftward—appear here as well. Because the remainder of the session returns to and completes the vertical right‑sided wound, and because no further progression continues along this horizontal slit, this brief view likely reflects a short check or demonstration on an adjacent practice slit captured in the frame rather than a true change of focus. The core closure continues on the vertical laceration.

The work then returns to the vertical incision in the right‑central portion of the pad, which by now has a short row of simple stitches in its midsection. The dominant hand approaches from the right with the driver; the other hand is mostly off frame but occasionally steadies the tissue. The curved needle is grasped roughly two‑thirds from the tip, aligned almost perpendicular to the surface, and positioned to take the next bite a few millimeters above the most superior existing stitch. The driver tip and fingertips provide counter‑tension to present the near edge. No knot tying is shown at this moment—it is a precise setup for the next pass, maintaining the stepwise march up the wound.

That stitch is then executed and secured. The right hand, with the driver, drives the needle across and the left hand, with forceps, elevates each edge in turn to control bite depth and produce some edge eversion. Symmetric bites at equal distances from the margin are taken through the simulated dermis and subdermis, and the suture is tightened down. Instrument ties are performed to secure the new stitch, and scissors appear briefly in the right hand to trim the tails. This increases the number of completed stitches along the same vertical incision and positions the operator to continue superiorly.

Near the upper portion of the rightmost slit, another stitch is tied. The driver is again used for instrument throws while the assisting hand manages the free limb and forms the loops. Gentle traction is maintained to hold apposition while the throws are cinched and seated. At times, a brief appearance of forceps helps control the strand near the wound. After securing the knot, the needle is reloaded in preparation for the next potential pass, even as prior knots remain undisturbed and well seated. The operator’s movements continue to straddle the wound line, with the driver operating just to the right and the assisting hand drawing the strand across the axis to set tension.

With the core row in place, the operator turns to housekeeping—trimming tag ends on the recently tied knots along the right‑central vertical incision. The right hand initially holds a needle holder above the wound but does not pass the needle here; instead, the holder is set aside and scissors are used to cut tails. The working hand crosses over the incision to access each knot, approaching within a few millimeters to trim the ends neatly and short, producing a tidy row of knots with minimal excess suture. No new stitches are placed in this segment, and the wound edges appear well approximated along the closed segments.

The final phase is a tactile inspection. The right index finger, in a green glove, approaches from the lateral side and palpates along the stitch line. The fingertip briefly contacts the knots and edges, checking for even tension and alignment. Initially, there is slight gapping noted near the superior end compared with the more tightly approximated mid‑portion; this is a common finding where the final stitch has not been placed or where spacing is slightly wider at the top. No contralateral hand provides counter‑traction during this assessment; no needle or driver is present. The finger then traces the line again, hovering near the upper stitches and scanning down to the lower segment. Edges remain aligned by the existing stitches, and a small residual gap is seen near the lower end as well—subtle and much smaller than the original defect but visible on close inspection. Throughout this assessment, no new bites are placed; it is purely a quality check of the completed closure.

Across the entire sequence, the technique remains consistent with simple interrupted closure of the same right‑sided vertical wound. The operator repeatedly loads the curved needle in the driver at the proximal third to mid‑shaft for control, approaches the wound perpendicularly, and rotates through each edge in a controlled arc. Forceps are used judiciously to stabilize and evert the margins—sometimes only lightly touching the near edge to avoid crush—and are set aside during knot tying. Instrument ties are the standard method for securing each stitch: the driver grasps the short end, the opposite hand tensions the long limb, loops are formed and advanced deliberately down onto the wound, and the knot is seated squarely. The suture loop is kept lateral to the right of the incision to avoid entanglement, and the operator alternates hand dominance across the wound as needed for the reciprocal bite. When a knot is secure, the scissors approach from the side that offers the most control—often superior/left—while the other hand steadies the knot and tail for a precise cut.

Spatially, the hands and instruments remain parallel to the wound for the majority of the passes, with the driver crossing over the incision line only when necessary to grasp a tail or complete a pass. During needle passage, the driver typically works on the near/right side while the assisting hand stabilizes the far/left side; during the reciprocal bite these roles switch to maintain symmetry. When tying, the driver and assisting hand briefly cross above the incision but keep the loop lateral and away from the tissue to avoid cinching the loop prematurely against the skin. The operator advances in small increments along the wound, keeping spacing and depth of bites consistent with the underlying dermal thickness of the pad.

The evolution of hand use demonstrates increasing efficiency. Early on, the left hand uses forceps frequently to lift and present edges. As the operator progresses, finer control with the driver tip and fingers provides sufficient counter‑tension for entry, with the forceps coming in primarily for precise eversion at the moment of the bite. The needle is parked safely during tying, then reloaded quickly for the next pass. Tensioning is measured; the operator avoids over‑tightening that could blanch the synthetic tissue or invert the edges, aiming instead for gentle eversion and flush apposition. The few moments where eversion is noted to be attempted but not fully maintained are corrected as the throws are seated and tension is balanced.

By the time the row is complete, there is a neat sequence of interrupted knots along the right‑central vertical incision, with short tails trimmed uniformly and knots resting slightly toward the right side of the wound where the tying hand controlled the long strand. The lower and mid segments are well opposed; at the ends there is a hint of residual gapping—first seen superiorly during palpation and later a small gap perceived inferiorly—suggesting that one more stitch at either extremity or a minor adjustment of spacing could eliminate the last bit of separation. Nevertheless, the overall closure is secure and orderly, with consistent bite depth and spacing, cleanly seated instrument ties, and preserved alignment of the wound margins along the entire length that was addressed. The final inspection confirms that the suture line is stable, the knots are snug without strangulation, and the wound is ready for dressing or for the placement of an additional terminal stitch if the operator elects to fine‑tune the small residual gap noted during the final assessment.
