Pattern: Simple Interrupted

1. Perpendicular needle passes 2/5 developing
Needle was consistently loaded on the mid–proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the skin, but no actual passes were executed to show right-angle entry/exit or symmetric bites. Without demonstrated bites, this element falls below standard.

2. Gentle tissue handling 4/5 proficient
Forceps use was minimal and gentle, providing slight edge elevation without repeated pinching or crushing. This reflects careful tissue handling beyond basic competency.

3. Square, secure knots 4/5 proficient
Instrument ties alternated direction, loops were controlled off the skin, and knots were seated flat with steady, opposing horizontal traction while the needle was safely parked. The resulting knot stacks are square and secure, appropriate for clinical reliability.

4. Appropriate approximation/tension 4/5 proficient
Edges were brought together smoothly with no blanching, gaping, or puckering, and knots were centered over the wound after tightening. Tension control achieved precise approximation.

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm) 2/5 developing
Sutures were placed along one incision without an evident plan for consistent intervals, and the line reads as opportunistic rather than uniformly spaced. Lack of standardized 0.5–1.0 cm spacing keeps this below standard.

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable) 4/5 proficient
The closed incision displays flat to slight eversion and no inversion, achieved without aggressive manipulation. Edge profile meets expectations and supports optimal healing.

7. Economy of time and motion 2/5 developing
Frequent off-field pauses, tool reloading without proceeding to a pass, and multiple role/instrument swaps interrupt the workflow. These inefficiencies reduce economy of motion despite otherwise organized knot handling.

Summative assessment:
Your knot-tying mechanics are deliberate and consistent, with disciplined loop control, alternation of throws, and safe needle parking; this shows good ambidexterity and composure at the field. However, the overall flow is halting due to repeated resets and prolonged tying sequences that are not followed by immediate progression to the next stitch, which disrupts rhythm and efficiency.

Most importantly, the core of simple interrupted suturing—driving the needle in a smooth, wrist‑led arc at 90 degrees with symmetric, equal‑depth bites and planned spacing—was not demonstrated. Your next step is to execute complete stitches end‑to‑end: plan the line, place matched bites 3–5 mm from the edge with a true right‑angle entry/exit, maintain 0.5–1.0 cm spacing, minimize instrument swaps and off‑field movements, and after each secure, flat knot, cut tails appropriately and move directly to the next pass. Build a continuous cadence: load, pass, retrieve, tie, cut, reload—no idle phases.
