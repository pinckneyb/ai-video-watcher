Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your needle control, perpendicular entries, and mirrored bites show foundational technical ability, and the knots you tied are square and secure. However, this is not a subcuticular closure: the bites repeatedly transgress the epidermis and knots sit on the incision line. A subcuticular repair requires a continuous intradermal path with buried or off‑line knots and no epidermal punctures; that standard was not met. Surface contour reflects this, with focal ridging rather than a flat, cosmetically precise line. Remediate as follows: anchor with a buried intradermal knot, then run strictly within the dermis 2–3 mm below the epidermis, taking symmetric 5–7 mm bites that exit and re‑enter at the same dermal level on opposite sides. Maintain gentle, single-tip eversion grasps per bite, advance in a steady rhythm without leaving the plane, and keep steady, incremental tension to lay a flat line. Finish by burying the terminal knot or tying to the initial tail off‑line and burying it. Pre‑load the needle and minimize regrips to tighten economy of motion.
