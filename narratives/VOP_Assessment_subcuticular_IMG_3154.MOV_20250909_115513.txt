Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
This performance does not meet subcuticular standards. The active incision was closed using transcutaneous simple‑interrupted stitches with multiple epidermal punctures and external knots, rather than a continuous intradermal track. The surface result predictably shows dimpling and mild ridging, not the flat approximation required of a subcuticular closure. There are positives: needle control is stable, entries are perpendicular with reasonable bilateral symmetry, and tissue handling is gentle with square instrument ties. To achieve a true subcuticular repair, start with a buried dermal anchor, keep the needle nearly parallel to the skin, and advance in the dermis just deep to the epidermis with equal 5–7 mm bites that mirror the prior exit. Maintain consistent depth, light tension to avoid ridging, and finish with a buried/aberrdeen termination or lateral tie off the line. Stay with one wound, minimize regrasping, and convert each motion into forward progress.
