Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Plane integrity was not maintained in the subcuticular layer. The closure relies on transcutaneous passes with external knots, producing epidermal punctures and surface dimpling rather than a continuous intradermal track. Although bite spacing is reasonably symmetric and needle entry is orthogonal, the end result lacks the flat, linear approximation expected of a subcuticular line. Your hand coordination and tissue respect are acceptable, but you must commit to the intradermal plane: start with a buried anchor, take shallow, symmetric bites within the dermis 3â€“5 mm from the edge, advance in consistent increments, and avoid exiting the epidermis. Maintain gentle, steady traction to lay a smooth line and finish with a buried or lateral off-line knot without disturbing edge alignment.
