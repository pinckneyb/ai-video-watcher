Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion and flow are disciplined: consistent needle loading, near-perpendicular arc-following, and a steady interrupted cadence with efficient switches to instrument ties. Instrument handling is economicalâ€”hands stay in the box, the needle is parked thoughtfully, loops are laid flat, and knots are centered without unnecessary tissue lift. This is competent, clean work with smooth rhythm and good two-hand coordination.
