Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Perpendicular needle passes: The needle is consistently loaded at the mid‑body or one‑third from the swage and presented square to the skin, with deliberate re‑grips to maintain a right‑angle approach; passes appear symmetric with minimal shear. This meets standard but lacks the crisp, decisive follow‑through that would demonstrate mastery.

Gentle tissue handling: Tissue is handled atraumatically with sparing, precise use of fine pickups and reliance on suture tension for approximation, avoiding repeated or crushing grasps. This reflects consistently gentle handling above baseline expectations.

Square, secure knots: Throws alternate reliably and are seated flat with balanced opposing traction, producing compact square knots with short, tidy tails. Knot control and security are consistently good.

Appropriate approximation/tension: Wound edges are brought together without gapping, but the slight puckering along the line indicates intermittent over‑tension. This is adequate closure but not yet optimal tension modulation.

Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm): The completed segments show regularly spaced stitches with consistent intervals and orientation. Planning and execution of spacing exceed basic competency.

Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable): Edges are approximated primarily by suture tension without deliberate forceps‑assisted eversion, yielding a generally flat profile without clear inversion. This meets standard but lacks intentional, reproducible eversion.

Economy of time and motion: Hands and instruments remain near the field with methodical limb management and safe needle lateralization, though repeated re‑grips and staging steps introduce avoidable motions. Efficiency is solid but could be sharper.

Summative assessment:
The sequence shows a deliberate, organized rhythm—load, present, tension, tie, trim, reload—with consistent control of the long and short limbs and safe needle lateralization during tying. Instrument ties and hand ties are performed with steady cadence and appropriate post control, reflecting confidence and good suture stewardship. Overall motion is calm and controlled, and the field remains tidy with planned use of parked clamps and short knot tails.

To elevate this from solid to standout, reduce unnecessary re‑gripping and commit to the pass once alignment is achieved, maintaining a smooth, continuous arc through tissue. Add deliberate, consistent edge support with fine pickups to produce intentional eversion, and soften traction just enough to eliminate the mild puckering while preserving precise approximation. These refinements will increase efficiency, improve wound edge architecture, and bring the technique to a truly high‑level standard.
