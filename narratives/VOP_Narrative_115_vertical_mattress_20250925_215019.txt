COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The case documents a single linear skin closure on a practice silicone skin pad — a vertical midline incision that sits slightly to the right of the geometric center of the pad. From the first to the last frame the operator consistently works along that same incision line (most frames focused on the right-hand column of the central midline wound), sequentially placing and securing individual skin bites to re-approximate the epidermal/dermal edges. The remainder of this narrative follows the entire temporal progression: instrument grips and needle handling, tissue manipulation and edge apposition, sequential placement and tying of stitches, hand and instrument relationships, and the final, completed closure. Where observations in a few frames suggest a continuous running element, that is noted as a discrepancy in the images; the procedural intent and dominant technique throughout is placement of individual interrupted skin sutures.

Initial approach and preparation (0–60 s)
Work begins at an inferior gap in a line of already-placed interrupted sutures. The incision shows a central column of stitches with a small unstented portion at the inferior end; the operator approaches that gap with standard instrument pairing. The dominant hand holds a needle driver and the non-dominant hand holds thumb/tissue forceps or a small clamp/hemostat to present and stabilize the tissue and the suture tail. The curved suture needle is typically grasped in the driver near the mid-shaft (often two-thirds toward the body or at the proximal-to-mid portion of the curve), allowing controlled rotation through a curved arc. The needle tip is directed downwards toward the wound as the instrument is brought perpendicular or slightly oblique to the incision to take a full-thickness superficial bite through the synthetic dermis. Forceps on the opposite side gently present and evert the wound margin to produce close edge apposition when the needle exits. Once the needle is externalized, suture tails are managed with a hemostat and tied with instrument and hand-assisted throws; following tying, excess suture is trimmed in several frames.

Sequential interrupted placement and early technique consistency (60–180 s)
As the procedure progresses upward along the incision, the operator continues placing additional interrupted sutures just adjacent to prior bites. Across multiple time segments the working pattern is consistent: the needle driver approaches from above or above-left of the wound, the tissue forceps come in from the right or lateral aspect to stabilize the near edge and control the externalized suture limb. The grasp point on the needle is steady — near the body or mid-shaft to control curvature and arc, not at the very tip — and the needle is rotated through the tissue in short, controlled arcs to exit the opposing edge. Bites are placed close to the wound margin (skin-to-skin approximation) and are taken through the superficial dermal layer of the synthetic model; the sutures are placed with slight eversion of the edges in order to favor proper edge apposition once knots are secured. The assistant instrument (hemostat or thumb forceps) often secures the suture tail and provides counter-traction during tying.

Hand positions remain compact and coordinated, usually within 2–4 cm of one another. The dominant driver occupies a position over or slightly medial-to-superior relative to the bite being made; the non-dominant instrument supports the lateral or inferior aspect. Instrument crossing over the incision is common when receiving the needle or during knot-tying steps. The operator alternates between passing the needle, pulling the suture through, hand-assisted knot-tying with the hemostat/forceps as an assistant, and trimming suture tails — a systematic interrupted-suture workflow.

Extension of the stitch series and occasional adjunct maneuvers (120–300 s)
Work continues steadily along the midline-right column of stitches. The operator fills gaps between previously placed bites, placing additional interrupted sutures both cranially and caudally from the initial inferior site. Several frames show the operator managing suture tails with a long hemostat while the needle driver completes the next pass; this handoff pattern repeats as the row of interrupted stitches is extended. Needle orientation varies slightly depending on the bite: sometimes the driver approaches perpendicular-to-oblique, sometimes at a shallow angle to control tip trajectory through the thin synthetic dermis. The tissue forceps are used intermittently to lift and evert the near edge, and occasional finger pressure (light fingertip compression) is used to stabilize and press opposing edges into apposition while tightening the knot.

There are moments where the operator pauses with hands off-frame and instruments resting near the pad, but the overarching activity returns to picking up the needle and placing the next interrupted stitch. Knot-forming technique is consistent: instrument ties and simple throws are used to secure each individual stitch before trimming the tails. When tying, the assistant instrument frequently functions as a posts to secure the suture limb and protect previously placed stitches.

Concentration on the right column and minor deviations (300–420 s)
The operator’s attention remains fixed on the right-side column of the central incision. At times both hands approach the wound from the right side of the pad, with the dominant hand controlling the needle and the non-dominant hand stabilizing tissue and suture material. The needle driver grip is steady, typically at the mid-shaft or proximal third, facilitating a controlled arc that passes the curved needle cleanly through the synthetic tissue. Edge eversion is visible at most bites; care is taken to produce symmetric bites on both sides of the incision so that the skin margins align closely when the knot is secured.

During this middle stage, several frames show finishing maneuvers on earlier stitches: adjusting tension, final tightening of knots, and trimming of tails. In some images, the operator appears to manipulate a looped suture tail and to prepare for the next knot; in others, suture tails are held externally and readied for instrument ties. These sequences emphasize the stepwise interrupted-suture approach — pass, retrieve, tie, cut — repeated down the length of the wound column.

Apparent discrepancies in a few frames (420–560 s)
Most frames show clear interrupted-suture technique, but a handful of frames later in the recording describe a long suture tail and the progression of a running/continuous closure along the right column. This creates a discrepancy in the visual record. Notwithstanding those moments where a continuous element is visible (a long suture tail and sequential passes using an external tail to advance closure), the prevailing, consistent operative pattern before and after these frames remains individual interrupted bites with tying and trimming. It is possible that the model’s long suture tail or instrument handling produced a transient appearance of continuity, or that an interim running pass was used in an attempt to expedite closure of a small segment, but the operator returns to and chiefly employs interrupted bites through the timeline. The narrative continues to interpret the procedure as focused on placement of discrete interrupted sutures despite occasional frames that hint at continuous suture handling; those instances are noted as departures from the dominant interrupted technique.

Refinement and finishing passes (560–590 s)
As the session approaches its end, the operator finishes the remaining unstitched segments of the same midline-right incision column. Final passes are made with the same needle-driver grip and rotation technique; the non-dominant hand maintains counter-traction and controls suture tails for tying. In several later frames both hands are absent or instruments lie idle near the pad, evidence that active needle work has ceased and the final knots have been completed and trimmed. Wound edges along the treated column are consistently approximated with minimal residual gapping. Slight eversion is present at many bites, a common technique to offset tissue retraction and favor epidermal edge alignment.

Instrument and hand choreography throughout
Across the entire procedure the choreography between hands and instruments is highly coordinated. The operator typically places the needle with the dominant hand using a needle driver, while the non-dominant hand uses thumb forceps or a hemostat to present the edge, control the trailing suture limb, and perform instrument or hand-assisted ties. The driver approaches from variable quadrants — above/left, above/center, or from the top of the frame — depending on the bite location; the assistant instrument usually approaches from the lateral-right or inferior aspect of the incision. Distances between instrument tips remain compact (commonly 1–4 cm), facilitating accurate needle trajectory, immediate suture retrieval, and efficient knot-tying. Occasional changes in relative hand position reflect shifts along the vertical axis of the wound as the operator moves from inferior to superior bites (and vice versa), but the same two-handed rhythm is preserved.

Tissue handling, bite depth, and approximation quality
Every pass targets the superficial dermal/epidermal zone of the synthetic model. Bites are taken close to the wound edge to achieve skin-to-skin contact, and the operator consistently manages slight eversion of the margins so that final epidermal edges sit flush when the knots are secured. The synthetic pad limits tissue realism — the material’s handling, puncture resistance, and recoil differ from live tissue — and that constraint is visible in some frames where suture spacing varies slightly or where the operator adjusts technique to compensate for the model. Nevertheless, the placement pattern remains regular and methodical: individual stitches spaced along the incision in a row, each tied and trimmed before proceeding to the next.

Final assessment and closure state
By the end of the recording the full length of the targeted right-side column of the central midline incision has been secured. Wound edges are approximated, knots are present at each bite and tails have been trimmed in the later frames where instruments are idle beside the pad. The overall closure shows uniformity in bite location and orientation, with modest edge eversion that indicates intentional approximation technique. A few frames earlier in the sequence showed instrument rest and temporary absence of hands, confirming completion of active stitching. While a minority of frames suggested the presence of a continuous suture tail or sequential passes resembling a running technique, the predominant, consistent approach throughout remains placement of individual interrupted skin sutures with routine instrument-mediated tying and trimming.

Summary
The procedure is a deliberate, reproducible closure of a single vertical midline incision (the right-hand column of the central wound on the pad) using a consistent interrupted-suture workflow. The operator repeatedly employs a needle driver grasping the curved needle near its mid-shaft, passes the needle through opposing epidermal/dermal margins with controlled rotation, uses forceps or a hemostat to evert and stabilize the near edge and to control suture limbs, ties instrument- or hand-assisted throws to secure individual stitches, and trims tails before proceeding to the next bite. Hands and instruments maintain a close working geometry, typically within a few centimeters of one another, and choreography is stable across the recording. Some frames display minor deviations (apparent running suture segments or temporary instrument rests) and the synthetic model introduces limitations in tissue realism and occasional variability in suture spacing, but the operative progression is clear: the single midline incision is systematically closed along its length via sequential interrupted sutures to a final state of well-approximated skin edges with secured knots and trimmed suture tails.
