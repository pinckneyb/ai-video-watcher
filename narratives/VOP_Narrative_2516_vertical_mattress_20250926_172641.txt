COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the practitioner focused on a short skin defect in the upper-left quadrant of the pad. From the outset the approach is consistent and methodical: the right (dominant) hand controls a needle driver while the left hand uses fine toothed forceps or fingertip stabilization to evert and steady the opposing edge. The incision is shallow, a short linear/curvilinear defect near the pad’s top edge, and it is gradually closed by sequential placement of simple interrupted stitches performed in a stepwise, repetitive pattern. Other incisions elsewhere on the pad appear with previously placed sutures and serve as visual context, but the visible work throughout the recording is concentrated at this single left-sided wound.

Initial passes (0–44 s)
In the first frames the operator identifies the wound and establishes a consistent working posture: hands remain close together, typically within a few centimeters of one another, with the needle driver approaching from a slightly superior-lateral vector and the forceps (or fingertips) anchoring the opposite side. The curved, swaged needle is routinely grasped in the jaws of the driver at or near the mid‑shaft — not at the very tip but far enough along the curve to provide mechanical control for a smooth arc. Needle orientation is almost always perpendicular to the skin surface or slightly oblique, ensuring controlled perpendicular entry and exit points on each edge. The assistant hand elevates and everts the near edge a small amount so that bites capture dermis and produce a slight outward roll when approximated.

During these early passes the technique is textbook simple interrupted closure: small, shallow dermal bites are taken through epidermis/dermis without deep tissue dissection. The driver advances in short controlled arcs, rotating along the needle curvature to direct the tip through tissue. The left-hand forceps provide opposing traction and alignment so that the needle consistently engages full-thickness dermal tissue on the opposite margin. After passage, the suture is pulled through gently, and the hands momentarily adjust to prepare for a tying sequence — although in many frames the actual knot throws take place off-frame or are deferred; the emphasis here is steady placement of accurately spaced bites.

Progress through the mid-portion (45–149 s)
As the work advances, the operator continues serial placement from the cranial/apical portion of the incision progressing caudally or vice versa depending on local orientation, following a linear pattern along the defect. Hand positions remain tightly coordinated: the needle driver continues to come from above or lateral to the incision while the tissue-holding forceps approach from medial or inferior directions. The grip point on the needle remains relatively stable — commonly mid‑shaft to proximal third — allowing the driver to maintain control through the curve and minimize sudden tip deflections. Where needed the surgeon briefly repositions the grip toward the needle body to draw the tip through the final few millimeters of dense simulated dermis.

Tissue handling is consistently atraumatic; forceps are used to lift only the amount of skin needed to create a clean eversion and bite, avoiding crushing or excessive traction. The needle passes are small and measured, capturing superficial dermis rather than plunging deep into subcutaneous analogs. Approximation after each passage demonstrates controlled tensioning of the suture so the wound edges come into close apposition with a slight eversion — a deliberate technique to enhance epidermal edge coaptation when tied. At times the left hand also uses fingertip pressure to steady the pad and adjust wound alignment as the right hand maneuvers the needle.

Mid-sequence refinement and occasional tying (150–209 s)
As the operator continues, small refinements in technique are evident. Needle grips are sometimes shifted marginally toward the swaged end when withdrawing the needle or when removing it after completing a pass; this facilitates smooth handoff and withdrawal without snagging the tissue. At points the left hand uses a toothed Adson-style forceps to maintain a firmer tenting of the edge — particularly at curved portions or at the apex of the incision — to guide the arc of the needle and prevent inadvertent slippage. Coordination between both hands remains tight; instruments approach at converging angles so that the needle tip passes through the opposing edge in a nearly perpendicular fashion.

Several frames show the surgeon pulling the suture through and preparing the limbs for knot-tying; although detailed knot-throw choreography is not always visible within a single set of frames, the pattern is clear: passage, gentle tensioning to approximate edges, preparation of the suture limbs, and either tying or holding the suture for later securement. When knotting is performed the operator appears to use standard instrument ties, maintaining short, controlled throws and then trimming the tails as necessary. Throughout this interval the spacing between stitches is kept consistent, producing an evenly approximated wound line without puckering.

Working around curvature and apex points (210–299 s)
The upper-left defect includes a short curved/transverse portion near its apex; the operator adjusts approach vectors appropriately. At curved segments the needle driver sometimes approaches slightly more medially or from an altered cranio-caudal angle to line up the needle arc with the tissue curvature. The left-hand stabilizing instrument may move more laterally to evert the far edge and expose a clean bite zone. Needle grasping remains mid-shaft in order to negotiate the curvature and to prevent the tip from skiving along the surface.

Passing through apex points requires tighter coordination: the instrument-bearing hand advances the needle in a controlled arc while the stabilizing hand provides counter-traction and slight eversion to create perpendicular entry. After each bite through the apex, the suture is drawn through and tensioned so the edges come into smooth apposition despite the curve; the result is a series of interrupted stitches that follow the curve without tension bands or focal puckering. Thread management is also steady — suture tails are kept clear of the working zone and occasionally gripped briefly by fingers to prevent entanglement while the next pass is readied.

Late-sequence adjustments and completion maneuvers (300–328 s)
Approaching the end of the closure sequence, the operator consistently returns to the superior/most cranial portion of the left incision to finish the final bites. Needle grips, orientation, and bite depth remain aligned with prior practice: mid-shaft apprehension of the curved needle, perpendicular-to-oblique trajectories for entry, and light eversion from the forceps. Hands remain in close proximity — typically within a handspan or less — and the right-hand driver advances and withdraws the needle in short, controlled arcs. The left-hand everts and steadies the tissue while simultaneously organizing suture limbs.

Where knot-tying or final trimming is visible, it follows predictable instrument-tying technique: the surgeon forms the throws with the driver while the forceps maintain suture tension and prevent torsion at the wound edges. After securement, the tails are trimmed with fine scissors or clipped and the completed stitch is smoothed to sit flush with the adjacent interrupted bites.

Throughout the final stages the practitioner continually monitors edge apposition: minor adjustments are made to suture tension to equalize approximation and preserve the slight deliberate eversion that promotes epidermal edge contact. The final passes at the apex and along the linear portion ensure an even distribution of stitches and consistent spacing, producing a uniform, atraumatic closure.

Consistency, evolution, and bimanual coordination
Throughout the entire sequence the technique remains consistent in its core principles: a simple interrupted pattern, small dermal bites, mid‑shaft needle grip, perpendicular entry and exit, and slight eversion of the epidermal edges. The suturing remains focused on the superficial dermis and epidermis of the pad model rather than pursuing deep-layer anchoring. Minor variations occur due to local anatomy of the incision — curved versus linear segments — and the surgeon adapts approach angles and stabilizing hand positions accordingly. Hand positions evolve subtly but predictably: the needle driver usually approaches from above or lateral to the wound and may rotate cranially or caudally around curved areas, while the stabilizing hand alternates between Adson-style forceps and fingertip control for the most precise eversion and counter-traction.

Instrument-to-tissue spatial relationships are steady: jaws and tips converge at the bite site, the forces applied are gentle, and instruments rarely cross outside the immediate working envelope. The operator routinely repositions the needle holder along the needle curve as needed to maintain control and to draw the tip through dense tissue without skiving. Suture handling and thread management are disciplined — tails are controlled between passes, and the workspace is kept clear so each new bite can be placed without entanglement.

Final appearance and wound status
By the conclusion the incision in the upper-left quadrant is uniformly approximated with sequential interrupted stitches spaced evenly along the length of the wound. Each bite produces slight eversion of the epidermal margins, yielding a clean ridge of tissue along the suture line that will allow epidermal edges to evert slightly as the wound heals. There is no evidence of gross gaping, puckering, or undue tissue bunching; instrument handling remained atraumatic throughout.

Although some frames elsewhere on the pad show previously placed sutures or manipulation of other incisions, the recorded work is concentrated on this one left-sided defect and demonstrates a controlled, methodical simple interrupted closure. The final state is a well-approximated, evenly sutured incision with neatly aligned edges, consistent bite depth, and tidy suture management — reflecting repeated, disciplined application of standard interrupted skin closure technique from start to finish.
