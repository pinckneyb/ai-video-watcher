COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on the central, midline vertical incision of the training pad. From the first frames to the end, all instrument activity, tissue handling and suture work is focused on that single central slit, progressing along its length from the inferior segment upward toward the superior apex. The team consistently uses a curved, swaged needle and fine instruments (needle driver(s), Adson/toothed forceps or pickups, occasional second driver for instrument ties) throughout; the narrative below follows the continuous progression of the closure, describing how each bite is taken, how knots are formed and how the hands move and trade roles to produce an even approximation.

Initial placement and knotting at the lower end
The case begins with the operator preparing and placing a stitch at the lower end of the central incision. The needle is typically grasped in the driver about two‑thirds to the proximal third of the needle and is oriented nearly perpendicular to the pad surface. The right‑hand forceps evert and stabilize the near wound edge while the left‑hand driver advances the needle across the wound in a controlled rotational arc; the tip exits the opposite edge near the dermal plane. After passage the needle is parked out of the wound and instrument ties are used to secure the stitch centrally over the incision. Multiple frames show successive instrument ties: the driver forms loops, the opposite instrument controls the short limb, and throws are cinched down to seat the knot on the epidermal surface. During these early sequences, the free ends are kept separated (long limb cephalad/right, short tail medial/left or inferior) and tension is opposed by hands on either side to maintain apposition without gapping. The suturing at this stage is careful and methodical: forceps provide gentle eversion, bite depth is dermal/subdermal, and the knot is centered on the incision.

Establishing the anchor and beginning the running line
Following the initial securement, the operator transitions into placing successive stitches adjacent to that anchor. In several sequences a new stitch is placed slightly superior to the prior knot: the needle is reloaded in the driver (grips vary from proximal third to mid‑body depending on the frame), presented from the left side across to the right, and driven through symmetric dermal bites aligned with the pad’s reference dots. Forceps consistently evert the far edge to expose the dermis before needle entry and to protect tissue from crushing. After each pass the suture is pulled through, slack is drawn out and tension adjusted so the edges lie slightly everted and closely approximated. Several frames show an instrument tie being performed to lock a pass or secure the line temporarily; in other frames the needle is immediately reloaded and another bite is taken, demonstrating a transition to a continuous progression along the midline.

Progression of the continuous closure, inferior-to-superior
Once the anchor and first few stitches are established, the procedure proceeds as a continuous closure advancing cranially. The needle driver and forceps work in opposition across the wound: usually the driver approaches from the operator’s left, carrying the needle and crossing the midline to exit at the right edge, while the forceps on the right present and evert the edge for a clean dermal bite. The needle is repeatedly grasped at approximately the proximal third (sometimes regrasped nearer the tip when needed), oriented perpendicular to the skin, and driven in smooth arcs that follow the needle curvature. After each pass the instrument regrips the needle to complete the arc and pulls the suture through, and the assistant hand draws the slack cephalad and maintains even tension so that each bite snugly approximates the edges. This pattern is repeated in adjacent frames as the suture line is extended upward.

Throughout this running sequence the team shows a high level of spatial control: the needle driver works close to the wound (millimeters from the edge), the forceps remain just lateral to the bite, and hands cross over or trade positions as necessary to maintain symmetry—sometimes the driver moves slightly right-of‑center when securing a bite, while the opposing hand briefly becomes the primary manipulator of the suture tail. The suture strand is intentionally kept out of the operative window (trailed superiorly and to the right in many frames) during passes so it does not obscure the needle path. When a pass is completed, the strand is tensioned centrally to preserve consistent edge apposition and slight eversion along the closure.

Locking behavior and instrument ties
Although the overall movement is continuous, occasional frames show locking behavior or instrument ties being used to secure the strand at particular points. In several superior segments, the loop is pulled and a locking turn or cinch is formed—often described in the frames as “locking” or “forming a loop”—and then instrument ties are executed with the driver and a second instrument to seat the knot. The team alternates between using forceps and a second needle driver to form square instrument throws; sometimes the needle is parked while instrument ties are performed on the long limb. These intermittent ties act as anchor points within the running line, holding incremental tension and preventing loosening while the run continues superiorly.

Needle handling nuances and regrasping
Needle handling is consistent but adaptive. The surgeon usually grasps the needle roughly one‑third from the swage for optimal curvature control; in passages that require fine angle adjustment the needle is regrasped nearer the tip to facilitate the final arc and exit. Wrist rotation is used to carry the needle through dermis rather than pushing straight—this wheel‑like motion ensures smooth passage. Between bites the driver sometimes parks the needle to allow instrument ties or knot‑seating maneuvers, and in frames showing tying the driver may grasp suture rather than needle to create loops. The needle is periodically retrieved by the forceps when the tip emerges on the far side, then reloaded for the next pass.

Tissue handling and eversion throughout the run
On every bite the non‑dominant instrument (usually Adson or toothed pickups) elevates and everts the wound edge to expose the dermis and present a predictable exit point. Bite depth is consistently dermal/subdermal and placed a few millimeters from the epidermal margin to produce slight eversion—this helps the epidermis meet when the line is fully approximated and reduces inversion. Throughout the procedure there is attention to avoiding crushing; forceps tips are used delicately to present tissue rather than to straddle or traumatize it. When tensioning each new pass, the surgeon adjusts to maintain even edge apposition and minimize puckering, although a modest central puckering is visible in later frames consistent with a snug running closure.

Hand position evolution and role switching
Hand positions evolve smoothly as the run progresses. Early on, the driver approaches from the upper‑left or left side to place the first stitches and then withdraws to perform instrument ties while the opposite hand holds the free tail. As the running closure advances, the primary driver remains on the left and the forceps on the right, opposing each other across the incision. Periodically, the roles reverse briefly—the left hand may take up forceps to present tissue while the right hand regrips the driver for a pass or instrument tie. At times two drivers are used: one to manipulate the needle/standing end and another to perform instrument ties. Toward the superior apex, drives and forceps converge closely, working only millimeters from the wound, then relax outward when knots are secured and instruments are withdrawn.

Consistency of technique and minor inconsistencies
Overall technique is consistent: perpendicular needle orientation, symmetric dermal bites, systematic eversion, regrasping as needed, and controlled tensioning of each pass. The operator demonstrates a rhythmic pattern of pass‑pull‑tension‑repeat that advances the closure cranially. There are, however, minor variations across frames that reflect normal intra‑procedural adjustments: sometimes a stitch is completed and then tied as an interrupted stitch (frames early in the sequence show discrete interrupted placement and instrument‑tying sequences), while in other stretches a clearly running/locked pattern is seen advancing without immediate knot tying. These differences appear intermittently and are reconciled by the overall direction of the procedure—progressive, sequential bites advancing the closure—often with intermittent instrument ties to secure portions of the line. In a few frames no forceps are used during final tensioning, but hands remain positioned to stabilize the pad and ensure the line stays snug.

Spatial choreography: instruments relative to the wound
Spatially, the instruments maintain a tight working triangle centered on the wound: driver left, forceps right, suture tail drawn superiorly and laterally to avoid tangling. When the needle is in transit it crosses the midline; when tying occurs the instruments cross above the wound to form loops and retrieve the short limb. After each pass, the driver and forceps alternate sides slightly to present the best line for the next bite. As the closure approaches the top, instruments work in a more compact field near the superior apex where the prior runs and the final knot are formed.

Final securing and removal
As the run reaches the superior end, the operator forms a knot sequence to secure the continuous line. Instrument ties (square throws) are placed, cinched and seated over the superior apex. In some sequences the final knot leaves two short tails; in others the tail is parked and the instruments are withdrawn after final tensioning. The last frames show the surgeon drawing final tension across the entire line, smoothing the approximated edges and then removing instruments from directly over the wound. In the closing frames both hands rest on either side of the wound, stabilizing the pad as the needle driver and forceps are removed; a parked free suture limb is visible exiting superiorly/rightward in many frames. The wound margins are well approximated with slight eversion along the midline and evenly spaced bites along its length. A modest central column of loops or locks is visible where the continuous line has advanced and been cinched, and the skin edges sit in good contact without gross gapping.

Summary
From placement of the initial stitch at the inferior end, through a combination of instrument ties and sequential bites, to a continuous progression toward the superior apex, the operator closes the central midline incision using a consistent needle technique (perpendicular entry, curvature‑driven passage, regrasping as required) and deliberate tissue handling (gentle eversion, dermal‑depth bites, even tension). Hands operate in opposition across the wound, trading roles and instruments smoothly as the closure advances. Occasional interrupted ties and parked needles are used to secure portions of the line, but the overall course is a methodical, continuous closure that results in an approximated, slightly everted midline wound with a secured terminal knot and the suture strand parked or trimmed above the apex. Minor inconsistencies (intermittent interrupted knot formation in some frames) are present in the frame set, but they do not disrupt the clear progression of the closure from inferior to superior nor the maintained attention to symmetric bite placement, eversion, and tension control that define the completed repair.
