COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure is carried out on a single short transverse skin incision near the upper third/top‑center of a simulation pad. From the first frames onward the operator consistently addresses that same horizontal wound, which measures roughly 2–4 cm in length. At the start of the recording a row of previously placed interrupted skin sutures spans the central portion of the incision; the operator’s work moves along the same line, progressively adding, adjusting, tying and trimming additional interrupted stitches to complete the closure. Throughout the case the team uses two primary instruments: a ringed needle driver (often with gold rings) and fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style pickup), with scissors/hemostats used intermittently for cutting and suture control.

Initial approach and needle passes
The operator begins by positioning both gloved hands immediately over and adjacent to the wound. The left hand most commonly holds the needle driver and the right hand holds the forceps, though there are brief alternations in specific frames. Early maneuvers show the needle driver grasping a curved, swaged suture needle roughly at the mid‑shaft or slightly closer to the swage (commonly described as two‑thirds from the tip in several frames). The needle is oriented so its curve will make a short, controlled arc through the skin edges — frequently passing from the superior (near) edge toward the inferior (far) edge, or from the operator’s side across the wound. The operator uses the forceps to elevate and present the near edge, tenting and everting the epidermal margin slightly to expose dermis for a precise bite.

Passes are executed with short, controlled rotations of the driver: the instrument aligns the needle curvature with the trajectory needed to take an epidermal/dermal bite on the far side of the incision, then advances the tip through the simulated skin and exits at a mirrored point. Throughout this phase, bites appear to be superficial (epidermis and superficial dermis) rather than deep or layered. The needle is repeatedly grasped at the mid‑to‑proximal shaft rather than at the very tip, providing leverage for controlled rotation while protecting the needle point from being obscured in the view. Instrument tips converge over the wound within a tight working zone (typically 1–4 cm tip‑to‑tip), and the hands frequently cross briefly over the incision as the needle is delivered and received.

Building the interrupted line
Although a baseline of multiple interrupted stitches exists at the central midline from the outset, the operator consistently places additional interrupted bites superior and lateral to that row, advancing the closure incrementally. The second and third sets of frames show new individual needle passes being made between and adjacent to existing sutures — the pattern is not a continuous running suture but a sequence of isolated interrupted stitches placed at close spacing. Each new pass is prepared by lifting the near edge with forceps to create slight eversion, inserting the needle with a controlled rotation through the opposing edge, and pulling the suture through so that sufficient tails are available for subsequent tying.

Hand dynamics remain constant while these placements occur: the left (driver) hand approaches from the viewer’s left or cephalad side, rotating the needle across the incision; the right hand presents and stabilizes tissue from the viewer’s right. In many frames the driver grips the needle roughly near the swage or shaft, aligning the jaw orientation with the needle curvature to maintain proper arc and needle control. The forceps tip receives the needle or steadies the limb of tissue, and the operator immediately draws the suture through to set up the next knot.

Edge handling and tissue preservation
Throughout the sequence the operator emphasizes atraumatic technique. Forceps are used with point contact to lift and evert epidermal edges without excessive traction; tissue handling is deliberate and minimal. The previously placed sutures already approximating the central wound assist in maintaining coaptation while new bites are added superiorly and laterally. The incision edges show slight eversion from the sutures — a desirable effect to counter subsequent contraction — but no gross puckering or strangulation is evident. Depth of bites remains superficial and consistent: epidermal and dermal purchase without engagement of deep tissue planes or wide undermining.

Progression toward final stitches and knot handling
As the procedure advances, activity shifts from needle passes to securing and finalizing stitches. Several segments of the recording show the needle not actively penetrating tissue; instead, the needle driver and forceps are used to manipulate suture loops, form throws, and tension knots. Knot‑tying maneuvers are performed directly over the incision with both hands remaining close together (typically within a few centimeters). The non‑dominant hand steadies the tissue and manages suture tails while the dominant instrument forms and tightens throws. At times the operator uses both index fingers to approximate the wound briefly while preparing a final throw, demonstrating careful suture coaptation prior to final tensioning.

Tail management and suture cutting are integrated into these finalization steps. Scissors or a ringed instrument appear intermittently in the right hand to trim excess suture after securement. The operator consistently maintains control of suture tails with forceps while snipping, ensuring knots are not disturbed during tail removal.

Spatial relationships and instrument choreography
Instrument approach vectors and relative hand positions remain remarkably stable: the needle driver most often approaches from the left/cephalad side of the pad, delivering the curved needle in a downward‑to‑upward or superior‑to‑inferior arc; the forceps reside on the right to present and receive the needle and manage suture tension. When tying and trimming, both hands move slightly closer, with the forceps frequently medial to the driver and the scissor/driver working laterally to cut tails. Crossing of instruments over the incision is brief and purposeful, mainly during needle passage or needle transfer. The working field remains compact — all actions occur directly over the same short transverse wound with instrument tips converging in a confined area.

Consistency and minor variations in technique
The overall technique is highly consistent: interrupted cutaneous bites, use of a curved swaged needle, mid‑shaft needle grips to facilitate controlled arcs, and point‑contact forceps to evert and present the epidermal margin. Small variations occur in grip position (mid‑shaft vs. two‑thirds from the tip) and which hand temporarily assumes the needle holder role in select frames, but these are minor and do not alter the staple pattern. At several points needle tip orientation and exact bite depth are partially obscured by instrument overlap or by suture loops; despite these occasional visual limitations, the observable elements consistently indicate superficial interrupted closure with adequate approximation and controlled tension.

Final passes and completion
The terminal frames focus on finishing the lateral/right‑most and superior‑most bites and securing the final knots. In these frames the operator completes one last needle pass in the lateral segment, draws the suture tails snug to approximate the edges, performs the required throws to form a secure knot, and trims the residual tails. Index fingers are briefly used to align the dermal edges and ensure even coaptation while the final knot is set. After tightening and cutting, the incision shows even approximation across its length with mild eversion at each interrupted site.

Final appearance and wound status
At the conclusion, the short transverse incision is uniformly closed with a closely spaced series of interrupted sutures. The skin edges are well coapted along the worked segment; prior central bites and the newly added superior/lateral bites combine to eliminate appreciable gapping. Tissue handling has been atraumatic — lift and eversion achieved with fine forceps, controlled needle arcs through superficial layers, and consistent knot security. Residual suture tails have been trimmed close to the knots, and no loose loops remain. The closure appears stable, with the surgeon having progressed from pass placement through suture management to secure knot tying and final trimming without introducing undue tension or distortion to the simulated tissue.

Summary of procedural flow
- Preparation: Both hands positioned over the same short transverse incision; left predominantly uses a ringed needle driver; right hand uses fine forceps and occasionally scissors/hemostat.
- Needle placement: Curved swaged needle grasped near mid‑shaft and rotated through the epidermis/dermis in short controlled arcs; the forceps tent and evert the near edge to present dermis.
- Stitch pattern: Sequential interrupted cutaneous bites added adjacent to an existing central row, building the closure superiorly and laterally in a methodical fashion.
- Knotting and trimming: After needle passes, the operator returns to knot formation, tensioning, and trimming suture tails with instruments held in close coordination.
- Completion: Final stitches secured and trimmed; incision exhibits even approximation with slight eversion, no apparent gaping, and minimal tissue trauma.

Throughout the recording the surgeon maintains a compact, synchronized working rhythm — alternating controlled needle passes with deliberate knot handling — to complete a reliable interrupted skin closure on the single transverse wound.
