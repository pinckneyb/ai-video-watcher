COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video documents a single, continuous skin closure on the same short transverse incision located at the superior center of the practice pad. From the very first frames through the end, the operator works exclusively on that topmost horizontal slit, sequentially placing, tightening, and finishing a row of simple interrupted stitches to approximate the simulated epidermal edges. The procedure proceeds in a deliberate, repetitive pattern of needle passage, tissue control, knot work and tail management; instrument handling, hand positions, and small technical adjustments evolve subtly as the repair is completed.

Opening sequence — preparing and initiating bites
At the outset the operator sets up over the superior incision with both hands immediately adjacent to the wound. One hand consistently handles grasping/manipulative instruments (Adson/thumb forceps or fine pickups) while the other controls a ringed instrument (needle driver/needle holder). The needle used throughout is a small, curved suture needle on a monofilament suture. Early passes show the driver grasping the needle roughly at the mid‑shaft or slightly more distal, with the curve oriented to carry the point from the near to the far edge in a controlled arc. The forceps tent and evert the opposing tissue edge to present a small, superficial bite. Bites are taken close to the epidermal margin, favoring eversion and edge-to-edge apposition rather than deep or widely spaced purchase. After the needle transits the tissue, the operator draws suture slack through and prepares the stitch for knotting.

Consistent bimanual coordination — opposing hand roles and approach angles
Throughout the procedure the hands operate in an opposing, bimanual fashion. Most commonly the needle driver approaches from one side of the incision while the forceps approach from the other, their tips meeting within a few centimeters above the wound. Relative orientation alternates slightly with each pass: in many segments the driver is on the viewer’s left and the forceps on the viewer’s right; in others the driver is on the operator’s right and the forceps on the left as small adjustments and regrasping occur. Instrument tips often cross the midline above the incision during needle passage or knot manipulation, but both hands remain close to the wound for fine control. The operator rests fingers on the pad for stabilization between maneuvers, maintaining a short working distance that supports precise needle arcs and controlled tissue approximation.

Needle handling patterns and small adaptations
Needle grasp location on the driver shifts subtly depending on task. During most needle passes the driver holds the needle around the mid‑shaft or toward the distal third, enabling a short, controlled rotation that drives the curve through the synthetic dermis with minimal sweeping motion. When retrieving or positioning the needle for a subsequent throw the operator occasionally repositions the grip nearer the swage or more proximally to gain leverage for rotation or to deliver a tighter, perpendicular entry. There are moments where the needle is held nearly parallel to the incision when manipulating suture tails or setting a knot, and other frames in which the needle is oriented perpendicular-to-oblique during active passage so that the tip exits on the opposing edge with a precise bite. Occasional regrasping of the needle in the driver is observed — a common technique to regain optimal control for the next arc.

Tissue handling and approximation philosophy
Across all segments the tissue strategy is consistent: small, superficial bites taken close to the wound edge, light eversion of the epidermal lips, and only modest traction on the suture line. The forceps are used intermittently to lift and evert one margin while the driver carries the needle through the opposite margin; this produces close epidermal apposition with slight eversion, which is maintained as knots are tied. The operator avoids wide bites or deep tissue traction; movement is confined to the superficial simulated dermis, consistent with an intent to obtain precise epidermal alignment and cosmetically favorable closure in a layered skin model.

Sequential placement and intermittent knotting/finishing
The suturing progresses in a sequential manner along the superior incision. In many frames the operator is shown actively passing a new needle bite; in others the focus shifts to knot tying, tensioning and trimming the most recently placed stitch before moving to the next adjacent site. This pattern — pass, draw, tie, trim, then move to the adjacent position — repeats across the repair. The operator routinely secures each stitch prior to advancing further along the incision, stabilizing the line and ensuring uniform closure spacing and tension. Over time the row of interrupted stitches becomes progressively more complete, and the operator transitions from frequent needle passes to a concentration on tying and tail management.

Knot technique and suture tail management
Knot work is executed with the same bimanual coordination as needle passage. One hand frequently holds a driver or hemostat to seat and control the knot while the other organizes the suture tails with forceps. Knots are secured with short, controlled throws and the operator carefully tensions each to maintain slight eversion without strangulating the simulated tissue. After knotting, suture tails are arranged and often trimmed with a scissor-like instrument introduced intermittently. There are clear sequences where the needle is no longer active in the field and instrument posture suggests cutting or trimming of suture tails, followed by brief palpation and adjustment of the repair.

Evolving hand positions and role reversals
Although the overall bimanual pattern remains constant, hand positions show modest evolution. Early frames depict the right hand holding the needle driver and the left hand holding the forceps; in many middle and later frames the roles sometimes reverse, with the left hand driving the needle and the right hand stabilizing tissue. These changes appear driven by comfort, slight repositioning of the operator’s hands around the top edge of the pad, or reorientation to better approach a particular stitch site. The distance between hands remains small — typically within a few centimeters — and the operator frequently rests digits on the pad edge for stability. When working at the most medial/cephalad portion of the incision the hands converge even closer, straddling the wound to finish the terminal stitches.

Spatial relationships and instrument crossings
Instruments often cross above the incision during needle passage and knotting, creating a compact working triangle. The needle driver, when active, provides the dominant motion for needle rotation, while the forceps provide counter-traction and edge presentation. The driver is alternately oriented parallel to the wound when manipulating needle tips or pulling suture through, and perpendicular when driving a bite. At several moments the needle driver is held more vertically, hovering over the wound as the operator seats or tightens a knot; in other moments it lies nearly flat and nearly parallel to the wound axis as the operator repositions the needle. The forceps consistently approach at a shallow angle to evert the margin, and at times the operator uses fingertip pressure to steady the pad while trimming suture tails.

Periods of tying and trimming rather than active needle passage
Interspersed with active passes are stretches where the operator focuses on managing and securing existing stitches. Some frame groups show no visible needle during several seconds of activity: instruments manipulate suture tails, trim ends, and inspect the row. These intervals reflect finishing work — seating knots, adjusting tension, trimming — and are an important component of the overall closure rhythm. On a few occasions the lack of a visible needle restricts precise assessment of the driver’s exact grasp orientation; despite that limitation, context (knotting posture, suture tail handling, and subsequent absence of a new needle pass) makes clear that these intervals are finish work on recently placed stitches rather than initiation of a separate repair.

Consistency of technique and small refinements
Overall the operator maintains a consistent simple interrupted technique throughout: controlled curved needle arcs, small epidermal bites, tissue eversion, secure knotting, and orderly tail management. Small technical refinements appear as the repair progresses: occasional regrasping of the needle nearer the tip when a tighter, perpendicular entry is required; slightly more proximal grasps when a longer arc or stronger purchase is needed; subtle adjustment in approach angle to compensate for the operator’s hand position as the row fills in. These refinements are modest and intended to preserve consistency of closure while adapting to the geometrical realities of finishing a short transverse incision.

Final passes, inspection and completion
In the closing stages the operator concentrates on the cephalad-most segment of the incision, tightening and finishing the final throws, trimming suture ends, and inspecting edge apposition. Final stitches are seated with slight eversion and even tension across the wound. The hands pause to palpate and visually confirm uniform approximation; instruments occasionally cross as the operator arranges suture tails and then cuts them flush. The procedure concludes with the operator lifting or adjusting the pad, suggesting completion and a brief inspection of the repair.

Final appearance and wound state
At the end of the sequence the superior incision is closed along its length with evenly spaced, secured interrupted stitches. Epidermal edges are apposed with slight eversion and no gross gapping; the row presents a consistent, tidy appearance across the short transverse defect. Suture tails have been managed and trimmed as the operator progressed, and the operator performed focused knot seating and adjustment to maintain even closure tension. Although the procedure was performed on a synthetic pad, the techniques applied—small, accurate bites, deliberate eversion, methodical knotting, and consistent hand positioning—reflect an approach aimed at fine epidermal alignment and reproducible outcomes.

Note on visual limitations
A small number of frames show the operator working with instruments but without the needle visibly present in the camera view; this limits fine assessment of exact needle grasp or the instantaneous orientation during those brief moments. However, the surrounding frames provide clear context for needle handling and establish the continuity of technique and intent.

In sum, the entire video captures a focused, sequential closure of the topmost transverse incision on the practice pad. The operator maintains a simple interrupted strategy with stable bimanual technique, incremental refinements in needle grasp and approach angle as needed, and consistent attention to edge eversion, knot security, and suture tail management. The result is a neatly approximated incision with uniformly seated interrupted sutures and a well‑controlled final inspection.
