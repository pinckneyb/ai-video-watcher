COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a focused closure of the central vertical incision on a synthetic skin pad — the middle of three parallel slits on the work surface. From the opening frames through the end of the sequence the operator repeatedly returns to and advances closure along this midline cut, adding, tensioning, securing, and finally dressing interrupted stitches to restore epidermal apposition. Although several frames show adjacent slits and occasional hand/instrument repositioning, the entire recorded effort centers on sequentially completing closure of that single midline line.

Initial approach and early passes (0.0–44.0s)
At the outset the operator works immediately over the central vertical wound, which already bears a row of previously placed interrupted sutures. Both hands are gloved and assume a classic two‑instrument, bimanual technique: a needle driver in one hand (commonly positioned to the operator’s left in early frames) and fine tissue forceps in the other providing edge control. The curved suture needle is consistently grasped in the driver roughly at mid‑shaft to one‑third from the tip, allowing controlled rotation through a shallow-to-mid dermal arc. The forceps present and gently evert or approximate the epidermal edge while the driver advances the needle across the gap to the opposing margin. Bites are deliberate and conservative — superficial to mid‑dermal on the silicone model — and the operator aligns epidermal edges with light traction so knots will sit flush without puckering. Instrument separation is minimal (typically within a few centimeters), hands flank the incision, and tips meet just above the tissue as each pass is executed.

Progression along the incision, methodical interrupted technique (45.0–164.0s)
Throughout the mid-portion of the recording the work progresses sequentially along the length of the midline incision. The operator continues placing interrupted stitches adjacent to the existing row, moving from the central region toward both superior and inferior extents in a stepwise fashion. The usual pattern is: needle held in the driver approach from one side, forceps lift/everting the near edge, needle traverses near-to-far edges in a controlled arc, the suture is drawn through, and the free end is managed by the opposing hand in preparation for knot‑tying.

Hand posture and exchange of roles are apparent but consistent: sometimes the left hand furnishes needle delivery while the right maintains tissue control, and at other intervals the roles reverse depending on the site being addressed. Grasp positions on the needle vary modestly — frequently mid‑shaft to near the tip — to balance control of rotation and to protect the model tissue. The operator keeps bites uniform in spacing and depth to maintain even wound apposition; slight edge eversion is purposefully created to counteract anticipated inversion during healing on real tissue. The suture material is routed predictably away from the bite as each loop is tightened and readied for a secure knot.

Reinforcement near the midline and suture handling (165.0–239.0s)
As the procedure continues the operator refines suture management between needle passes. Forceps are used intermittently to hold suture tails steady while the driver repositions the needle for the next bite. In several sequences the left-hand driver approaches from a lower-left or superior position, while the right-hand forceps stabilize the near edge. Instrument tips often cross in a controlled exchange above the incision when passing the needle from one side to the other. This phase also shows precise manipulation during knot formation: small, deliberate throws produce seated knots that maintain gentle tension on the wound edges without causing tissue puckering on the synthetic pad.

There are occasional frames where new sutures are placed slightly lateral or cranial to prior stitches, demonstrating the operator’s intent to maintain even spacing along the entire length. Throughout these passages the operator maintains close instrument spacing — typically 1–4 cm — for fine motor control, and the hands remain over the wound for consistent bimanual coordination.

Continuing bites, coordination and occasional free‑hand handling (240.0–329.0s)
The continued sequence documents the steady addition of further interrupted sutures, with the needle driver and forceps converging over the incision at each pass. Needles are often grasped near the swage or mid‑arc to allow the curvature to traverse tissue optimally; the driver is rotated to follow the arc rather than forcing a straight trajectory. The operator’s forceps present the tissue with slight lift and eversion so that skin margins approximate neatly when the suture is tightened.

At times the operator alternates how the instruments are presented: the driver may come from the operator’s left or right, or enter from a more cranial or caudal angle, dictated by local anatomy on the pad and by the need to maintain favorable hand ergonomics. The synchronous choreography of approach, bite, and suture retrieval repeats in an orderly fashion, extending the approximated line both superior and inferior where prior stitches left small gaps. The suture tails are periodically cut with scissors or managed by a hemostat to prevent entanglement as the closure proceeds.

Tying, adjusting and managing suture tails (330.0–419.0s)
After several passes the emphasis shifts partly from needle delivery to knot-tying and suture tail management. Frames in this interval show the operator alternating between instrument‑based knot‑tying and manual fingertip tensioning. One hand will hold the tail with forceps while the other manipulates the suture to form secure throws; at times a small instrument is introduced to assist with final tightening or trimming. The operator routinely checks edge apposition as knots are seated, applying light fingertip pressure to ensure the epidermal margins remain flush. Spatially the hands narrow their separation for fine control during knot-tying, with fingertips frequently occupying the immediate periwound area and instruments hovering within a short radius.

Technique refinement and consistency of bites (420.0–444.0s)
As the closure approaches completion the operator continues to apply the same interrupted technique, placing and securing additional stitches immediately adjacent to the established row. Needle orientation and grip stay remarkably consistent: mid‑shaft engagement in the driver, an arc-driven trajectory through skin, and modest rotation of the wrist to ensure a smooth passage. Tissue handling emphasizes gentle eversion and symmetrical bites to minimize tension and maintain cosmesis. The left hand often stabilizes centrally while the right delivers the needle, but frequent exchanges of role keep the approach adaptive to the precise location being closed.

Occasional variation and notes on technique deviation (390.0–404.0s and other frames)
While interrupted suturing is the dominant pattern, a short segment shows handling that resembles advancement of suture material in a more continuous fashion — a hand manipulating the needle between fingers and drawing a loop across the superior wound margin. This appears in a narrow interval where the operator manages the suture free‑hand rather than exclusively with a driver. Rather than a wholesale change in strategy, this behavior is best read as local adaptation: the operator momentarily changes handling to facilitate passage or to adjust tension, then returns to the interrupted, instrument‑driven technique. Such brief departures are noted as technique variation but do not alter the overall interrupted approach used for closure.

Late-stage refinement, cutting and final tensioning (450.0–464.0s)
The final active frames show the operator focused on securing and tidying the already-placed stitches: fingers compress the edges to assess tension, instruments are used intermittently to manipulate tails and cut excess suture, and manual approximation is used to confirm even apposition along the entire line. Hands are close to the incision as the last throws are tightened; suture tails are trimmed and oriented away from the wound. Instrument exchange patterns — occasional introduction of scissors or a small hemostat — are used to cut and route tails so they do not obstruct access to the remaining sites. Throughout this phase the operator maintains the deliberate spacing and shallow bite depth characteristic of the preceding passes.

Final inspection and end state (465.0–467.0s)
The sequence concludes with the central incision entirely approximated by a continuous row of interrupted stitches occupying the mid-portion of the wound. Tissue edges sit neatly opposed with slight, intentional eversion at the suture line; the alignment is even and stable. In the closing frames no hands are visible — a curved hemostat rests to the left of the board while the sutured wound remains centered on the platform — indicating that active manipulation has ceased. The final visual impression is a securely approximated wound with neatly tied interrupted knots and trimmed tails, minimal tissue distortion on the synthetic model, and instruments set aside.

Overall technique and spatial dynamics
Across the entire procedure the operator demonstrates a consistent, instrument‑based interrupted suturing technique: controlled needle placement with a driver, reciprocal tissue handling with fine forceps, and methodical knot formation. Needle grasps are predominantly mid‑shaft to near the tip depending on the arc needed; passage angles are mostly perpendicular-to-oblique to the wound edge, producing shallow-to-mid‑dermal bites appropriate for epidermal approximation on the model. Edge eversion is used uniformly to promote good apposition after tightening. Hands and instruments maintain a close, convergent relationship over the wound — typically within 1–4 cm — allowing precise coordination: one instrument advances the needle while the other presents the tissue, then both participate in suture retrieval and knotting.

There are small, well-documented deviations — brief periods of free‑hand needle handling, occasional fingertip tensioning rather than instrument-only handling, and one or two frames where attention to an adjacent slit is recorded — but none constitute a change from the principal interrupted method. Gaps in visual data (frames with no hands visible) are noted and limit the ability to observe intermediate motions in those instants, yet overall continuity of technique and stitch progression is clear.

Final outcome
By the end of the recording the central vertical wound is closed along its length by a contiguous series of evenly spaced, securely tied interrupted stitches. Epidermal margins are aligned, eversion is modest and consistent, and suture tails are managed and trimmed. The wound rests centrally on the pad without gaping or undue puckering; instruments are set aside and the work area appears stable, indicating completion of the staged closure.
