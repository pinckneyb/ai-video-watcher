COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a single, continuous closure effort focused on the vertical incision along the far right edge of the pad. From the outset, the operator establishes a disciplined cadence of needle loading, symmetric bite placement, instrument ties, and tail trimming, gradually marching from the lower third of this wound toward its upper end. The two adjacent incisions—one central and one just to the left of the right‑edge wound—serve as landmarks throughout but are not advanced as part of this closure. Occasional frames suggest momentary handling near other slits or suture management that looks “continuous,” yet the actual work shown for this case remains the same line of closely spaced, individually secured stitches on the far‑right incision. Where a frame set appears to depict activity on another incision, no independent suture run is taken there, and the narrative continuity remains with the right‑most wound.

The opening sequence establishes the technique and spatial habits. At the start, attention is on the right‑most vertical incision, working low on the wound near the pad’s inferior edge. The left hand controls a needle driver and the right hand uses fine forceps to evert the near wound edge. The curved needle is held about two‑thirds from the tip with the driver jaws; its curve is oriented perpendicular to the skin. The operator drives the arc from the patient’s right edge across to the left in a smooth wrist rotation. The synthetic skin edges are handled gently; the right lip is lifted just enough to present a perpendicular entry and to prevent shredding. The bite is placed a few millimeters off the margin with a mirror-depth exit on the far side. After the needle emerges, the driver regrips it to complete passage and prepare for the knot. By the end of this pass, one sees the right‑hand forceps maintaining tissue control while the driver crosses the incision line, keeping instrument motion concise and aligned with the wound axis.

Very early in the video there is a brief interlude over the central incision: the driver is seen loading a needle and forming loops, and a pass and initial tying motion occur at that midline cut. This remains a transient, self‑contained maneuver that does not develop into a closure; it reads as a preparatory or practice step. Thereafter, all subsequent progression, stitch placement, and knot security proceed on the right‑edge incision. No further advancement of the central slit occurs, and the closure proper is executed consistently along the far‑right line.

Returning to the right‑most incision, an initial knot and tail are visible near its lower third. The operator reloads the needle with the tip aimed leftward and stabilizes the near lip with pickups. The needle is grasped at the proximal third to mid‑curve, oriented perpendicular to the pad. The driver advances the tip across the gap while the pickups receive the emerging point on the far side. Spatially, the instruments straddle the incision with their tips within millimeters of the edge; the driver’s approach is slightly oblique from superior‑central, keeping the arc clean and perpendicular at entry. As the needle exits, the driver regrips to pull through. The suture trails neatly, and the free strand is managed to avoid snagging on adjacent stitches.

The next sequence focuses on settling that pass: the operator switches to tying. The driver (now in the left hand) manipulates the needle/strand to cast loops for an instrument tie while the right‑hand forceps help maintain wound edge approximation and strand control. The throws are seated directly over the skin, and scissors enter from the left to trim tails, with the right hand maintaining tissue alignment. The knot stack forms a compact cluster near the lower segment without crossing the incision line. Edges are gently everted by the prior bite as the knot is set.

With the baseline established, the operator proceeds to add more stitches just above the initial cluster. The technique remains consistent: the driver approaches from slightly superior/medial to the right‑edge incision, the forceps stabilize the near lip, and the needle is presented nearly perpendicular to the skin, entering from the right and exiting the left. The free strand is tensioned just enough to keep the path clear without flattening tissue. After passage, the driver regrips to draw the suture through, and once the approximation looks even with mild eversion, tying begins. Throws are completed and excess is trimmed. Each stitch is placed a few millimeters apart, building a regular, closely spaced line.

As the work climbs toward the mid‑lower portion, multiple frames show the same rhythm: the driver in one hand, the forceps in the other, with occasional hand swaps to preserve ergonomic angles. Sometimes the right hand holds the driver (particularly when approaching from the right side), and at other times the left hand takes over, especially during tying or when the angle of entry favors a left‑hand driver grip. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument, the bite mechanics remain constant: the needle is always held at the proximal third to mid‑curve, with a perpendicular approach and a controlled rotational arc. The forceps are used sparingly to evert and present just enough tissue for perpendicular entry and consistent depth; there is no crushing or aggressive pinching. The driver and forceps often cross briefly above the incision during the bite, then separate to pull the strand through in alignment with the wound.

Through the mid‑portion of the line, the operator alternates pass, tie, trim. In several sequences, scissors appear with a colored handle, and the needle driver carries a red band—visual anchors that recur near the right‑edge wound as each stitch is secured. Bites fall on either side of the incision with symmetric width and depth, typically 3–5 mm from the cut edge, and the exits mirror the entries. The edges approximate without gapping, showing mild, deliberate eversion. The suture is drawn through with gentle, controlled traction vectors: one hand stabilizes and tensions the strand while the other manages the driver or pickups. When reloading between passes, the driver is reset to keep the needle perpendicular to the skin at the next entry.

As the closure ascends into the mid‑upper region, there are intervals devoted entirely to tightening throws, seating knots, and cutting tails, without new tissue bites. These pauses serve to maintain a tidy, low‑profile knot stack and to keep the working field clear of errant loops. Often, the left hand stabilizes the suture line and tissue with forceps while the right hand (with scissors or driver) trims the tails. Scissors are kept parallel to the long axis of the wound to avoid inadvertently lifting edges. The hand positioning during these finishing steps shows the operator’s care in vector control—tension is applied just superior/medial to the stitch being finished, and the opposing hand supports the wound from the lateral side, minimizing torque on the fresh bite.

At points near the upper half of the incision, the operator places another stitch using the same perpendicular entry from right to left. The forceps evert the right edge for a clean perpendicular penetration, then move to stabilize the far edge for a controlled exit. The needle is regripped as necessary to maintain a smooth arc. When the suture is drawn through, the edges align, and the throw is formed and seated. Again, scissors come in to tidy the tails. The working distances remain short, with both instrument tips hovering within a few millimeters of the bite site to ensure consistent bite depth and alignment.

In several sequences the video shows actions such as tensioning along a “running strand,” or the wound described as bearing a “continuous line of closely spaced stitches.” The visual effect of many closely spaced interrupted knots can resemble a continuous line, and the operator’s habit of tensioning the working strand between bites can resemble running-suture management. However, the behavior captured—repeated instrument ties followed by tail trimming after discrete passes—remains consistent with the individually secured stitches seen throughout. Where frames describe “no new bite taken” while tension is adjusted, the operator is simply managing the already‑placed stitch before trimming, rather than advancing a continuous loop.

A few mid‑course frames depict work with a needle driver and scissors near the right‑side wound without visible passage—these sequences likely capture positioning and preparation for the next bite or final throws at the end of a stitch. The driver remains centered just superior to the wound, and the scissors operate lateral to it. The hands occasionally cross to manage the free end while keeping the driver aligned to the next entry point. This helps maintain perpendicular needle entry for the subsequent pass. The edges remain approximated by the recently placed stitches, which provide intrinsic stability and mild eversion even in the absence of direct forceps lift.

One short sequence toward the later third shows an apparent drift to the incision just left of the already‑sutured right‑edge line: the needle is reloaded and poised near the right margin of that adjacent slit. Importantly, there is no completed pass captured there as part of an independent closure, and the surrounding sequences resume over the far‑right wound with the usual pattern of bite, tie, and trim. Interpreting the continuity of the case, this brief probe reads as a positioning or orientation moment rather than the initiation of a new closure elsewhere. The ongoing closure remains the far‑right incision.

As the work approaches the superior end of the right‑edge wound, the operator adds another stitch at the topmost segment. The left hand often holds the driver over the superior end while the right hand uses forceps to control the free limb and the tissue edge; then scissors appear to trim tails. The curved needle is still grasped at the mid‑to‑distal third, perpendicular to the pad, and the pass is driven with controlled rotation. The pickups assist either in guiding the arc through or in receiving the needle on exit. Once the suture is drawn through and the edges are apposed, the throws are set and tails trimmed flush to the knot. The working posture during these top‑end maneuvers becomes more compact—hands bracket the superior end with instruments aligned parallel to the incision to protect the newly approximated margin.

There is a moment where the operator returns to the more inferior end after having worked superiorly, placing an additional bite to refine spacing closer to the wound’s caudal end. The same principles apply: the left hand stabilizes the far edge with Adsons for a clean exit, while the right hand drives from right to left. The strand is tensioned along the line to distribute forces evenly, and a securing maneuver is performed before trimming. This “back‑fill” of a distal stitch helps maintain uniform inter‑stitch spacing and edge eversion along the entire length.

Throughout, instrument choreography is tidy and predictable. The driver and pickups oppose one another across the wound, crossing only as needed to maintain perpendicular entry and a smooth arc. Forceps handle only the dermal edge and suture—no unnecessary grasping of the epidermis or deep tissue is seen. Bite width and depth remain symmetric from side to side, and the distance from the edge is kept consistent, resulting in a neat, linear series of stitches. The operator’s hands stay within a few millimeters of the bite site, preventing long lever arms that could torque the tissue. When cutting, the scissors are angled parallel to the incision and close to the knot to leave short tails, reducing suture burden on the surface.

In the last sequences, the operator is not driving new bites but finishing what has been placed: tightening throws, seating knots, and trimming the last tails along the right‑edge closure. The left hand briefly stabilizes the tissue/suture line with forceps while the right hand approaches with scissors; cuts are made without disrupting edge approximation. After trimming, both hands withdraw, and the wound remains closed and undisturbed.

Across the entire procedure, the suturing technique is consistently executed as individually placed, carefully tensioned stitches with instrument ties and tail trimming after each stitch. On a handful of frames, language in the scene description alludes to a “running” progression, yet the visual and instrument behavior captured—regripping for each pass, discrete tying episodes, and frequent trimming—support the ongoing pattern of discrete stitches. Where a single frame set appears to initiate a pass on the adjacent unsutured incision, there is no continuation or development of a closure there, and the case proceeds solely on the far‑right line.

By the end, the far‑right vertical incision is fully approximated along the segment that was targeted during the session, with a closely spaced row of evenly placed stitches from the lower third up to the superior end. The edges are aligned with mild eversion, the bite spacing is uniform, and the knot stacks are compact with short, neatly trimmed tails. The instrument handling remains parallel to the wound axis throughout, and the final state shows a stable, well‑approximated closure on the right‑edge incision. The central and left incisions remain unadvanced relative to this closure effort, aside from the early, isolated practice motion observed briefly at the midline. Overall, the work demonstrates deliberate needle handling, precise tissue control, and consistent spatial discipline from the first bite at the inferior end through the last knot trimmed near the top, culminating in a clean, cosmetically thoughtful approximation of the right‑side wound.
