COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on the right‑most vertical incision of the three parallel slits on the synthetic skin pad. From the first frames through the end of the recording, the operator concentrates on that single linear defect, sequentially adding and securing interrupted stitches along its length while using standard two‑handed needle‑and‑forceps technique on a superficial full‑thickness practice model.

Initial exposure and first passes (0.0–44.0 s)
At the outset the wound is a clean vertical slit with no sutures at its site. Both hands move into position immediately adjacent to the incision: a needle driver in one hand and toothed Adson‑style forceps in the other. The forceps tent and evert the nearer margin to present the dermis while the needle driver, holding a curved needle roughly at or just distal to mid‑shaft, advances the needle in a controlled arc from the lateral surface toward the wound center. Bites are deliberately small and superficial, taking dermal/subdermal tissue only. The non‑driving hand rests on the pad and provides counter‑traction and approximation as the needle exits. Early frames show the formation of a first stitch as the suture material is pulled through and a loop temporarily spans the wound before tightening.

Establishing the pattern and coordinated instrument use (15.0–104.0 s)
With the initial bite placed, the operator establishes a consistent rhythm. The pair of instruments remain close to the wound (usually within a few centimeters), exchanging roles of holding and stabilizing as needed. The needle is most often grasped mid‑shaft or slightly posterior to midpoint, occasionally nearer the swage for fine control; it is oriented so the curvature naturally drives the tip from the near edge toward the opposing margin. The assisting hand alternates between toothed forceps and fingertip stabilization, lifting the near edge to allow accurate needle entry and mild eversion of the tissue to promote edge approximation when tightened. Several additional interrupted passes are placed adjacent to the first stitch, progressing along the length of the slit. Each pass is followed by pulling the suture through and preparing a throw rather than immediately performing long tangential arcs; the emphasis is on small controlled bites and precise apposition.

Sequential placement and consolidation (60.0–180.0 s)
As the procedure continues, the operator methodically advances along the incision. Needle grips remain consistent — mid‑shaft to just posterior to midpoint — and needle orientation stays largely lateral‑to‑medial across bites. The assistant hand provides steady counter‑traction with forceps or gloved fingertips, bringing the edges together and maintaining alignment during needle passage. There is a clear pattern of sequential interrupted stitches being placed in close, evenly spaced intervals; the synthetic dermis accepts shallow, full‑thickness bites that avoid deep layer capture or undermining. After each pass the suture loop lies externally and is brought under tension for tying. At times frames show the operator focusing on completing knot throws and manipulating suture tails rather than placing a new pass, indicating the typical cycle of pass–tie–cut that punctuates interrupted closure.

Tying, adjusting, and fine manipulations (105.0–240.0 s)
Midway through the recording the team alternates between placing new passes and securing existing loops. The needle driver is repeatedly used not only for needle delivery but also for knot manipulation — holding and reorienting suture material while fine forceps or fingers form instrument throws. The non‑dominant hand often moves from stabilization into active suture handling: lifting the suture tails to create tension, trimming tails with scissors in some frames, and pressing the tissue to maintain approximation during final throws. Throughout these steps the operator preserves the same small‑bite, superficial technique; wound edges are approximated with slight eversion at the surface as knots are tightened, and the suture knots remain visible lateral to the incision line.

Progression toward completion along the linear defect (240.0–330.0 s)
The work moves steadily toward the superior portion of the slit. Previously placed stitches form a neat row that crowds the medial margin; new stitches are added adjacent and slightly proximal to the prior ones. In the driver hand the curved needle is repeatedly grasped near the body, and the driver tip is brought from a superior‑lateral approach to deliver each bite. The assistant hand alternates between forceps and fingertips for delicate suture handling — pulling the suture to approximate the wound, holding tails taut for knot formation, and occasionally repositioning existing knots for better alignment. The operator maintains close spacing between hands and instruments (commonly within 1–4 cm) to allow precise needle trajectory and immediate edge control.

Late passes, refinement, and intermittent tying (285.0–359.0 s)
Near the latter third of the recording the sequence shows both completion of additional interrupted passes and recurrent knot work. At moments the operator does not reinsert the needle but concentrates on instrument ties and trimming of suture tails. The technique remains the same: small, even bites; mild eversion; and surface‑level bites that avoid deep tissue. The hands continue to move in a coordinated fashion — the driver above/over the wound, the forceps lateral or medial to the site — with the left or right hand occasionally switching roles depending on the orientation and proximity of the next bite. The suture line grows progressively, a continuous row of individually tied interrupted knots that draw the wound margins into close apposition.

Final consolidation, tail management, and inspection (360.0–398.0 s)
In the final phase the operator focuses on securing the completed row and tidying suture tails. Repeated frames show the operator completing the last instrument ties, adjusting knot tension to maintain edge alignment, and using fine forceps or scissors to shorten tails. There are brief moments with minimal instrument motion where the hands step back to assess approximation. One frame sequence includes a transient occlusion of the field by a gloved hand, limiting visual detail for a brief interval, but the subsequent frames confirm no additional passes were being added beyond tightening and trimming. The row of interrupted knots lies neatly along and just lateral to the incision, projecting slightly above the tissue surface with short suture tails that have been managed and trimmed.

Technique consistency and evolution
Throughout the entire procedure the operator adheres to a consistent simple interrupted technique. Needle handling remains deliberate and controlled, with mid‑shaft to slightly posterior grips, short, rotating arcs to pass the curved needle through dermal tissue, and immediate assistance from forceps or fingers to present and evert the near edge. There is no shift toward layered closure, running sutures, mattress stitches, or deep tissue capture; the approach is uniformly superficial, respectful of tissue planes on the pad, and focused on precise edge approximation. The only evolution is procedural: early frames focus on establishing initial bites, mid frames on sequential placement and knot tying, and late frames on securing knots, trimming tails, and final inspection.

Hands and instruments in space
The spatial choreography is constant and intimate. The instrument hand — usually the dominant hand with the needle driver — operates above and slightly lateral to the incision, delivering the needle with short, controlled movements. The non‑dominant hand alternates between forceps and fingertip control and is frequently positioned immediately adjacent to the wound to lift, evert, and approximate the margin. Inter‑hand distance stays small throughout, facilitating precise needle placement and immediate edge alignment. When knot tying and tail trimming are performed, the hands cross briefly over the wound and then return to lateral/medial positions for final stabilization.

Final appearance and wound state
At the conclusion the incision is closed with a neat, evenly spaced row of interrupted sutures. The margins are in close apposition with mild surface eversion where knots have been tightened. Suture knots project lateral to the incision and suture tails have been shortened and managed. There is no evidence of wide gaping, deep layer puckering, or undermining — the closure is consistent with superficial skin approximation on a simulation pad. The operator’s final actions concentrate on ensuring uniform tension along the line and tidying the field, after which the suture row remains intact and the wound appears well approximated and ready for sterile dressing or completion of the simulated task.

Throughout the recording the operator demonstrates a steady, methodical interrupted suturing technique: careful needle grips, coordinated two‑handed tissue handling, sequential placement of adjacent bites along the length of the defect, careful knot formation and tail management, and a consistent focus on precise epidermal/dermal approximation without deep tissue engagement.
