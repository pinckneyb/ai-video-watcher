COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure centers on a single vertical incision located just to the right of the pad’s midline. From the first frames through the close of the video, all instrument activity, needle passes, suture management, and knotting are focused on that same right‑of‑center slit, with the team progressively placing and securing a series of skin bites that approximate and evert the margins along its superior–inferior axis.

Beginning (0–30 seconds)
At the outset, the operator prepares and takes the initial bite in the mid‑portion of the right‑of‑center slit. A curved needle, grasped by the needle driver roughly two‑thirds from the tip, is presented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. The driver advances from the pad’s left side and, with controlled wrist rotation, drives the needle through the far (right) edge of the incision. Toothed forceps in the opposite hand lift and evert the right wound lip to present a dermal margin and provide counter‑traction, ensuring a symmetric, superficial bite through the dermis. The needle follows its curvature, exits the lumen, and the suture strand is drawn through and kept superiorly and clear of adjacent incisions.

Note: a small segment of frames early in the clip (15–29 s) describes handling around a central slit; however, the bulk of the observations and all subsequent activity concentrate on the right‑of‑center incision. For continuity, the narrative follows the single right‑of‑center incision as the operative focus.

Establishing bites and apposition (30–120 seconds)
After the first bite, the team continues placing additional individual passes along the same slit. The needle is repeatedly grasped in the driver at varying points along its curvature — commonly at the proximal third or about two‑thirds from the tip — to maintain a consistent arc and good purchase through the dermis. Instrument orientation remains nearly perpendicular to the skin throughout each pass. Hands operate in a predictable, opposing arrangement: one hand (often the driver hand) approaches from the patient’s left and crosses the wound toward the right, while the other hand uses Adson/forceps to evert and stabilize the right wound edge.

As each pass is completed, the driver frequently regrips the needle closer to the tip to pull the suture through and then re‑positions for the next bite; this regrasping preserves needle control and avoids inadvertent tearing. Forceps handle the tissue atraumatically — everting and lightly lifting the dermal edge rather than crushing it — so that bites are placed a few millimeters from the cutaneous margin and at symmetric depths on both sides. Early stitches appear to be placed as separate simple interrupted passes: needle through one side, then through the opposite side, strand drawn through, and the field prepared for knot formation.

Progression toward a continuous line and early tying maneuvers (60–150 seconds)
As the sequence evolves, the same pattern of placement is repeated along the superior direction of the slit. Several frames show the operator shifting between placing a fresh bite and securing a previously placed one. The team intermittently performs instrument ties over existing stitches: the needle driver is used to form throws by wrapping the long strand while the free short end is held by forceps; sequential throws are then cinched down to seat a knot. During these tie maneuvers, the needle is sometimes temporarily left to the side or entirely out of the driver while attention focuses on securing the loop.

Hand roles alternate somewhat over time. In many early passes the left hand holds the needle driver and the right hand manages the forceps that evert the tissue; in other sequences the right hand controls the needle holder and the left hand handles suture management or assists with a second instrument. Regardless of which hand holds the driver, the hands remain closely opposed across the incision and oriented so the driver tip moves millimeters from the wound edge on each pass.

Mid‑procedure: building a continuous, tensioned line (150–240 seconds)
By the midpoint of the video the wound’s superior half already shows multiple stitches in place and the operators begin to link stitches so the closure behaves as a continuous line rather than isolated interrupted throws. Needle handling continues to emphasize perpendicular presentation and following the curvature through an arc from one lip to the opposite. Grasp points on the needle vary — from mid‑body to one‑third from the swage — depending on whether the needle is being driven, repositioned, or retrieved at the exit.

Forceps and a second instrument are used interchangeably to grasp tissue, manage the short tail, or assist passage. At times a second hemostat or assisting driver is used to control the suture loop while the primary driver regrips the needle to complete a pass. The operators deliberately keep the long strand and working end superior to the working field to avoid tangles with adjacent slits on the pad. Tissue handling remains gentle throughout; bites aim for symmetric, dermal capture to achieve good eversion without undue tension.

During this phase the line develops a recognizable rhythm: repeated passes are followed by incremental tensioning of the suture and the formation of small loops or locking throws at intervals. The needle is periodically left on the strand while the drivers are used for instrument tying, indicating a hybrid technique where both interrupted and running/locking elements are used to secure the line.

Upper segment and locking/continuous technique (240–300 seconds)
Work shifts progressively toward the superior end of the slit. Several frames document intentional regrasping of the needle about one‑third from the swage to achieve an optimal angle for the next cross‑bite. Loops are deliberately formed and tightened sequentially along the closure, adding new bites immediately superior to the already approximated portion. The operators form locking loops on the running segment: one hand maintains suture tension while the other manipulates the driver to create a loop and then cinches it to lock the line. This behavior — small surface locks and continuous advancement — produces a series of closely spaced stitches with slight eversion and maintained approximation of the wound edges.

During these superior passes, hand positions are consistent with previous activity but optimize for knot formation: one hand holds the driver across the incision to fashion and tighten the loop while the other manipulates the free end or applies counter‑tension. Instrument crossing over the incision is limited and deliberate; drivers span the slit transversely during tying, and forceps stay just lateral to the wound edge to avoid interference.

Final tying, tensioning, and trimming (300 seconds to end)
In the final frames, attention focuses on securing the top of the line and finishing. The needle is sometimes not engaged in tissue for the last steps and is left tucked near the superior field while the team performs instrument tying and final throws. Multiple sequential throws are formed with the needle driver; the assistant or opposite hand holds and positions the tail with forceps. The knot is advanced down to the tissue, each throw is tightened to seat the loop, and tension is carefully balanced to approximate but not strangulate the dermis. Gentle digital pressure is applied intermittently to verify apposition.

Scissors are introduced briefly to trim the superior tails after knotting. A hand palpates the stitched area to confirm edge alignment and assess for minor gapping. Across the final segment the superior half of the slit displays closely spaced stitches with small locking elements and consistent eversion. No activity is observed on other slits; suture management and cutting are confined to the right‑of‑center incision.

Technique development and consistency
Across the entire case the operators demonstrate a consistent, methodical technique that evolves from placing discrete, symmetric dermal bites to forming a more continuous, locked running line toward the superior end. Needle presentation is reliably perpendicular to the skin, and the arc of passage follows the curvature of the needle. Regrasping to adjust angle and position is frequent and deliberate, showing attention to needle control and bite symmetry. Tissue handling remains atraumatic throughout: forceps are used to evert margins rather than to compress tissue, and counter‑traction is applied judiciously to prevent tearing.

Hand positions and spatial relationships
Hands remain opposed across the incision throughout the procedure, forming a narrow working triangle over the slit. The driver commonly approaches from the left and the forceps from the right, but the roles alternate as needed: sometimes the right hand holds the driver and the left the forceps or a second driver. Instruments typically cross over the incision only when tying; otherwise they operate parallel to and immediately adjacent to the wound margins. The suture strand is kept superior to the field for the majority of the case, and when loops are created they are handled above the incision to avoid snagging.

Final state of the repair
By the end of the video the superior half of the right‑of‑center slit is fully approximated with closely spaced, small bites and evidence of locking/continuous elements in the suture line. Edges demonstrate gentle eversion, and knots at the superior terminus have been formed and trimmed. The inferior portion of the slit remains either partially approximated by earlier passes or prepared for additional sutures beyond the clip’s end, but the segment worked during this recording shows secure approximation with maintained tissue integrity and no signs of excessive crush or tension. The needle is either tucked aside or off the driver after the final knots, scissors are used to trim the tails, and the field is inspected with light digital pressure to confirm an even, sealed closure.

Overall, the procedure is a focused, deliberate closure of the vertical right‑of‑center incision: repeated controlled needle arcs produce symmetric dermal bites; forceps-controlled eversion preserves margin apposition; driver regrasping and careful loop formation permit both interrupted and running/locking elements to be integrated into a secure, cosmetically favorable closure.
