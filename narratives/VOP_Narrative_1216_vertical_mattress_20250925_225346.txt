COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single linear skin repair on the left side of the practice pad — a vertical incision that is worked sequentially along its length. From the first frames through the last, the operator returns repeatedly to that same line, placing a series of simple interrupted stitches and finishing with knotting and tensioning maneuvers to approximate the synthetic dermal edges.

At the outset the incision is a short vertical defect in the upper‑left quadrant of the pad. The operator positions the instruments in a compact working triangle: a needle driver is held vertically over the wound while fine toothed forceps sit lateral to the incision to manipulate tissue and the suture tail. The curved suture needle is grasped in the driver near the body of the shaft rather than at the very tip, oriented to pass from the near side to the far side with a controlled arc. The near edge is elevated and slightly everted with the forceps so the needle bites through a shallow dermal plane just millimeters from the margin. The first pass demonstrates careful, small bites focused on epidermal/dermal apposition rather than deep purchase; the needle is delivered perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin surface, then rotated and withdrawn through the opposing edge as the forceps maintain alignment. After needle passage the suture strand is advanced and managed with the free hand, preparing for knot tying.

As the sequence continues, the operator repeats that pattern along the same vertical line. Hands remain tightly coupled around the incision with instrument tips generally within a few centimeters of each other. One hand holds the needle driver and manipulates the curved needle — often grasped mid‑shaft or two‑thirds from the swaged end depending on the particular pass — while the other holds fine toothed Adson‑type forceps (or a skin hook/pickup) to pick up tissue, approximate edges, and control suture tails. The needle is frequently re‑grasped, rotated through a controlled short arc, and withdrawn with small, precise motions. Throughout these early and mid frames the operator consistently targets a superficial dermal bite with slight eversion of the near edge, preventing inversion and promoting epidermal edge alignment.

During multiple successive passes the technique is unmistakably sequential and interrupted in nature: a needle bite is made at one point, the thread is pulled through, tensioned and prepared for knotting before the next distinct bite is taken adjacent to the prior stitch. The operator systematically advances cranially along the incision; earlier frames show work at the inferior-to-mid portions and later frames show the row of interrupted stitches extending upward, with the active work progressing toward the superior margin. Instrument orientation is fairly consistent — the needle driver typically operates from above or superior‑medial positions, the forceps approach from lateral or inferior positions — and they alternate crossing briefly when exchanging the needle or when one instrument needs to receive a pass from the other.

Needle handling is deliberate and uniform. The curved needle is most often grasped near mid‑shaft or slightly distal to mid‑shaft so that the operator controls curvature and penetration angle. The driver is used to rotate the needle through the dermis in a short, controlled arc rather than with a long sweeping motion. On delivery, the needle tip enters at an oblique/perpendicular angle, traverses a superficial-to-mid dermal plane, and exits close to the opposing margin. The tissue is not over‑penetrated; depth remains limited to the synthetic dermis and epidermis, consistent with superficial skin closure on a practice pad. When necessary, the operator repositions the needle with fine forceps to ensure appropriate bite depth and angle before advancing.

Tissue handling emphasizes gentle eversion and precise apposition. The non‑dominant instrument lifts the near lip to present dermis, while the driver advances the needle through the far edge. The operator avoids crushing tissue with the forceps, aiming for atraumatic control. Occasional small puckers are noted around some previous bites, and in a few frames the operator applies slight counter‑traction or flattens a puckered area before tightening the stitch; overall however the stitches bring the margins into close apposition with minimal inversion. This pattern is maintained across the entirety of the line: bites taken near the edge, slight eversion, and gentle approximation when pulling suture tails taut.

Throughout the case, hand positions evolve in small, task‑driven ways but remain spatially compact. Early frames show the needle driver held vertical over the bite site with forceps lateral. As sutures accumulate inferiorly, the driver and forceps gravitate toward the superior, unfinished portion — the operator anchors an instrument at a secured stitch and uses the other hand to manipulate the free suture tail and perform knot throws. At times the left hand serves as the needle‑holding platform while the right hand performs knotting maneuvers; in other moments the right hand holds the forceps to steady tissue while the left advances the needle. Hands cross and exchange instruments periodically: the operator transfers the needle between forceps and driver when needed, or momentarily rests a hemostat above the wound to manage tails. Still, the instruments remain within a narrow working distance to allow immediate transfer and precise control.

As the repair proceeds, the operator alternates phases of placement and completion. Some frames capture fresh needle passes in which the driver approaches from a superior‑lateral angle and delivers the needle through the far edge while the forceps steadies the near side. Other frames depict the completion phase: the needle has been withdrawn, the suture is being tensioned, knot throws are being formed and secured, and excess suture is trimmed. Knotting is performed in a coordinated two‑handed fashion with the driver or a hemostat anchoring close to the secured stitch while the opposite hand loops and tightens throws. These finish‑step frames also show the operator anchoring an instrument at the superior‑most completed stitch while working slightly medial and inferior to perform the knot — a stable platform facilitates consistent tensioning.

There is an occasional observation that differs from the dominant interrupted pattern. In one segment a horizontal running strand is described crossing multiple marks and the operator trims excess suture after completing a pass. That configuration is an outlier among the many frames showing discrete interrupted bites, and it could reflect a brief instrument exchange at an adjacent simulation site or a single frame mischaracterization. Across the majority of frames the technique is sequential interrupted closure, and the operator returns to the single vertical line to continue interrupted placement and secure knots. Where that discrepancy exists, it does not become the prevailing method; the subsequent frames continue the interrupted, bite‑tie‑advance workflow.

Spatial relationships remain tightly regulated throughout. The needle driver generally approaches from superior/medial quadrants and the forceps come from lateral/inferior positions. The tips of the instruments are habitually 1–3 cm apart as they flank the incision, permitting opposing but coordinated motions: one instrument presents and steadies tissue while the other drives and withdraws the needle. When knot tying or tensioning, the hands close further — sometimes only a centimeter or two apart — to control suture throws and prevent suture slack or uneven tension. During needle exchanges the instruments briefly cross over one another; the operator uses the non‑dominant forceps to receive or orient the needle before re‑securing it in the driver.

Tactile control and economy of motion are hallmarks of the technique. Moves are small, deliberate, and repeatable: needle positioning, arc delivery, brief withdrawal, suture passage, tensioning and knotting. Instrument exchanges occur with fluidity — the operator will occasionally rest a hemostat on the pad to hold a tail, or switch a needle from pickup to driver to facilitate a controlled pass. Scissors or a small cutter are used episodically to trim excess tail after knot completion. Throughout, suture purchase remains superficial: bites take dermal tissue to appose the epidermal margins, and there is no engagement of deeper layers, consistent with skin‑only closure on a practice model.

As work progresses toward the superior end of the incision a full row of evenly spaced interrupted stitches emerges. Earlier gaps at the superior portion are methodically filled: the operator moves cranially along the incision, recreating the same approach at each step — lift/evert with forceps, drive a short controlled bite with the needle driver, withdraw and pull suture through, tension and tie. In later frames the operator anchors the needle driver at the superiormost stitch and the opposite hand performs knotting actions and final adjustments, indicating closure of the final bites. The entire repair exhibits uniform stitch spacing and similar superficial bite depth, which produces consistent alignment of the epidermal edges.

Technique consistency is strong. From the first passes to the last, the operator adheres to simple interrupted suturing with superficial dermal bites and slight eversion for edge alignment. Needle grasp position remains mostly mid‑shaft to distal mid‑shaft, providing reliable curvature control. The operator favors a short arc needle pass rather than full sweeping arcs; this minimizes gratuitous tissue disruption and keeps bites shallow. Knot‑tying technique is repeated in a similar two‑handed pattern for each secured stitch, producing compact, low‑profile throws. Any variation — such as brief flattening of puckering or minor adjustments in bite spacing — appears to be corrective and aimed at improving edge coaptation rather than a change in technique.

By the end of the recording the incision is closed with a continuous row of interrupted stitches along its length. The wound margins lie in close apposition with slight eversion visible at most bite sites, and previously observed minor puckers have been minimized by controlled tensioning. The final frames show the operator working at the superior end: a needle is controlled in the driver, the suture is being tightened and secured, and the last knot is being finalized while adjacent stitches hold the line closed. Instruments remain close to the skin, and the operator executes final trims and small adjustments to tails. No deep layers were incorporated at any point — closure is limited to skin layers on the synthetic pad.

In summary, the repair is a methodical, stepwise closure of the left‑sided vertical incision using repeated simple interrupted sutures. The operator maintains tight instrument coordination, consistent needle handling, and attention to edge eversion and gentle tissue handling. Any transient anomaly (a frame suggesting a running strand) does not alter the overall strategy: interrupted bites are placed sequentially from one end of the incision toward the other, each is tensioned and knotted with two‑handed control, and the end result is a uniformly approximated linear closure with neatly secured superficial stitches.
