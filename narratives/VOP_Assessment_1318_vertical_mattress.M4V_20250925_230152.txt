COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video follows a single linear skin incision on a synthetic practice pad from the first needle passage through the tissue to the finishing adjustments and tail trimming. From start to finish the operator works along that same wound, adding a sequence of individual stitches, securing knots, and trimming suture tails while maintaining consistent instrument choreography and tissue handling. The story below traces that progression in chronological order, describing instrument use, needle handling, tissue interaction, how the hands move relative to the wound, the development of the closure technique, and the final appearance of the repair.

Opening sequence — initial bite and set-up (0–14 s)
At the outset the incision is a short horizontal linear cut, midline on the pad. Both hands are immediately adjacent to the wound: the left hand controls a needle driver and the right hand holds toothed Adson-style tissue forceps. A curved suture needle is introduced and grasped in the driver, held a short distance from the tip so the driver can rotate the curve smoothly. The operator orients the needle nearly perpendicular to the wound margin and advances it in a controlled arc from the near edge to the far edge, while the forceps elevates and slightly everts the skin margin. The synthetic dermis is placed under mild traction to permit a precise shallow-to-moderate bite a few millimeters from the epidermal margin. The initial transcutaneous pass is completed, and the suture material appears beneath the wound, ready to be drawn and secured.

Early progression — handling and adjustments to placed stitch(es) (15–44 s)
Shortly after the initial pass the operator works immediately adjacent to the incision to adjust suture loops and tails. In one short interval the left-hand instrument presents as a needle driver while the right hand manipulates the free tail with forceps; the team tightens loops and prepares for knotting. Notably, a brief segment of frames visually resembles a running subcuticular line, with a serpentine suture track described along the incision; this visual is discrepant with the prevailing sequence of standard transcutaneous passes and interrupted knots seen elsewhere. Despite that single appearance, the operator otherwise continues with instrument exchanges and manipulations typical for separate interrupted stitches: the driver presents and withdraws the needle in short arcs while the forceps control and tension the suture tails. Small snips and trimming of tails occur during this phase as the operator refines previously tied loops.

Establishing a repeated workflow — placing additional interrupted stitches (45–104 s)
Over the next intervals the operator establishes a clear, repetitive workflow for closure. The incision—often described as diagonal, vertical, or horizontal depending on slight camera framing shifts—has multiple previously placed interrupted stitches. The left hand remains the primary needle-driving hand, frequently holding a gold‑ringed needle driver. The right hand consistently serves as tissue stabilizer and suture manager with Adson-style toothed forceps. The needle is repeatedly grasped across the mid‑shaft or slightly nearer the swage, oriented to favor small controlled arcs. Passes are short and deliberate: the driver presents the needle tip into the tissue while the forceps lifts and aligns the opposite edge for capture. Bites are taken through the dermal layer and, on the simulator, through full-thickness synthetic skin in some frames. After withdrawal of the needle the suture limbs are tensioned, tied with multiple throws, and subsequently trimmed with curved Mayo or scissors introduced intermittently by the left hand.

Mid-procedure variation — knot tying, trimming, and stabilization (60–134 s)
In the middle portion of the recording the pattern of activity alternates between placing new bites and completing already-placed stitches. Hands remain close to the incision throughout; the left-hand needle driver presents, rotates, and retrieves the needle while the right-hand forceps approximates and stabilizes the skin edges and manages the suture tail. At times the left instrument is switched from a driver to scissors for tail cutting; a long mosquito hemostat and other instruments rest on the field, and an occasional gold-handled driver features prominently. Needle grips vary from mid‑shaft to a mid‑to‑distal position as the operator adjusts for control and for the curvature of each pass. Tissue handling is consistently atraumatic—edges are lifted, not crushed, and tensioning is controlled to avoid excessive eversion. The operator completes a stitch by drawing the suture, placing secure throws, and trimming the tails; then the process repeats at the next adjacent point along the same incision.

Continued placement toward the wound ends — coordinated opposition and short passes (135–194 s)
As the procedure advances, the operator continues to add stitches along the incision, generally working from central areas to adjacent points toward either the inferior or distal ends of the wound depending on the frame. Hands are symmetrically opposed across the incision: the needle driver approaches from one side (commonly the viewer left or lateral side), while the forceps approach from the opposite side to guide and grasp tissue. Needle passes are controlled and localized—short arcs rather than broad sweeping movements—so that the bite depth remains superficial to mid‑dermal on the simulator, producing mild eversion after knot tightening. The left hand periodically alternates from controlling the needle to using scissors to cut tails; the right hand steadies tissue and grasps suture tails when transferring instruments or tying. At times the driver holds the needle closer to the hub for greater leverage when passing thicker sections, and elsewhere the grip moves slightly toward the mid‑shaft to swivel the curve through the dermal plane.

Later-phase passes and finishing steps — final knot stacks and tail management (195–239 s)
In the final full sequences the operator consistently completes each stitch by passing the needle through the opposing edge, drawing the suture tight to approximate the margins, tying multiple throws to secure the knot, and trimming the tails. During these frames the hands remain within a small working zone—only a few centimeters apart—so that needle transfer, suture retrieval, and knot-tying are efficient and coordinated. The right hand often brings a small suture cutter or curved scissors into play to trim the recently secured knot, while the left hand stabilizes with the needle driver or a hemostat. Instrument crossing is minimal but occurs occasionally during exchanges; the driver generally stays lateral and proximal to the incision while the forceps are medial and nearer the wound tip. Bites are placed at evenly spaced intervals and with similar depth, producing closely approximated epidermal edges with minimal gap or tenting.

Completion and low-visibility finishing — adjustment and final inspection (240–266 s)
Toward the end of the video the incision shows several already-secured interrupted sutures and short tails; much of the remaining work focuses on adjusting tension, cutting tails, and ensuring even approximation. In one final interval the operator’s hands are primarily off-camera or in the top-right quadrant and no active needle pass is visible—the field shows the sutures in place, edges closely apposed with minimal eversion, and only a small central gap remains at one point. The operator uses scissors or the driver-tip to trim tails and make last adjustments, moving instruments from the right-to-upper field back toward the wound center. At times a long mosquito clamp rests on the pad, indicating instrument organization while the operator completes the finishing steps.

Hands, instrument choreography, and spatial relationships throughout
Throughout the entirety of the recording the choreography is highly consistent. The left hand is the principal needle-controlling hand, using a ring-handled needle driver (often gold-handled) to present, rotate, and withdraw the curved suture needle. The right hand is the primary tissue-handling and suture-managing hand, using Adson-style toothed forceps to lift, evert slightly, and align skin edges as well as to retrieve suture tails for knotting. Hands flank the incision and operate within a small confined zone, often a few centimeters apart, allowing direct coordination: the needle driver advances the needle tip while the forceps presents the opposing edge and secures the suture limb. Occasionally the left hand switches to scissors to cut suture tails, and instrument rests such as hemostats appear in the field between passes. Approach vectors vary slightly by frame (e.g., superiority/inferiority or left/right depending on framing), but the underlying pattern—left drives the needle, right stabilizes tissue—remains intact.

Technique development and consistency
From the first pass to the last, the closure technique remains consistent in its core approach: discrete transcutaneous passes followed by tying and trimming of individual stitches. Bite depth stays within the superficial-to-mid dermal range on the simulator, with some passes taking slightly deeper full-thickness synthetic bites when needed to optimize approximation. The operator favors short controlled arcs that allow precise placement close to the wound margin, and consistently retrieves the needle using the driver/forceps interplay. Knots are secured with multiple throws before tails are trimmed with scissors. The only notable deviation is the single brief segment where the suture track appears serpentine and resembles a continuous subcuticular running pattern; however, the predominant and recurring actions before and after that segment demonstrate separated passes and discrete knotting consistent with interrupted closure.

Final appearance and wound status
At the conclusion the wound is closed with a sequence of closely spaced interrupted stitches. Edges are well approximated with minimal eversion; the sutures hold the margins together and maintain gentle tension across the incision. Most suture tails have been trimmed and knots secured; the operator completes final adjustments and trimming in the upper-right portion of the field, then withdraws hands from direct engagement as the image shows the sutured line and a brief small central gap that persists visually on the synthetic pad. Overall, the repair is neat and uniform—instrument handling and tissue approximation throughout ensured consistent bite placement and secure knotting—leaving a clean linear closure along the same original incision from the start of the recording through its end.
