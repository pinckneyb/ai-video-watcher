COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video follows a single vertical dermal incision on the synthetic skin pad — the right‑central vertical slit (the third incision from the left, second from the right) — from the initial needle pass through the wound edge to the final tightening and trimming of suture tails. Although some frame notes occasionally reference neighboring slits or describe the incision with slightly different ordinal labels, the entire sequence consistently shows one working line on the right‑central quadrant of the pad; where descriptions conflict, those discrepancies are noted but the procedural progression below follows the wound actually manipulated throughout the clips.

Opening and initial passes (0.0–44.0 s)
The procedure opens with two gloved hands positioned immediately over the right‑central vertical incision. The needle driver approaches from above/medial while fine toothed tissue forceps approach from the lateral/distal side. A curved, swaged suture needle is secured in the driver (typically grasped at or near the body/mid‑shaft, often one‑third to one‑half from the swage). The operator orients the needle so the tip is angled downward toward the wound edge and advances it in short, wrist‑driven arcs to take a controlled bite through the near epidermal/dermal margin. The forceps present and slightly evert the near edge during the pass, stabilizing tissue and minimizing gapping. Each bite is small and precise, focused on epidermal/dermal purchase of the synthetic model rather than deep layer approximation.

Needle passage technique is consistent from the start: the driver rotates the needle through its curvature in a controlled fashion, with the tip entering perpendicular-to‑oblique relative to the pad surface and exiting through the opposite skin edge in a smooth arc. The hands remain coordinated, typically 2–6 cm apart, with the needle driver superior/medial and forceps lateral/inferior. After the first pass, the needle is retrieved by the forceps and the suture is pulled through to form the loop in preparation for tying.

Building a line of interrupted stitches (45.0–164.0 s)
Following the initial stitch, the operator repeats the same cycle to build a row of interrupted stitches along the length of the slit. Over successive passes the technique remains that of placing individual simple interrupted stitches: a bite through one edge, pass across the slit, a bite through the opposite edge, retrieval, and then suture management in preparation for knotting. Needle grips vary slightly between frames — sometimes the driver grasps the needle more proximal (closer to the swage), other times more mid‑shaft — but always sufficiently close to provide control during the arc of passage.

Tissue handling is consistently performed with fine toothed Adson‑style forceps: the near edge is lifted, slightly everted and stabilized so the needle can obtain dermal purchase with predictable depth and orientation. The synthetic dermis shows only minimal gouging from the forceps. Bites tend to be superficial-to‑full‑thickness of the practice pad (representing epidermal/dermal bites), with no engagement of deep layers. The operator focuses on edge apposition with slight eversion to promote wound edge approximation without excessive puckering.

Over this interval the stitches progress spatially along the slit: passes are made sequentially from superior toward inferior portions of the incision, and occasionally lateral to already placed rows when a stitch is added adjacent to prior material. The instrument choreography is bimanual and tight: the needle driver advances and drives the needle while the forceps present and retrieve the needle tip; their tips converge over the wound by only a few centimeters, enabling precise control during needle transfer and early knot formation.

Midcase: repetitive passes, knotting preparation (165.0–269.0 s)
As the sequence continues, multiple previously placed interrupted sutures become visible along the slit. The operator maintains the same fundamental pattern — take a bite with the curved needle, pull the suture through, prepare the limbs for tying — but the focus oscillates between placing fresh bites and securing existing sutures. Instrument position and use evolve slightly: the dominant hand (often the left in some frames and the right in others depending on camera perspective) continues to manipulate the needle driver over the wound, while the non‑dominant hand stabilizes tissue, controls suture tails, and occasionally picks up a hemostat or scissors for later cutting. Needle passes remain short and controlled; the driver frequently reorients the needle between bites to optimize exit angle and maintain consistent depth.

Tension on the sutures is managed conservatively. As stitches are tightened, wound edges come into close apposition and show only slight eversion — the operator avoids over‑tightening to limit puckering of the synthetic pad. Where the needle tip visibility is limited by instrument angle or hand positions, the operator relies on tactile feedback with the forceps and the driver’s controlled arcs to ensure adequate dermal purchase. Consistently, no deep tissue layers are engaged; the work remains cutaneous.

Finishing passes and knot tying (270.0–359.0 s)
By the mid‑to‑late portion of the video the row of interrupted sutures along the slit is well established. The operator alternates between completing remaining passes and performing knot management on recently placed stitches. Instrument exchanges are introduced as required: the needle driver is sometimes used to hold suture loops during tying while the forceps (or a hemostat) secures the opposite limb, and scissors/ligature cutters are brought in for trimming. Hands continue to operate within a close working envelope (~1–4 cm separation), often crossing briefly over the wound to manipulate loops and tails. The needle driver is occasionally repositioned to hold suture loops for additional throws, and the forceps manipulates suture ends to maintain tension and prevent tangling.

Throughout knot formation the operator maintains control of the suture orientation and tissue apposition. When tightening, the wound edges approximate with light eversion retained, and the synthetic tissue shows minimal puckering — tension appears moderate and controlled. The operator uses standard knot‑tying gestures and exchanges instruments smoothly between securing throws and cutting excess suture.

Later polishing and tail trimming (360.0–402.0 s)
In the final phase the activity shifts heavily toward securing and trimming suture tails and ensuring each interrupted stitch is snug and uniform. The row of stitches along the slit is essentially complete; the operator focuses on final throws, tightening loops, and trimming the free ends close to the knots. The needle is used less for fresh bites and more as an instrument to hold suture loops during tying; when scissors or a ligature cutter are employed the left or right hand switches briefly to that tool while the other continues to manipulate tissue or tails.

Hands and instruments flank the incision during these finishing maneuvers: the needle driver or hemostat remains above the incision while the forceps remains lateral and slightly distal, holding tissue as knots are secured. The hands are close together to facilitate a steady, coordinated action when cutting and smoothing suture tails. Any remaining suture material is tidily trimmed, and the operator double‑checks tension to ensure consistent approximation along the entire slit.

Technique characteristics and consistency
From start to finish the operator adheres to a consistent simple interrupted suturing technique using a curved, swaged needle and monofilament suture on a synthetic dermal model. The needle is consistently grasped within the driver near the body of the curve to provide control during passage; the driving motion is composed of short, controlled arcs primarily generated by wrist rotation. Tissue bites are small and precise, targeting dermal/epidermal purchase with slight eversion to encourage edge apposition and minimize inversion. Throughout, the non‑dominant hand uses fine toothed forceps to present the near edge, elevate the tissue slightly, and retrieve the needle tip as it exits the far edge.

Although the core technique is steady throughout the video, minor evolutions occur in how instruments are used: early frames show repeated fresh passes as the row is built; midframes show combined activity between finishing passes and tying; late frames focus almost entirely on knot security and tail trimming. Instrument exchanges (adding hemostats or scissors) appear increasingly in later frames as the operator transitions from placement into polishing and completion. The overall suturing approach remains methodical and controlled without abrupt changes in style or departure into alternative closure techniques.

Hand position evolution and spatial relationships
Hands maintain a predictable relationship to the wound throughout: the needle driver operates slightly above/medial to the incision, while the forceps approach from a lateral/inferior position. This geometry keeps the suture line between the two instruments and allows the tips to converge closely (often within 1–4 cm) at the point of needle transfer. As sutures are placed along the length of the slit, the hands travel in tandem up and down the wound to reach the next bite site; occasionally the operator’s hands cross over one another while repositioning or during knot tying.

Over time, roles occasionally alternate between hands depending on the specific task — for example, when a scissors or hemostat must be introduced, the dominant hand may temporarily switch from needle driving to cutting, and the non‑dominant hand steadies tissue and knots. Nonetheless, the bimanual coordination remains tight and continuous, enabling reliable needle handling and suture management. The overall spatial choreography supports efficient placement of consecutive interrupted stitches while preserving consistent tissue approximation.

Observations on consistency and limitations
Throughout the procedure the operator maintains consistent needle handling and tissue management, producing closely approximated wound edges with slight, appropriate eversion. The sutures are placed sequentially along the slit and secured with standard knot techniques and trimming at the end.

The frame descriptions exhibit occasional inconsistencies in the ordinal labeling of the slit being worked, and in a few frames the needle tip or exact knot throws are partially obscured by instruments or hand positions, which limits granular assessment of bite depth and knot configuration in those moments. Nevertheless, the visible actions demonstrate reproducible technique and methodical progression from placement through tying and trimming.

Final state
At the end of the recording the slit in the right‑central quadrant is closed with a uniform row of interrupted sutures. Wound edges lie in close apposition with slight eversion, and suture tails have been trimmed after secure knot tying. The closure appears stable, with negligible puckering or tension irregularities across the repaired length. Instruments are withdrawn from direct contact with the wound after final verification of knot security and tail length, leaving a neat, evenly approximated linear closure on the synthetic dermal pad.
