COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The sequence documents a single, focused skin closure on the low wound of the practice pad — a short horizontal/oblique incision positioned toward the lower right–lower central quadrant of the model. From the outset the operator works exclusively on that same wound throughout the recording, advancing a row of simple interrupted skin sutures and alternating deliberate needle passes with instrument tying and suture trimming until the defect is fully approximated and secured.

Initial approach and first passes (0.0–44.0 s)
The case opens with the operator positioned directly over the pad, hands close to the wound. The right hand takes primary control of the curved needle with a needle driver while the left hand steadies tissue with fine thumb forceps. The needle is routinely grasped around the mid‑shaft to distal third, held so the convex arc will carry a short, perpendicular-to‑edge bite through the synthetic dermis. The near edge is gently presented with the forceps, producing a small area of eversion as the needle is rotated in a short arc to traverse the opposite side. Bites are shallow and controlled — epidermal/dermal purchase on the silicone pad rather than deep fascial bites — demonstrating intention to achieve accurate skin edge approximation without puckering. Hands flank the incision at a tight working distance (generally 1–5 cm), with tips meeting over the wound in a tip-to-tip fashion as the needle is passed and the suture is pulled through.

As the first stitch is completed, the operator repositions the needle in the driver and uses instrument ties to secure the loop. The left forceps temporarily receives and controls the free tail while the needle driver performs additional throws. Slight adjustments of grip and needle orientation — sometimes one‑third from the swaged end, sometimes nearer the mid‑shaft — reflect fine motor corrections to follow the curved needle arc through the synthetic tissue.

Establishing a running row of interrupted stitches (45.0–150.0 s)
After the initial stitch, the operator proceeds to place additional, evenly spaced interrupted sutures along the same short line. The hand roles often alternate: in many passes the right hand (dominant) drives the needle while the left provides counter‑traction and receives the needle; in other moments the left takes the needle driver and the right manipulates the tissue or the suture tail depending on the approach angle. The needle is repeatedly grasped in a similar mid‑shaft position and oriented roughly perpendicular or slightly oblique to the wound margin to produce short dermal bites. Throughout these early segments the left hand’s forceps gently evert the near edge prior to needle entry, resulting in consistent edge apposition with slight eversion across consecutive stitches.

Needle handling is deliberate: small clockwise rotations and controlled arcs carry the needle tip through the tissue, and the operator briefly repositions the grasp to improve control as the needle nears the arc completion. Between passes the free suture tail is retrieved and tensioned with the non‑driving instrument to allow clean knot throws. Instrument crossing is common and controlled — the needle driver and forceps approach from opposite sides and often overlap directly above the wound. A scissors or hemostat sits to one side for trimming when a knot is completed.

Midcase repetition, consolidation, and small adjustments (150.0–330.0 s)
As the row advances, the operator consistently places stitches immediately adjacent to the previous ones, working from one end of the incision toward the center and lateral end in a methodical sequence. The pattern remains simple interrupted sutures placed sequentially to close gaps between earlier stitches. In some frames the needle has already been passed and the immediate activity focuses on knot tying, tail management and trimming — an indication that the workflow is a two‑step cycle: pass the needle, draw and tension the suture, secure the knot, then cut and move to the next gap.

Needle grips vary subtly to match the needle’s progress: sometimes held nearer the swage for greater rotation control, other times further down the shaft for the final pull‑through. Forceps handling of tissue remains atraumatic and precise — grasp points are small and placed at the dermal layer so as to maintain edge alignment without excess distortion. The head remains over the field for line-of-sight control, and hands remain intimately close (often 2–4 cm apart) to maintain precision during the short curved needle arcs.

Completion of additional stitches and instrument transitions (330.0–450.0 s)
The operator continues to fill the remaining gaps along the incision, placing additional interrupted sutures in the same fashion. When completing stitches at the inferior or lateral ends, instrument orientation occasionally flips: the needle driver approaches from the left in some frames and from the right in others, reflecting ergonomic adjustments as closure progresses along the short line. Bites remain superficial-to-mid‑dermal in depth, yielding consistent spacing and relatively uniform eversion of the wound margins across the series of stitches.

In multiple frames attention is given to the knot‑tying sequence. The driver secures the needle and the opposite instrument manipulates the suture tail; instrument ties and short throws are performed to lock each stitch. After adequate throws the operator uses scissors or a hemostat to trim the tails, placing the instruments temporarily to the side before resuming the next needle pass. These periodic pauses for tying and trimming punctuate the pass‑pull‑tie cycle that dominates the procedure.

Fine adjustments, re‑positioning and securement (450.0–585.0 s)
As the closure progresses toward completion, the operator inspects and adjusts individual stitches for tension and alignment. Several frames show the suture already passed and the pair of instruments busy arranging tails, tensioning loops, or completing additional throws. There is particular emphasis on creating slight eversion and even approximation: forceps are used to evert the edge while the driver secures the knot so the margin remains slightly raised rather than inverted.

Needle control becomes increasingly refined as the operator finishes the last open gaps. Grips on the curved needle are frequently repositioned — sometimes nearer the tip to withdraw the needle cleanly after a pass, sometimes more central for rotational control through tissue. The consistent use of small, perpendicular-to‑edge bites and the repetition of instrument tying maintain closure uniformity along the entire short line.

Final passes, trimming, and inspection (585.0–628.0 s)
In the closing minutes the operator focuses on securing the last remaining stitches and tidying the area. The workflow is dominated by knot throws, tail control, and final suture trimming; the needle is seldom passed across fresh tissue in these frames because most gaps have already been closed. Instruments are withdrawn and set aside as the last knots are completed. Hands remain close to the wound during final manipulation — the non‑driving forceps holding suture tails while the needle driver performs the last securing maneuvers and tail cuts.

Throughout the final sequence there is a repetitive pattern: the needle driver holds and controls the needle or residual suture while the other instrument manages tissue alignment and tail handling. The head stays over the field until both instruments are removed and the wound is inspected visually.

Overall technique and its evolution
From first to last, the operator employs a consistent simple interrupted technique across the entire short incision. Needle handling remains uniform in principle: a curved, swaged needle is used with mid‑shaft or slightly distal grips for passage, with orientation set to achieve short, perpendicular or slightly oblique dermal bites. Bites are superficially placed in the dermis in order to produce precise skin edge apposition and modest eversion. This approach remains steady; the technique evolves only in subtle ergonomic adjustments (changing which hand holds the driver, minor repositioning of the grasp on the needle shaft) to maintain control as different sections of the line are addressed.

Hand positions and instrument choreography
Hands consistently flank the incision and work within a tight workspace of roughly 1–5 cm between instrument tips. The commonly observed pattern is driver in the dominant hand delivering the needle and forceps in the nondominant hand presenting, stabilizing and everting the near edge, then receiving and tensioning the suture. Occasionally these roles reverse depending on approach angle or to gain better visibility for a particular bite. Instruments often cross directly above the wound during needle passage and knot tying; this overlap is controlled and brief, intended to maintain precise alignment rather than to create entanglement. When tying, one instrument frequently switches to a ring‑handled hemostat or long clamp for instrument ties. Scissors lie nearby and are used intermittently to trim tails after securing knots.

Spatial relationships relative to the incision remain constant: the operator remains over the field, hands close together, moving incrementally along the wound in a sequential pattern from one end toward the other, filling gaps with evenly spaced interrupted sutures and returning to tie and trim each as needed.

Consistency and quality of closure
Across the recording the closure demonstrates a high degree of consistency: similar bite depths, even spacing, and slight eversion of edges are hallmarks of the technique. Needle handling, suture tensioning and knot security are approached with deliberate, controlled motions that minimize trauma to the synthetic tissue model. When knot work dominates the frame, it is clear the operator is ensuring security before trimming tails, and when multiple stitches are placed in succession the operator maintains uniformity of bite placement and tension.

Final appearance and state of the wound
At the conclusion the short lower wound is closed with a completed row of evenly spaced, secured interrupted sutures. The wound edges are well apposed with modest eversion, no appreciable gapping, and short trimmed tails lying close to the surface. Instruments are withdrawn and placed to the side, the operator’s head lifts from the immediate field, and the repaired incision appears stable and uniformly approximated along its length.

Summary
Throughout the recording a single short lower wound was closed by sequential placement of simple interrupted skin sutures. The operator repeatedly employed a curved suture needle with mid‑shaft grasping in a needle driver and used fine tissue forceps to present and evert wound edges. The work proceeded methodically along the same incision: pass the needle, retrieve and tension the suture, perform instrument ties, trim tails, and move to the next gap. Hands and instruments operated in a compact, coordinated space directly over the wound, with minor role swapping and needle‑grip adjustments to address ergonomic needs. The result is a neatly approximated wound with consistent bite depth, eversion, and secure knot‑tie finishes along the entire short incision.
