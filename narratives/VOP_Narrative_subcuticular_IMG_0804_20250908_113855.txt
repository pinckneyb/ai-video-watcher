COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
As the video opens (0–14 s), the scene is centered on the middle laceration of a synthetic skin pad. The right hand, with Adson forceps, steadies and slightly everts the near/right edge while the left hand presents a curved needle in a needle driver. The needle is held about one-third from the swaged end, presented perpendicular to the epidermis, then advanced by wrist rotation in a smooth arc. The tip emerges on the opposite (left) edge where the forceps briefly assist the exit and hand-off. The left hand re-grasps the needle to complete the arc and draw the suture through, preserving a long tail and leaving both ends on opposite sides of the incision, edges gently approximated.

Immediately afterward (15–29 s), the same controlled mechanics are reinforced: symmetric bite depth and width, gentle traction to bring the edges together, and clean suture management kept mostly out of the field. The right hand transitions from edge control to assisting with an instrument tie—using forceps to retrieve and pass the free end while the left-hand driver forms loops. Throws are alternated and seated low over the incision, each tightened with opposing, horizontal tension to square the knot without crushing the skin. The knot sits centrally with slight eversion maintained.

A short interlude follows (30–44 s) in which instruments cross over the incision as the surgeon repositions. The right hand still carries a gold-handled driver; the left hand alternates between forceps and an assisting instrument, then introduces scissors toward the end of this segment. The suture lies slack across the wound in a broad loop, suggesting housekeeping—organizing the strand, checking lay, and preparing to cut or transition—rather than active tissue passage. The wound edges are not manipulated here; the focus is above-field instrument exchange and setup.

The next stitch begins (45–59 s) with roles temporarily reversed: the right hand now holds the needle driver and takes the first bite on the right edge, entering a few millimeters from the margin. The left hand does not use pickups here; instead, the left index finger provides gentle traction to evert the right edge as the needle is driven through the dermis into the wound. The driver repositions mid-pass to keep the needle on its curve, delivering the tip into the wound lumen.

Progressing to the lower/right portion of the incision (60–74 s), the setup returns to the more typical posture—left hand on the driver, right on fine forceps. The needle is reloaded at the proximal third, approached perpendicular to the surface, and advanced through the dermis. After partial passage, the needle is regrasped to complete the arc and exit, and the suture is drawn through smoothly, leaving a long free end. No tying is shown yet; the operator is building the stitch.

That passage continues (75–89 s). The right hand uses forceps to evert the right edge and then to catch the needle tip as it exits the far side. The left-hand driver re-grasps the needle to pull the strand through, leaving a short tail at the entry side. Instruments stay aligned within the wound plane, and the suture loop rides superiorly while the pass is completed—again without tying in this sequence.

By the next interval (90–104 s), both sides of a simple interrupted are complete. The left hand drives the needle across, following the curvature; the right hand, with Adsons, everts and stabilizes the edges at each penetration and exit. Bites are kept symmetric and dermal, the suture is drawn through under control, and the edges come together with gentle eversion. The final frames of this pass show the strand lifted out of the way, setting up for knot tying.

The camera then captures an additional, well-orchestrated pass (105–119 s): outside-in on the far (left) edge followed by inside-out on the near (right) edge. The forceps help visualize and present each margin; the needle is re-grasped after emergence and the suture pulled through, leaving a trailing strand ready for tying. Throughout, the left-hand driver advances the needle perpendicular to the surface and in a smooth arc, with the right hand maintaining delicate edge control.

Before tying, the surgeon tidies the field (120–134 s). The left-hand driver repositions the needle perpendicular to the next target site while the right hand, intermittently holding forceps, removes slack from the strand and everts the right edge. Working distance is tight but coordinated; instrument tips meet at the margin without crowding, and the suture is routed away from the wound to avoid snagging.

The tie for this stitch follows (135–149 s). The needle remains on the long end but is parked out of the immediate field while the left-hand driver controls the strand near the knot. The right hand uses forceps to maintain approximation and slight eversion, then the long end is looped over the driver. The driver grasps the short tail, advances the loop down, and the throw is tightened horizontally across the incision. Subsequent throws alternate direction, squaring and locking the knot low at the epidermal surface. The edges remain neatly apposed with mild eversion.

With a rhythm now established, the next stitch is set up and passed (150–164 s). The left hand reloads the needle with the curve oriented right-to-left; the right hand with pickups everts the dermal margin 1–3 mm from the edge. The driver advances with a controlled supination to follow the needle’s arc, while the forceps guide the tip and briefly grasp the needle to aid delivery. Gentle vertical tension seats the prior stitch and maintains approximation as the new pass is drawn through.

Knot tying resumes (165–179 s). The short and long ends are separated, the driver performs instrument ties with alternating loop directions, and the right-hand forceps continue to maintain edge eversion as each throw is laid down. The knot is advanced and seated squarely over the incision, preserving approximation without gapping or crush.

In the next cycle (180–194 s), the flow is streamlined: after the needle is passed and the suture drawn through, the right-hand forceps briefly secure the needle tip for removal from the field, allowing the left-hand driver to focus on grasping the free end for instrument ties. Throws are tightened in opposite directions, bringing the epidermal edges together with slight eversion. Once secured, the needle is reloaded for the subsequent stitch.

A close-up tying sequence follows (195–209 s), highlighting knot control. The left-hand driver pinches the standing part near the wound, acting as both grasper and knot pusher, while the right hand manipulates the tail to form loops and deliver the end to the driver. After each throw, tension is applied along the axis of the incision, alternating hands to keep the knot flat and low, with no visible tissue crush. The wound at this point is largely approximated by prior interrupted stitches.

With the knot secured, the team trims and resets (210–224 s). The right-hand driver stabilizes near the completed knot while the left hand brings in scissors to trim the tails close. Immediately after cutting, attention turns to reloading: the driver grasps the curved needle on its proximal third-to-mid-shaft and, with the assisting hand, orients it perpendicular to the surface and facing the intended direction of travel for the next bite.

The sequence closes with final preparation (225–235 s). The right hand presents the needle by the body to the left-hand driver, sets gentle vertical tension on the freshly tied knot to confirm seating, and then repositions the needle to the right side of the wound, ready for the next pass. Hands alternate smoothly without crossing over the incision, keeping the field clear and centered.

Across the video, the flow is methodical and consistent: precise needle loading and perpendicular entries; arcs that respect needle curvature; forceps used to evert and stabilize; suture drawn through with minimal drag; then clean, alternating instrument ties that are advanced deliberately down to the wound. The operator periodically reorganizes the field—managing slack, parking the needle during ties, trimming tails, and reloading—before repeating the cycle. Hand roles shift when helpful, but the choreography stays constant: opposing hands working across the incision, tension balanced in opposite directions, knots kept low and square, and edges brought together with gentle eversion, stitch by stitch, along the central laceration.
