COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
This sequence documents a single, continuous skin closure using a simple interrupted technique on the midline incision of a silicone suture pad. Although the pad contains other practice cuts and some frames describe the active segment with slightly different orientations (short vertical, briefly horizontal, small square), the work proceeds along the same central wound, closing it in evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches from center toward the ends. Where labeling or orientation appears inconsistent, the handling, instrument positions, and continuity of the suture row confirm the same repair is being carried forward.

The procedure opens with setup and the first pass on the midline wound. The operator approaches the lower‑central portion of the line with the needle mounted correctly in the driver (held roughly two‑thirds from the tip, curve oriented perpendicular to the skin). The opposite hand uses Adson forceps to steady and evert the edge at the intended entry point. With the edge presented, the needle is driven in a controlled arc across the incision and retrieved on the far side, preserving perpendicular entry and exit to create symmetric dermal bites that will evert the edges on tie‑down.

With that initial transfixion complete, the operator transitions immediately to instrument ties over the center of the wound. The driver is used to form loops and grasp the opposing strand; the free hand alternates tension on the standing and working ends to walk the knot down and square it at midline. The needle is “parked” in the driver during knotting to keep the point under control. After the first set of throws is seated and alternated, scissors briefly enter to trim the ends, leaving short, neat tails and a well‑seated knot centered on the line. At this point, one completed simple interrupted stitch is present across the midline incision.

The next stitch is placed slightly inferior on the same wound. The driver again approaches with the needle held on the proximal‑to‑mid body of the curve, perpendicular to the pad. In this pass the operator works without forceps, using gentle counter‑tension on the thread to keep the tissue stable while taking symmetric bites. After the needle is pulled through and regrasped near the tip to deliver the suture, instrument ties are again executed above the incision. The loops are formed and laid across the gap, alternating directions to square the knot, with the free end posted and the driver delivering each throw. The knot is snugged down centrally; tails are cut on completion. This second stitch brings the total along the midline wound to two.

With those first two sutures in place, the field shifts slightly but remains on the same central line. In one segment, the incision appears more transverse in the frame, a function of camera angle and pad orientation, yet the technique and relationship of instruments to the same wound are unchanged: the driver positions the needle to pass orthogonally across the gap while the opposite hand—now with forceps—everts the edge and then helps retrieve the needle and pull the strand through. The stitch is tied with two instruments in coordinated fashion, one acting as the post (holding the standing end steady) while the other delivers the throws. The knot is walked down to the center of the wound and alternated to lock. After trimming, a third simple interrupted is secured on the same line, increasing the total to three.

Over the next series of frames, the operator revisits the recent knots to add additional throws and ensure squaring and lock. These segments show the driver crossing over the incision with the loop, the free hand holding the post and then alternating tension to flatten and seat the knot flush with the epidermal surface. No new bites are taken during these moments; the needle remains parked, and the work is a controlled refinement and final tightening of knots already placed. Scissors appear intermittently from the left to trim tails to consistent length, while the driver re‑loads the needle in preparation for the next region. The count remains at three completed sutures.

Attention then moves along the same midline incision, where the center third is now coapted with several knots and mild surrounding puckering. The left hand typically holds the needle driver just left and superior to the line; the right hand manipulates the suture tail or forceps on the right edge, depending on whether a bite or a tie is in progress. When a bite is being prepared on the inferior segment, the right hand’s Adsons gently grasp the right dermal lip to lift and evert it. The needle, held in the driver at the proximal third of the arc, is oriented perpendicular to the skin and presented to enter on the right and exit on the left, maintaining symmetric bite depth. After passage, the driver transitions to instrument ties with the free end, while the forceps either release or help control the standing end during the laydown. Throughout these motions, the wound edges approximate without crushing, and eversion is preserved by correct bite placement and measured tension.

Knot tying proceeds with the needle still in the driver (“parked”) for safety. The right hand brings the working end across the incision to form a throw; the driver’s jaws grasp the free end and sweep the loop down. Alternating the direction of subsequent throws squares and locks the knot. At the lower end, as the throws are laid and cinched, the inferior margins approximate with gentle puckering—an expected effect signaling coaptation without excessive strangulation. By the end of this sequence of tying at the inferior end, the fourth interrupted stitch has been fully integrated into the row. The count increases from three to four completed simple interrupted sutures.

With four knots now visible along the midline cut, the surgeon prepares to finish the remaining small gap toward the superior end. Scissors enter briefly to trim the tails of the most recent knot while the opposite hand maintains tension proximal to the knot to prevent loosening. The needle holder is then re‑gripped, the needle reset at the proximal third with the curve perpendicular to the wound surface, and the forceps return to evert the next bite site. The driver works from the left of the wound; the forceps oppose from the right, triangulating across the slit to maintain a consistent working distance and good visibility of entry and exit points.

The final bite is taken with the needle advancing in a smooth arc across the superior gap. The forceps lift each edge just enough to avoid taking too superficial a bite and to keep the tip from skiving; the needle exits on the far side, where it is regrasped near the tip and delivered through. The suture is drawn through to eliminate loops; then the operator again uses instrument ties. The driver crosses over the incision to pick up the free end, and successive throws are alternated in direction to square the knot. The free hand posts and tensions the standing end to guide the knot straight down onto the wound without slippage. Once the knot is seated, additional throws are added to lock it, after which scissors cut the tails to match the earlier stitches.

With that, five simple interrupted sutures span the central incision, evenly spaced with mild radial wrinkling that reflects appropriate tension and edge eversion. The driver briefly sweeps over the row, checking that each knot sits flat and centered over the incision line and that no gapping persists between stitches. In the final moments, no hands are present; the camera shows a static field with the repaired midline incision centered and five completed interrupted stitches in place.

Throughout the case, several elements of technique remain consistent despite shifts in hand dominance and minor changes in camera perspective:

- Needle handling is disciplined and correct. The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid‑shaft, preserving curvature and control. Entry is perpendicular to the pad surface, guiding a smooth rotational pass that avoids tearing.

- Edge control favors eversion and gentle handling. When forceps are used, they grasp the dermis lightly at the edge rather than crushing the epidermis, lifting the lip just enough to present the bite and protect from shallow passes. When forceps are not used, the non‑driver hand imposes counter‑tension on the thread to stabilize the tissue.

- Instrument ties are the primary knotting method. The driver is used to form and deliver loops; the opposing hand posts the standing end and alternates tension to square each throw. The needle is “parked” in the driver during tying to control the point. When two instruments are used, one acts as a post while the other delivers throws, then they reverse roles to alternate direction.

- Spatial choreography is consistent. The driver usually works just left/superior to the wound while the assisting hand is right/inferior, opposing across the incision. During tying, the driver and the working end cross above the incision; during cutting, scissors approach from the left as the other hand maintains light tension proximal to the knot.

- The closure sequence follows the classic interrupted pattern. After establishing central approximation, successive stitches are added adjacent to prior knots, first inferiorly and then superiorly, preserving spacing and alignment until the small remaining gaps are closed.

A few frames contain inconsistent labels about incision orientation or site (e.g., short vertical slit vs. short horizontal slit vs. small square segment). These likely reflect camera rotation and selective framing of portions of the same midline cut on the practice pad rather than a change of target wound. The handling, instrument relationships, and the cumulative presence of knots along the same centrally located line confirm continuity. Additionally, some mid‑procedure counts appear lower within cropped views that only show a subsegment or focus on one knot being finished; when the entire line is re‑captured in later frames, the cumulative count aligns with the chronological progression.

Suture count progression across the closure:
- After the first central knot is secured and trimmed, there is 1 completed stitch.
- A second stitch is placed and tied on the same line, bringing the total to 2.
- A third interrupted stitch is added in the adjacent segment and tied, total 3.
- Inferiorly, another stitch is tied down and integrated with the row, increasing the total to 4.
- Superiorly, the final gap is closed with a fifth stitch, which is tied and trimmed.

Final verification:
- In the last static views, the midline incision shows five completed simple interrupted sutures. The edges are approximated with mild, even puckering, and no active manipulation is occurring.

In summary, the operator closes a straight midline skin incision on a suture pad using the simple interrupted technique. The closure begins centrally and proceeds to adjacent positions, with careful attention to perpendicular needle entry, symmetric bites, edge eversion, and secure instrument ties. Hand positions adapt fluidly—driver left or right as needed—while maintaining consistent cross‑incision choreography and safe control of the needle. The procedure results in 5 completed sutures spanning the incision, documented clearly in the final frames.
