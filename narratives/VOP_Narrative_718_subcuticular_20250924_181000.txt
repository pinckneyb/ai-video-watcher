COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session unfolds on a synthetic skin pad that is firmly fixed to a wooden block, with several practice slits visible around the field. Despite those additional cuts, the closure work proceeds on a single straight horizontal wound traversing the pad near the center. The operator returns to this same line again and again, building out a sequence of properly oriented, perpendicular passes with methodical instrument ties while occasionally pausing to reset, reload, or briefly clear suture elsewhere on the pad. The closure reflects the selected technique throughout; where the footage shows brief excursions to other practice cuts or fleeting elements that resemble alternate patterns, those segments do not ultimately alter or replace the ongoing plan for this wound and serve more as housekeeping or side demonstrations before the operator continues on the same primary line.

The procedure begins with the central horizontal incision identified and stabilized. The right hand holds a gold-handled needle driver, the left hand an Adson-style tissue forceps. The needle is mounted roughly two-thirds from the tip and is presented orthogonally to the incision. The left forceps gently lifts and everts the near edge, defining a crisp entry point a few millimeters back from the margin. With a controlled wrist rotation, the right hand advances the curved needle through the near dermis, following the arc. The left hand then elevates the far edge to help guide an orthogonal exit. The instrument tips remain only millimeters from the wound, and the needle’s path crosses the line cleanly at 90 degrees. The suture is drawn through in a measured fashion to initiate the first pass, preparing for securing without yet committing to a knot at this moment.

As the work continues along the same line, the operator alternates hands and approaches, but the wound itself does not change. In the next sequence, the needle driver is in the left hand while the right hand uses the forceps to control the edges. The driver stays just superior and left-of-center relative to the same horizontal slit, and the suture is passed across the gap. The forceps guide the needle through the near then far dermis with slight eversion. The move from a right-hand to a left-hand drive doesn’t alter the technique fundamentals: perpendicular entry and exit, controlled arcs, and gentle tissue handling that avoids crushing while presenting each edge in turn. The thread is drawn through to bring the edges toward approximation, then managed to prevent tangling as the operator regrips for the subsequent pass.

A very brief interlude then shows the operator initiating a knot on an oblique practice cut elsewhere on the pad. This looks like a didactic detour rather than a change of plan—an isolated demonstration of how a pass and early knot might look on a diagonal slit. That knotting action is not developed further there, and the footage quickly returns to the same horizontal wound for ongoing closure. Back at the primary incision, the operator again maintains orthogonal needle entry and smooth, wrist-driven arcs. The driver is typically held superior to the incision while the forceps oppose from below, then the positions swap as needed to maintain a clean approach. The suture is kept off the working field—generally to the right—and draped to avoid snagging. In this portion, the operator advances laterally along the same line, placing another pass while preserving consistent depth and spacing across the edges. The thread is drawn through fully and tensioned just enough to approximate, without strangulating the tissue.

Another short housekeeping segment follows: the operator clears and withdraws loose suture from a nearby L-shaped practice cut. No bites are taken there, and once the field is clean the focus resumes—again—on the same straight horizontal incision.

The next several passages reinforce good habits. The forceps often begin on the far edge to define an entry and ensure eversion, with the driver placing a near-perpendicular bite across toward the near side. Regrasping is done carefully—often around the proximal third of the needle—to preserve the curvature, and the needle is retrieved smoothly on the opposite side. The driver commonly transitions from a shallow angle to a vertical orientation as the needle is pulled through, which helps protect the tissue from lateral shear forces. Throughout, the forceps lift the edge lightly rather than crushing it, and where needed they regrip the needle near the tip for repositioning under direct visualization. Scissors are visible on the field at several points but largely remain idle; when picked up, they are typically handled without actually cutting suture in those particular frames.

As the closure progresses, the operator’s hand dominance changes several times. There are sequences with the right hand driving and the left stabilizing tissue, alternated with frames where the left takes the driver and the right hand handles the forceps. The changes accommodate access and line of sight as the stitches move along the wound from center toward the right and left segments. In all cases, the needle is presented perpendicular to the wound, and the forceps are used to create slight eversion so each edge will meet evenly. This remains consistent even when the operator reloads the needle more than once to refine the angle of attack. At times, the driver is switched out for a moment to allow the assistant hand to take the needle, tease it out of the exit site, and hand it back at a better angle for continued passage.

A critical transition appears mid-sequence: after several passes, the operator secures one of the stitches at the mid-portion of the incision. Here both hands hold needle drivers to execute an instrument tie. One instrument forms the loop while the other maintains tension, and the knot is seated with deliberate, even downforce. The knot is placed lateral to the incision, away from the wound edges, to avoid strangulation and to keep the knot stack clear of the reapproximated margins. Following the securement, the needle is reloaded and the closure continues a short distance to the right of that knot. The operator’s right hand then reverts to using forceps to lift and present the edges while the left driver advances the next bite. The technique remains consistent: bites are symmetric in depth, perpendicular to the wound, and placed with a smooth wrist motion.

Subsequent frames reinforce the rhythm of the closure. A pass is started on the right half of the wound; the suture is pulled through, and preparations are made for tying. At times, a second instrument helps draw the suture through, ensuring the thread does not snag on the dermal surface. Where the footage shows a momentary emphasis on one side of the wound—the right or the left—the forceps then shift across, elevating the opposite edge to receive the exit of the needle. The operator pauses to regrip the needle in the driver, adjusting the grasp point to the proximal third or mid-body to maintain control as the curve is driven through. Small deviations in grasp point are corrected by promptly reloading to a more secure, traditional hold. The suture tails are kept organized on the right side to minimize entanglement with the driver during throws.

Another stitch is then fully placed and secured with instrument throws on the right side of the wound. Loops are formed with the driver while the opposing hand maintains taut, steady counter-tension. The knot is seated snugly without overtightening. The operator then retrieves and reloads the needle to continue along the same line, moving incrementally leftward for the next placement. A similar sequence repeats at the right end of the wound: a stitch is placed near the right extremity, instrument ties are completed, and then the needle is picked back up, reloaded, and oriented for continuing passes.

There is one segment where the camera captures a brief excursion at the right lateral edge of the pad where a separate, slightly curved vertical cut is visible; pickups lift that edge but no new stitch is completed there during those moments. This appears to be a short-lived repositioning or an off-target exploration rather than a change of plan, and the footage returns to the same horizontal wound for ongoing closure.

As the work resumes on the central horizontal incision, the roles again swap fluidly. In one sequence the left hand now holds the driver over the wound while the right hand’s pickups present the right wound edge for a clean perpendicular entry. The operator refines the approach angle, aligns the arc, and initiates the next bite. The suture is visible and actively managed to the side of the field, ensuring a clear pathway for the needle. A subsequent series shows the right hand alternating between a needle holder and scissors, but the dominant activity remains needle handling and tissue control; scissors remain largely unused for cutting during these scenes.

Approaching the later stages of the captured footage, the operator initiates another bite along the same central line, with the left hand tenting the edge and the driver working from above. The needle tip is aligned to enter the near edge cleanly, and the arc is set to traverse the wound at 90 degrees, while the opposing hand prepares the far edge for exit. The choreography remains tight: instrument tips close to the margin, smooth rotation through the tissue, and gentle counter-traction on the receiving edge. The suture is drawn through without jerking to prevent tearing or cheese-wiring.

In the next interval, motion slows. The right hand hovers over the right half of the wound, briefly using a fine tissue forceps to lift the edge and then bringing in a needle holder in the same hand. The left hand stabilizes the field intermittently. This looks like a pause for planning and setup at another segment of the same line rather than an active pass; no needle traversal or knotting is completed in that brief window.

Finally, there is a still frame showing the same straight central slit on the pad without hands present and without overt approximation visible at that instant; instruments rest off to the side. The suture strand lies on the table on the right, without tension. This appears to be a momentary pause or a reset shot rather than a reflection of the full progress made earlier in the session, which clearly documented multiple placed and secured stitches on the wound. The camera may have shifted to a fresh, untouched portion of the pad between actions, producing a static view that does not contradict but also does not fully display the cumulative closure achieved on the primary incision during the active sequences.

Across the entire session, the technique remains faithful to the selected approach:

- Needle handling: The needle is consistently grasped near the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, with frequent reloading to optimize the arc. Entry is kept perpendicular to the pad surface, and advancement is by wrist rotation rather than straight pushing. The driver often turns vertical as the needle is retrieved to protect tissue. Where needed, the forceps momentarily grasp the needle to complete pull-through or help control the curve.

- Tissue handling: The forceps are used to lift rather than crush the dermis, creating a slight eversion of the wound margins. Bites are placed a small, even distance from the edge and at symmetrical depth across the wound. Traction is minimal and coordinated with needle passage so that both the near and far lips are stabilized in turn.

- Suture management and tying: The suture is intentionally draped laterally (often to the right) to reduce the risk of catching loops with the driver. When a stitch is secured, the operator uses instrument throws with alternating directions to square the knot and seats it laterally, away from the incision line, to avoid impeding edge approximation. Tension is applied evenly to approximate without strangulation. Throughout, scissors remain nearby but do not feature prominently in the captured tying maneuvers.

- Spatial relationships and hand evolution: The operator frequently changes which hand drives the needle to gain the best perpendicular approach and visualization at each segment of the wound. The instruments straddle the incision, with tips remaining within a few millimeters of the margins. At times, both hands hold needle drivers for instrument ties; at others, the non-dominant hand uses Adson forceps or fine pickups to elevate and guide the tissue.

There are occasional deviations visible in the footage—brief manipulation of an oblique cut, clearing suture from an L-shaped incision, a short look at a lateral vertical slit, and one sequence that displays a running-like advancement before reverting to discrete, tied stitches. These moments represent either housekeeping on nearby practice cuts or short demonstrations and do not alter the ongoing closure plan on the primary straight horizontal incision. Where such interludes appear, the operator promptly returns to the same wound and continues with the same stepwise, perpendicular-bite, instrument-tied progression.

By the close of the recorded session, the wound has been advanced with multiple well-aligned stitches, at least several of which are visibly secured with instrument ties positioned lateral to the line. Intervening bites have been passed and drawn through with care to maintain eversion and symmetric depth. The final static shot captures a pause rather than a definitive endpoint; it does not display the earlier tied portions, suggesting the field view shifted while the operator reset. Taken together, the actions demonstrate a consistent application of the selected suturing technique on a single straight horizontal incision: precise needle placement orthogonal to the skin, gentle edge eversion with forceps, careful suture management, and secure, appropriately seated knots that progressively approximate the wound. Remaining segments of the line awaiting closure would be readily completed by continuing the same pattern along the unclosed length, maintaining the same spacing, bite depth, and knot security exhibited throughout this procedure.
