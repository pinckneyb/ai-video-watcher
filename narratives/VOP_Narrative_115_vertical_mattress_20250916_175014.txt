============================================================
Overview and setup
The procedure takes place on a silicone skin pad with three parallel vertical slits. Throughout, the work of interest is the closure of the right‑of‑center vertical incision using a continuous running technique. Other slits on the pad—most notably the midline incision that carries a row of simple interrupted knots and, at one point, a left‑side slit—come into view intermittently as background or separate practice closures. These non‑active slits are not part of the running closure being documented here and are excluded from suture counts for the procedure. Where the camera briefly lingers on those other lines, it shows tying, adjusting, and trimming of interrupted stitches on the midline, but that activity is distinct from the continuous line on the right‑of‑center wound we follow from initiation to its final state.

Initiation of the running closure on the right‑of‑center incision
The closure begins on the right‑of‑center vertical incision with initial needle positioning and the first pass. In the early segment (30.0–44.0 s), the upper hand holds the needle driver and the lower hand uses forceps to stabilize and gently lift the right wound edge. The curved needle is grasped at its mid–distal third, held perpendicular to the skin surface, and advanced into the right edge to start a right‑to‑left pass. At this point there are no completed throws or knots along this incision; the suture thread arcs widely across the field as the first bite is initiated. Hand opposition is classic: the driver works from above, the assisting forceps from below, converging across the incision to control entry and trajectory.

Building the line: early–mid course with four to five completed passes
As the line progresses into mid‑procedure, several segments show the running closure established with multiple completed bites. In one mid sequence (345.0–359.0 s), the right hand enters from the right holding a needle driver over the mid‑portion of this wound. The left hand is largely out of frame and no pickups are engaging tissue during this brief interval. The driver hovers over the wound, angled across it, consistent with preparation for the next pass. Five completed running bites are already visible, crossing the incision with consistent spacing; no new bite is executed during these specific frames. The wound edges are apposed by these existing loops without significant eversion tools in use at that instant.

A closely related interval (360.0–374.0 s) captures the team actively securing the next segment. The left hand holds the needle driver vertically over the superior‑middle part of the same incision; the right hand uses tissue forceps just lateral to the wound edge. The driver alternates between holding the needle and using its jaws to assist in tying. Before this pass is secured there are four completed crossings; as the bite is snugged, the fifth loop is being seated. Tissue handling remains gentle: the right‑hand forceps steady the near edge modestly while tension is applied on the strand to set each loop. At this stage, there is methodical advancement toward the superior end with consistent depth and lateral offset.

Preparation and advancement with six completed bites
As work moves further superiorly, the operator continues the running closure with consistent technique and spacing. In the sequence 420.0–434.0 s, attention is on the right incision’s running line: the needle driver hovers directly over this wound and the forceps lift the near wound edge to evert and clearly present tissue for the next pass. The needle is grasped at the proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the wound axis, ready for a forehand bite. Six completed stitches are visible along the running line, suggesting a well‑established sequence of evenly spaced throws. In these frames the team is repositioning instruments; the next pass is being set up but not completed within this snippet.

A little later (465.0–479.0 s), the dominant hand holds the driver above the wound while the nondominant hand alternates between Adsons and a second driver to manage the loop—an approach that helps maintain precise tension control along a running line. The needle is grasped about one‑third from the swage, oriented nearly perpendicular. The operator reloads between bites and advances along the incision, the left hand managing the suture loop and tension. The edges are lifted gently and the needle passes full‑thickness across opposing dermal margins. At this stage, six completed running bites are visible, and an additional bite is being placed.

Consolidating progression near the superior half
In the upper half of the wound, several sequences focus on tensioning and securing progression without immediately adding new tissue passes. At 525.0–539.0 s, a continuous running closure is already established. The needle is oriented to take the next superior bite, and the operator begins an instrument tie to secure progression at that point—a technique sometimes used to stabilize the line temporarily as the operator repositions or to manage tension evenly as the run approaches the end. Six completed running segments remain visible during this interval. In 540.0–554.0 s, both hands briefly hold needle holders before they are set down. The right hand then returns alone to tension the running strand over the right slit, managing the line’s lay and ensuring even apposition without any new passes in these frames. Six completed bites are again documented during this tensioning and management period.

Continuing the run: from six to seven completed passes
The next segment (555.0–569.0 s) shows the right hand with the needle driver working over the superior portion of the wound; the left hand alternates between tensioning the free suture and briefly using scissors/driver to manage loops. The needle is held at the proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the wound, and advanced near the superior end to add another bite. While the bite is placed and tightened, the cumulative count during this short interval remains six completed loops; the new bite is being positioned and drawn through but is not yet counted as completed in these frames.

By 570.0–584.0 s, the effect of the preceding work is visible: seven completed passes are now present along the right‑of‑center running line. The right hand, sometimes with a blue‑handled driver, approaches from the superior aspect, continuing to tighten and set the line along the superior half. No forceps are used here; instead, the operator tensions the strand to seat the run and ensure even approximation.

Final state and pause with instruments off the field
The final frames (585.0–590.0 s) show a paused field with no hands present. The right‑of‑center incision lies closed with a continuous line whose zig‑zag crosses are evenly spaced along the wound. A needle driver holding a curved needle with attached suture rests at the lower right of the field, the curvature oriented to sweep from right to left when next used. Crucially, eight completed throws/bites are clearly visible along this continuous line at this final pause, with the wound edges lying well‑approximated. Forceps and another instrument rest away from the area. No new pass is taken during this brief endpoint, so this image serves as the definitive count for the final state of the closure.

Instrument handling and spatial choreography throughout the run
Across the running closure, the operator maintains consistent instrument ergonomics and tissue respect:

- Needle handling and driver control: The needle is typically grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body and presented perpendicular to the skin surface. The surgeon uses pronation/supination of the wrist to carry the curve through the near and far dermal edges. Between passes, the needle is reloaded to maintain a correct angle of attack. At times, especially when tensioning the line, the driver’s jaws serve briefly as a guide or “post” to control loop lay and direction during instrument‑assisted tying maneuvers intended to stabilize progression.

- Forceps use and tissue interaction: The nondominant hand uses Adsons intermittently to lift and evert the wound edge, particularly during passes shown at 420.0–434.0 s and 465.0–479.0 s. In other intervals—especially during tensioning closer to the superior end (540.0–584.0 s)—no forceps are used; approximation is maintained by the existing loops while the operator manages the running strand’s tension.

- Hand positions and opposition: Consistently, hands oppose each other across the incision with the driver typically just above and slightly right of the wound and the assisting hand slightly inferior/medial or lateral, depending on the pass direction. This opposition helps present tissue, set depth and bite width symmetrically, and maintain clear visualization of the entry and exit points. As the run advances superiorly, the driver’s working position migrates up the line, and the assisting hand’s role transitions from active eversion to primarily tension management and strand control.

- Tension and progression: The surgeon is attentive to maintaining even tension across the running line. Several intervals emphasize tensioning, laying down the line neatly, and securing progression without taking a new bite in that exact clip. This strategy prevents dog‑ears and maintains uniform approximation as the run approaches its terminus.

Notes on other visible incisions (not part of this closure)
Intermittently, the camera shows work on the central midline incision using a simple interrupted technique—tying, seating, adjusting, and trimming knots—at several timepoints (for example, 45.0–59.0 s; 60.0–74.0 s; 75.0–89.0 s; 90.0–104.0 s; 105.0–119.0 s; 120.0–134.0 s; 150.0–164.0 s; 165.0–179.0 s; 180.0–194.0 s; 195.0–209.0 s; 210.0–224.0 s; 225.0–239.0 s; 240.0–254.0 s; 270.0–314.0 s; 315.0–344.0 s; 375.0–404.0 s; 435.0–449.0 s; 450.0–494.0 s; 495.0–509.0 s; 510.0–524.0 s). Those sequences depict a separate line with a growing number of discrete knots (often five to seven) and, in one brief segment, instrument‑tie finishing at the end of a continuous segment. Because the active procedure here is the continuous running closure of the right‑of‑center incision, those midline‑closure details are not counted toward the running line’s totals. Similarly, an even briefer look at a left slit (135.0–149.0 s) shows isolated interrupted passes; that too is distinct from the running closure we track.

Suture count progression on the right‑of‑center running line
Within the right‑of‑center incision—the sole line considered in this procedure—the suture count evolves as follows, based strictly on the segments where this incision is in view:

- 30.0–44.0 s: Initiation; no completed bites yet; first pass is being taken from right to left at the lower half.
- 360.0–374.0 s: Four completed loops precede the bite being secured; by the end of this interval, the fifth is being seated. A nearby segment (345.0–359.0 s) shows five already completed and the team pausing above the wound.
- 420.0–434.0 s: Six completed running loops are visible; the next bite is being prepared with forceps eversion.
- 465.0–479.0 s: Six completed loops remain visible as another bite is passed and drawn through; tensioning ongoing.
- 525.0–554.0 s: The line is tensioned and managed near the superior end; six completed bites persist through these frames while progression is secured.
- 555.0–569.0 s: A superior bite is added and tightened; the count within these frames still shows six completed loops as the new pass is positioned.
- 570.0–584.0 s: Seven completed running throws are now visible along the superior half as the line is further tightened and set.
- 585.0–590.0 s (final state): Eight completed throws/bites are visible along the continuous line; no hands are present and the field is at rest.

Technique consistency and quality of closure
The continuous technique is applied consistently: needle orientation remains perpendicular, bite depths and offsets appear symmetric, and the loops cross the incision at regular intervals. The assistant uses pickups as needed for eversion during passage phases and relaxes that assistance during pure tensioning phases. In one segment, an instrument tie is employed mid‑run to stabilize the line as it advances; while not mandatory in all running closures, it is a reasonable maneuver to maintain even apposition and prevent loosening while the operator repositions. The line’s progression trends from the inferior portion toward the superior end, with the right hand predominantly controlling the driver and the left hand managing the loop and free limb. There are no signs of undue crush or gapping at the completed segments; eversion is modest but adequate for a silicone model. The lay of the suture is neat, and tail management is minimal because this is a continuous run rather than a series of interrupted knots.

Final state and mandatory suture count verification
By the end of the procedure, the right‑of‑center incision is closed with a continuous running line whose quality and spacing remain consistent from the lower portion to the superior end. The definitive last view (585.0–590.0 s) shows:

- The driver resting with the needle attached, no hands in the field.
- The wound edges well‑approximated along the right‑of‑center incision.
- Exactly eight completed running throws/bites visible along this continuous line.

Mandatory verification:
1) Total number of completed sutures/throws visible in the final frames: 8.
2) This count is explicitly confirmed from the final paused field at 585.0–590.0 s.
3) The final state shows a neat, continuous zig‑zag across the right‑of‑center incision with eight completed crossings, instruments resting off to the side.
4) Count progression during the case:
   - Start of the run: 0 completed (30.0–44.0 s).
   - Early/mid: 4 progressing to 5 completed (360.0–374.0 s; corroborated by the pause at 345.0–359.0 s showing five present).
   - Mid/late: 6 completed (420.0–434.0 s; 465.0–479.0 s; 525.0–554.0 s).
   - Late: 7 completed (570.0–584.0 s).
   - End: 8 completed (585.0–590.0 s).

In summary, the surgeon performs a continuous running closure on the right‑of‑center vertical incision, initiating the run with careful, perpendicular needle placement and progressing cranially with consistent bite spacing and tension control. The nondominant hand alternates between eversion with pickups and pure strand management, while the dominant hand maintains precise needle handling and occasional instrument‑assisted ties to secure progression. After sequential passes bring the count from zero to five, then to six, seven, and finally eight completed crossings, the procedure pauses with the needle parked on a driver and the wound edges evenly approximated. The procedure resulted in 8 completed sutures (running bites) on the right‑of‑center continuous line at the final state.
