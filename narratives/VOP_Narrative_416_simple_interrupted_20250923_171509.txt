COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone skin pad with multiple parallel practice incisions, but the operator’s attention stays directed to a single linear wound: the central vertical midline incision. Over the course of the session, that one line is methodically closed using standard, symmetric dermal bites with careful attention to eversion, alignment, and consistent spacing. The work proceeds from the lower portion upward, with intermittent pauses to secure knots and trim tails, culminating in a neatly approximated “ladder” of simple interrupted stitches toward the superior end.

The setup phase shows the instruments arranged and the operator settling into a steady, bimanual routine. A needle driver is loaded correctly with the curved needle grasped about one-third from the swaged end. Tissue forceps are brought into play with the nondominant hand to present the skin edges; scissors are laid off to the side and remain idle during the earliest maneuvers. The driver is oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin so the needle can follow its natural arc rather than being pushed straight through. Early on, the hands hover over the chosen vertical incision, confirming bite orientation and spacing. The forceps position just lateral to the intended entry point to facilitate slight edge eversion without crushing, and the driver hovers opposite, poised to start the first pass.

Initial suture passes are placed in the lower segment of the line. The driver delivers the needle into the near edge, perpendicular to the epidermal surface, with wrist rotation carrying it through the dermis, across the gap, and out the contralateral edge at a symmetric depth and distance from the margin. The nondominant hand’s forceps support the edges during entry and exit and then briefly catch the needle tip to pull it through before returning it for reloading. These first placements prioritize clean, matched bites and a gentle eversion of the wound margins. The strand is drawn through the tissues and tensioned sufficiently to bring edges together without blanching or strangulation. In these early passes, no knot is tied immediately; the surgeon focuses on establishing a rhythm and precise bite geometry as the closure advances upward.

As the sequence progresses along the lower third, the needle is repeatedly reloaded to maintain a perpendicular approach, with the forceps moving ahead of the driver to present each bite. The right-hand pickups lift the dermis just at the epidermal border to guide where the needle will engage, while the driver, often in the left hand at this stage, stays slightly to the left of midline and angles across to the right edge for the approach. After each bite is completed and the needle exits, the assistant hand either retrieves the needle to shorten the suture path or manages the strand to keep the field clear. The instrument choreography remains consistent: opposing hands straddling the incision, instruments parallel to the wound, with only brief crossing to complete needle transfers or to tighten a loop.

Near the lower end where a prior tail is present, a pass is completed and the slack is taken out to set up for securing. The edges lie neatly approximated, and the operator transitions into knot-tying for selected stitches. When tying, the needle typically remains parked in the driver or controlled on the long strand to prevent accidental drift. Instrument ties are performed: the driver and forceps alternate roles as posts and working tools to form square, flat throws. Wraps are placed in alternating directions, and each throw is gently slid down to the skin to seat the knot over the incision. Throughout, the forceps apply minimal, careful stabilization at the wound edge, ensuring alignment while the knot is cinched and without increasing tissue trauma. Once a knot is properly seated, attention returns to needle reloading and the next placement.

Working upward through the middle third, the routine remains consistent: load the needle at the proximal third, approach perpendicularly, take matched bites across the gap, and use the forceps to evert and guide. The operator demonstrates good needle-handling fundamentals, regripping as needed to preserve a perpendicular entry angle and to avoid torqueing or bending the needle. The suture is drawn through carefully, occasionally with the forceps gently controlling the short end to prevent entanglement. Where knots are tied during this segment, the throws are well controlled and at times multiple sequential loops are visible as a knot stack is built over a previously placed stitch. After securing, the needle is reloaded promptly, and the next target point is selected a few millimeters superior to the last, keeping spacing consistent and advancing the closure.

At one point mid-sequence, the view shows what appears to be a short transverse orientation while a knot is being formed; the technique, however, remains unchanged. The pad or camera orientation likely shifts, but the same midline wound is being worked. The needle is not driven in those frames; rather, the driver is used as a tying instrument to square the knot, with the forceps briefly stabilizing a wound edge and then transitioning to manage the short tail during throws. This pause allows consolidation of earlier passes: the edges remain closely approximated as the knot is seated, and the free strands are organized to prepare for continued bites above.

As the closure enters the central-to-upper third, there is a steady cadence of bite–pull-through–tie. The nondominant hand’s forceps become especially important near the superior segment, everting either edge just lateral to the incision and presenting the dermis for precisely placed entry and exit points. The operator often regrips the needle after a pass to keep it aligned for the subsequent bite. In frames where a second driver appears in the nondominant hand, it is used to assist with knot handling or to manipulate the suture ends during instrument ties, while the primary driver holds the needle or acts as the tying instrument. The scissors remain unused through much of this portion, then are introduced later for trimming tails once a series of knots are secured.

A brief interval shows strand management without new tissue penetration: previously placed stitches are tightened, positioned precisely on the skin surface, and the tails are trimmed sequentially. The left hand centers over the knots while the right hand, holding forceps or a second driver, works just lateral to the line to control the suture and accomplish neat trimming. This interlude reflects attention to housekeeping—clearing the field and standardizing knot stacks—before resuming placement near the top of the incision.

Returning to needle passage in the upper-mid segment, the surgeon takes additional bites with the same careful technique. The needle is grasped two-thirds from its tip, approaches perpendicular to the skin, and follows a smooth arc through each edge. The pickups maintain slight eversion without crushing, and the driver’s wrist rotation drives the needle reliably through the dermis to emerge at mirrored points. On pull-through, one hand stabilizes the emerging needle while the other manages the strand to prevent undue friction on the tissue. With each pass, the edges draw together with mild eversion, creating a uniform approximation consistent with interrupted skin closure. Instrument ties follow—alternating throws, tamped down with deliberate, even tension—then the tails are either cut or left temporarily until a trimming sequence.

In the topmost segment, the operator continues placing new stitches. The hands remain close to the midline, instruments parallel to the incision, and movements short and controlled. A stitch is set with bites that mirror the spacing of prior passes, the suture is drawn through and tensioned, and then tying begins. During the tying sequence at the superior end, both hands may hold needle drivers to execute instrument throws efficiently; one driver stabilizes the standing part, the other forms and advances the loop. Throws are alternated to square the knot, and the knot is snugged down precisely over the skin to maintain edge alignment without inversion. Scissors are then brought into the field to trim tails to an appropriate length.

Throughout, the spatial relationships of the hands and instruments are consistent and safe. The driver and forceps straddle the wound with tips aligned at the planned bite site. Movements are kept within a few millimeters of the incision to maintain control over depth and entry/exit symmetry. When crossing is necessary—for example, to receive the needle on the far side or to tighten a throw—the instruments cross briefly above the wound, then return to a parallel, opposed stance. The supporting hand stays just ahead of the driver, presenting the tissue edge, and then shifts across the incision as soon as the needle tip is visible to assist its emergence. The operator’s wrists rest on the pad or board to stabilize fine motions, especially during delicate eversion maneuvers and knot seating.

One short segment suggests a sequence of passes drawn through sequentially before tying, which can resemble a running setup; however, the remainder of the session demonstrates standard interrupted closure with discrete knots secured after individual passes. Where minor discrepancies appear in orientation or handling, the overarching pattern remains consistent: symmetric bites on opposing sides of the same vertical incision, followed by careful approximation and secure knot construction. The needle is consistently grasped at the appropriate point on its body, aligned perpendicular to the skin surface, and driven with wrist rotation rather than pushing, preserving the needle’s curvature and minimizing tissue trauma. The forceps are used judiciously to evert and stabilize, with attention to minimizing crush injury at the epithelial edge.

By the late stages, the superior portion of the wound receives its final stitches. New bites are placed and tightened, with one sequence showing knot tying completed at the top, and scissors brought in readiness to trim. Another brief set of frames shows preparation for a subsequent pass—needle loaded and positioned—though no new penetration is made within that short interval. The hands remain poised just left and right of the incision, the field organized, and the previously placed stitches seated evenly.

At the conclusion, the vertical midline incision is closed across its length with a neatly spaced series of interrupted sutures. The edges are well approximated with mild, uniform eversion and without undue tension. Knot stacks sit flat and centered over the line, and tails are trimmed to a tidy, consistent length along the completed lower and middle segments; the top knot is secured, with trimming either completed or imminent based on the final frames. The instruments are withdrawn from the wound, and the line presents as a clean, ladder-like closure that reflects careful attention to bite symmetry, perpendicular needle entry, and precise instrument ties. The overall impression is of a methodical, technically sound interrupted skin closure on a single vertical incision, progressing from the lower third upward, with intermittent knot securing and trimming, and finishing with secure approximation at the superior end.
