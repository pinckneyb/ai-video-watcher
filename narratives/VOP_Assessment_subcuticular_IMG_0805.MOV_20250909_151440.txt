Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
You demonstrate solid fundamentals in needle control, symmetric bite placement, and gentle tissue handling. The corridor is kept clean, the needle is consistently driven on its curve, and knot sequences are deliberate and secure. These are essential foundations and they show you can execute precise, atraumatic work. However, the subcuticular objective is not met. Instead of maintaining a continuous intradermal track just deep to the epidermis, you repeatedly traverse the epidermis at inferior, mid, and superior segments and leave knots on the surface. For a true subcuticular closure, every pass must remain within the dermis with the needle tip traveling parallel to the skin, entries 2–3 mm from the edge, bites 3–5 mm in length, and zero surface punctures along the run. Start with a buried dermal anchor (or lateralized tail), advance entirely intradermally with consistent depth, then terminate with a buried knot (or Aberdeen finish) off-line from the incision. On your next attempt: deliberately set the plane by tenting the dermis and skiving the needle just under the epidermis; watch the needle tip stay intradermal at all times; adjust bite length and depth to keep the surface flat without ridging; and ensure both start and finish are buried/lateralized. I expect a continuous intradermal run with no epidermal breaches and a flat, well-approximated line end to end.
