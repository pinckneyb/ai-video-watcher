COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a quiet field: a synthetic skin pad mounted on a wooden base, three parallel vertical incisions running top to bottom. For an extended initial stretch, there are no hands and no instruments. The camera lingers on the surface, often centered over the middle slit. That midline cut shows faint puncture marks at its midpoint as if it had been used for demonstration or prior practice, but in these early moments nothing is manipulated. The pad remains motionless; the wound edges across all three incisions are slightly gaped and undisturbed, with no eversion, traction, or suture material visible. This unhurried setup sequence continues through multiple intervals: the lens revisits the central incision repeatedly, but there is no contact—no driver, no forceps, no needle. Even when a gloved hand briefly comes into frame above the pad, it does not engage tissue. It’s an extended prelude of observation, likely finalizing position, lighting, and mental choreography before beginning the actual closure.

When the work begins, it does so decisively on the vertical incision closest to the right edge of the pad, not the midline. The operator brings a needle driver into the frame, complemented by tissue forceps in the opposite hand. The first maneuver shows careful setup on the right wound edge of the right-side incision: the forceps lift and lightly evert the dermal margin, presenting a reliable entry point while protecting the epidermal tip from crush. The needle, clamped at the proximal-to-mid third of its curve, is oriented perpendicular to the pad. With a pronation-supination motion, the tip is directed into the right wound lip just inferior to the incision’s midpoint. The driver angle is adjusted to keep the arc perpendicular to the skin surface as it advances. The left hand’s forceps, placed just lateral to the entry site, shepherd the tissue during penetration and help shape gentle eversion. The needle passes through dermis, emerges into the wound gap, and is regrasped nearer the tip to continue and complete the arc across to the opposite side. The suture is drawn through, leaving an appropriate tail to be tied later. It is the first true engagement with tissue in the entire video and establishes the pattern that follows: deliberate perpendicular bites, attention to dermal purchase, and staged regrips to keep the needle’s curvature working for the operator rather than against them.

The next frames extend this first stitch across the gap. The driver crosses the incision line perpendicularly for the exit on the left wound edge, again with the needle controlled at the proximal third, arc forward. There’s a regrip at the tip during emergence, a measured pull-through, and the suture is advanced across. At this early stage, tissue handling is conservative: the forceps provide stabilization on entry but are not aggressively raking or deforming the edges. There is no knot tying yet; instead, the sequence emphasizes placement and controlled pull-through, ensuring the thread glides without snagging and leaves a tail of sensible length.

Completion follows shortly. With the suture spanning the wound, the needle is either parked or controlled as the driver hand transitions to tying. The knot is set on the epidermal surface, and instrument ties are used to cinch it flat without crushing tissue. The tails are dressed in place on the right side of the wound, consistent with a neat, standardized orientation. Scissors then appear to trim the ends. This first stitch is secured near the lower third of the incision, where the initial approximation is visible and the edges start to coapt neatly. The approach is methodical: tie, dress, cut—then immediately redeploy for the next bite just superior to the prior knot.

The next sequence shows preparation for another interrupted stitch just above the first. The driver hovers over the same right-side incision, while the assisting hand returns with forceps to the near/right edge. The forceps again pinch and slightly evert the dermal edge to present the tissue, staying just off the very edge to preserve tissue integrity. The driver maintains a perpendicular approach, inserting the needle at a consistent offset from the margin. As before, the needle is regripped during passage so the curved path is controlled and the needle emerges cleanly. The suture then traverses the wound in an even arc. Between these passes, tension on the suture is used to help align the edges without over-tightening, and the assistant manages the slack so the field remains visible.

What follows is a cadence that repeats and matures as the closure moves upward along this same right-side incision: stitch placement, pull-through, tying, trimming, then a new setup slightly superior. In some intervals the needle is parked and the driver is used primarily as the tying instrument; in others, the operator transitions quickly from placement to knotting without setting the needle aside. Several sequences focus wholly on knot security and dressing of the knot stack—tightening, flattening, and cutting tails—without any new needle passages. The knot stacks sit consistently on the right side of the incision, and the edges are drawn together with measured tension to avoid blanched ischemic bites or dog-ears. The assistant’s role alternates between tissue forceps to support eversion during entry and scissors to trim after the ties are thrown. Early on, there are moments where more of the approximation comes from suture traction rather than overt tissue manipulation with forceps; later, the forceps are used more consistently to lift the dermal edge and standardize eversion and bite depth.

Mid-procedure, the hand that holds the needle driver occasionally switches. In some runs, the left hand holds the driver and works centrally over the wound while the right hand takes up the forceps at the lateral/right edge; at other times, the driver is in the right hand with the left assisting. This hand-switching appears purposeful: it preserves a perpendicular entry angle and comfortable wrist motion as the work advances proximally. The spatial relationship of instruments remains disciplined. The driver usually occupies a superior-central position relative to the bite site, while the forceps approach from the patient’s right to stabilize the near edge or catch the emerging needle. The instruments triangulate over the incision, straddling the cut with a clear line of sight to the needle tip at all times. The suture lay is controlled, often arcing away from the field to prevent entanglement, and the long strand is kept lateral while tying to avoid draping across the wound.

As additional stitches accumulate in the lower third, the edges become progressively approximated. A small cluster of knot stacks is visible where the first few stitches were secured. Above this, the operator initiates the next pass, careful to maintain consistent spacing and depth relative to the previous bites. In one segment, only the suture is manipulated and tensioned while the needle is reloaded and parked, suggesting a focus on dressing the recently placed stitch before moving on. Another segment shows active knot construction over a previously placed stitch; the driver grasps the long strand and uses it to form loops for instrument ties while the other hand maintains control of the short tail, then the knots are snugged down, flattened, and cut.

Advancing through the middle of the incision, the operator resumes the pattern: position, evert with forceps, drive the needle perpendicular from the near/right side across to the far/left side, regrip near the tip, and complete the curve. The suture is pulled through cleanly, leaving a tail of suitable length. Knot tying sequences recur, often without a forceps in view during the tie; then the scissors enter briefly to trim. There are short pauses where only a hand rests on the pad near the wound, likely to stabilize the model or tension the suture line prior to the next bite, without any new tissue penetration.

As the closure moves into the mid–upper segment of the wound, the technique remains consistent and the ergonomics adapt to the changing angle: the driver stays centered above the target bite point and the assisting hand approaches laterally to evert the right edge, then crosses over as needed to assist retrieval on the far side. Each new stitch is placed just proximal to the last, and the bite widths mirror each other across the incision to maintain symmetry. The suture line advances in an orderly fashion, with the edges coming together evenly. The model’s synthetic skin allows for predictable needle passage and tidy knot seating; the operator takes advantage of that to keep the knot stacks compact and aligned along the right margin.

One brief interval shows instruments hovering over another area of the pad—including a long horizontal cut across mid-pad—but there is no sustained engagement and no stitch placement on that line. The activity promptly returns to the same right-side vertical incision where the work continues. That moment reads as a transient repositioning or camera pan rather than a change in target; the closure remains fully committed to the single vertical wound on the right throughout.

Approaching the superior end of the incision, the pattern persists: establish perpendicular entry, use the forceps to lift and evert the edge, take a symmetric bite across the gap, regrip and deliver the needle through the far side, and draw the suture across. The knot is then secured with instrument ties and the tails trimmed short. In the highest segment, the driver often approaches from a slightly more superior angle to preserve a clean perpendicular path as the working room narrows near the top of the cut. The assistant manages the last few tails, stabilizing knots during trimming to avoid loosening.

The final sequences are devoted to finishing touches at the top of the incision. The newest stitch is adjusted and its knot tightened, with careful dressing of the lay. The scissors return to clip the tails to a tidy length. There is a short interval where the driver holds the suture near the newest knot, setting the tension and position, while the assistant steadies the area. No new needle passages occur during this finalization; the emphasis is on secure knot seating and a neat appearance.

Across the entire procedure, the closure technique stays true to a classic interrupted approach along a single vertical wound. Needle entry is consistently near 90 degrees to the skin, with the curve used as intended and regrasped near the tip to complete passages without dragging. Tissue handling is gentle: forceps grasp the dermal margin rather than the epidermal tip, and eversion is encouraged without excessive torque. Bite placement appears balanced across the incision with small, even margins. Knot tying is methodical, using instrument ties to secure each stitch before moving to the next. Periods of knot management and tail trimming punctuate the sequence of passes, maintaining an efficient rhythm. The driver occasionally changes hands to optimize the working angle, but the relationship of instruments to the wound—driver central over the line, forceps lateral for edge control—remains consistent. Suture strands are managed to keep the field clear, often directed laterally away from the wound during tying and then laid neatly over the knot before trimming.

There are stretches at the start when the field is static and no manipulation occurs, and a later momentary wander of instruments near a different cut, but these do not alter the course of the procedure. The actual closure begins on the right-side vertical incision and stays there from the first bite through final trimming. The wound is addressed sequentially from its lower portion upward toward the superior end, with each stitch independently placed and secured before the next begins. Early stitches show minimal direct tissue eversion at times, relying more on suture tension for approximation; as the sequence progresses, forceps use becomes more consistent for eversion and stabilization at entry. Throughout, the operator maintains an unobstructed view of the needle tip and adapts hand positions to preserve perpendicular entry and smooth arcs.

By the end, the right-most vertical incision is neatly closed. A series of interrupted stitches spans from the lower third where the first knot cluster sits up to the top edge of the wound. The edges are approximated with subtle eversion and without visible gapping. Knot stacks are compact and lie along the right side, their tails trimmed short. The central and left vertical cuts remain untouched. The closure reads as a disciplined, stepwise build—place, tie, trim—repeated with consistent technique until the wound is fully coapted. The final state shows a secure, evenly spaced line of stitches with well-aligned edges and cleanly dressed knots, reflecting a controlled execution from initiation through completion.
