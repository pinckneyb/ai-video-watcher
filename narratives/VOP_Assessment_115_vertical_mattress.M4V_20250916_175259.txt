Pattern: Vertical Mattress

Summative assessment:
Final construct shows eight completed stitches with neat, mostly even spacing and gentle handling. Needle control is generally perpendicular, and tensioning maintains acceptable approximation without gapping. These are foundational strengths. However, vertical mattress fundamentals are lacking. The characteristic far‑far deep pass followed by a near‑near superficial pass is not executed, resulting in inadequate eversion and suboptimal tension distribution for this pattern. Security is a major deficiency: the line is not clearly anchored with square knots at the start and end. To meet vertical mattress standards, execute deliberate far bites (approximately 5–8 mm from the edge) followed by near bites (1–3 mm), maintain perpendicular needle travel through each layer, achieve visible eversion along the length, and secure the construct with proper square knots. Streamline instrument changes and minimize extra tensioning steps to improve efficiency.
