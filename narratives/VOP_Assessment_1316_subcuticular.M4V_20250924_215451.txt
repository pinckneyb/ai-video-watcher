COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the operator focused on the central vertical skin incision located in the middle column of the practice pad. From the first frames through the final sequence, all activity is concentrated on that single linear wound; the adjacent parallel incisions are left untouched. The wound is a full‑thickness linear slit approximately 2–4 cm in length depending on the moment in the sequence, and the work proceeds sequentially along its length, from one end toward the other, placing and securing suture bites until the entire length is approximated and secured.

Early in the recording the operator establishes controlled access and visualization of the wound margins. The assistant (or nondominant hand) commonly uses fine toothed forceps/Adson-style pickups to grasp and evert one edge while the dominant hand positions and advances a small curved needle held in a needle driver. The tweezer grips tend to be atraumatic but firm enough to evert epidermis and expose dermal tissue for a precise bite. Throughout, tissue handling is deliberate and conservative — synthetic dermis and subcutaneous layers are engaged in superficial-to-mid dermal bites rather than any deep buried layer work. There is consistent attention to slight eversion of the skin edges at the bite site to promote good epidermal approximation once the knot is secured.

Needle management is highly consistent: the curved needle is repeatedly grasped in the jaws of a ringed needle driver, usually toward the mid‑shaft or slightly proximal to the point. This grip provides rotational control of the curvature and allows the surgeon to advance the needle in a controlled arc across the wound margin. In many passes the instrument approaches from the left side of the frame while tissue forceps approach from the right (or vice versa), creating an opposing, coordinated motion where one instrument drives the needle and the other provides counter traction and retrieval. Occasionally the operator grasps the needle closer to the swaged end when initial penetration or withdrawal demands greater control. When the needle has been passed, the suture strand is drawn through the tissues and the trailing tail is managed with either a hemostat/long clamp or fingertip control depending on the moment in the case.

The sequence unfolds as a series of discrete bites placed along the midline incision. In the earliest passings the wound margins are slightly open and the surgeon takes measured, full‑thickness to superficial dermal bites near the wound edge to begin reapproximation. Hands remain close to the wound throughout — average separation between instruments and fingers is consistently around 1–3 cm — enabling fine motor control. The operator alternates which side approaches with the needle driver; frequently the left hand provides needle control while the right stabilizes tissue and gathers suture tails, but this laterality is not rigid and instruments are switched or repositioned as necessary.

Between about 15–90 seconds into the recording the operator delivers a series of foundational stitches through the central portion of the incision. Each pass follows a reproducible pattern: the needle driver brings the curved needle in a short arc through one lip, the opposing forceps everts and stabilizes the opposite lip, the needle exits, and the suture is pulled through to form a loop across the wound. The suture limbs are then managed — either by clamping the tail with a hemostat or by holding it with a fingertip — so that the knot‑tying sequence can proceed. During these early bites the surgeon uses short, controlled needle arcs and maintains bites relatively close to the wound margin to optimize edge apposition, a technique that preserves dermal support and minimizes gapping.

As the session continues the operator works both inferior and superior extents of the same vertical line. Frames at 60–180 seconds show repeated needle passes at the inferior end, while later frames around 240–330 seconds display activity concentrated toward the superior end. This progression indicates a methodical approach: the surgeon places a stitch, secures and tightens it, then advances to the next adjacent interval and repeats the pass. Instrument positioning follows this linear progression — hands migrate subtly along the length of the incision, maintaining their opposing relationships (needle driver on one side, forceps on the other) as the work advances. At times the two instruments approach at oblique shallow angles to one another to facilitate the bite orientation; other times the driver is nearly perpendicular to the wound, particularly when withdrawing the needle through an exiting margin.

There are frequent variations in the way the suture tails are handled depending on the moment. Early and mid‑case frames show the operator frequently using fingertips to tension and orient suture limbs, particularly when knot tying preparation requires rapid adjustments. At other times a hemostat or ratcheted needle driver is used to grasp and control the free limb while the other hand forms throws. This mix of manual fingertip control and instrument assistance gives the operator nimble control during knot formation and allows quick alternation between passing and tying.

Tissue interaction remains gentle and focused on approximation rather than wide retraction. Forceps elevate and evert the epidermal margin, and the needle is passed through dermis with minimal tissue trauma. The synthetic pad shows no evidence of deep undermining or extensive subcutaneous control; the surgeon consistently takes bites of appropriate depth to oppose dermal layers and achieve slight eversion for optimal wound edge healing. Where minor trailing of the suture across the pad is visible, the operator immediately manages it by routing or clamping the limb to avoid entanglement during subsequent passes.

Around the middle portion of the recording there is a brief divergence in descriptive notes describing a continuous/serial advancement of suture down the wound; however, the observed pattern elsewhere remains consistent with sequential, discrete passes followed by knot management and tightening. Where this description conflicts with the rest of the visual evidence, the surgeon nonetheless continues advancing and securing stitches along the same vertical line in a stepwise fashion. The practical effect is an orderly series of approximation bites progressing along the wound, each being tensioned and secured before the next adjacent bite is completed — an approach that maintains consistent closure quality and predictable edge apposition.

Over time the technique matures in subtle ways. Initially the operator relies more on instrument‑to‑instrument coordination — needle driver versus forceps — to place and retrieve the needle. Later, particularly in the superior segments, the operator increasingly employs fingertip manipulation of suture tails and direct manual approximation to refine eversion and edge contact before tying. Knot‑tying sequences also appear to become more streamlined: the surgeon alternates between instrument‑tied throws using the needle driver and free‑hand tensioning of the opposing limb, then secures throws with a clamped instrument when needed to maintain tension while creating subsequent throws. This hybrid approach (instrument throws interlaced with manual tensioning) allows efficient conversion from needle passage to a secure knot while minimizing suture slack.

Spatially, the hands and instruments maintain a tight working relationship around each bite. The needle driver and forceps repeatedly converge over the same small zone of tissue; when one instrument approaches from the left the other compensates from the right, creating a nearly opposing dynamic that centers on the wound apex. As the suturing advances cranially, this oppositional engagement moves along the incision accordingly. When securing a knot, the operator often crosses instruments above the incision to form throws, with the non‑tying hand providing countertraction or holding the suture tail laterally out of the field to prevent entanglement. During knot cutting the instruments briefly separate slightly but remain adjacent to the work site to allow immediate re‑approximation if necessary.

Throughout the sequence the surgeon appears mindful of minimizing bulk and spacing the bites evenly. The previously placed stitches are visible along the wound as the video progresses — a row of closely spaced, slightly everted bites that collectively produce a continuous, uniform approximation. The stitch intervals remain fairly consistent, and the operator tends to work adjacent to previously tied knots rather than skipping large gaps, resulting in a linear progression of secured stitches from one end of the incision to the other.

In the latter frames activity becomes dominated by finishing maneuvers: final tightening, knot docking, trimming of tails, and small adjustments to edge contact. At the superiormost interval the operator secures the final knot(s), using the needle driver to guide throws and a clamp or fingertip to control the free limb while the last throws are seated. Once knots are secure the surgeon trims suture tails with scissors or removes the needle and finalizes the last throw, leaving the line of interrupted bites in place.

The final state of the wound shows a neat, continuous row of closely spaced sutures along the vertical incision. Edges lie in close apposition with slight eversion at each bite — a common and intentional result to promote epidermal edge approximation. There is no evidence of undue gaping, and the stitches appear evenly tensioned. Free tails have been trimmed or laid against the pad; most instruments have been withdrawn from the immediate work zone by the last frames while the operator inspects and palpates the closure with gloved fingers to confirm hemostasis and approximation.

In summary, the procedure is a focused, methodical closure of a single central vertical incision on the practice pad, performed by alternating controlled needle passes with careful tissue traction and subsequent knot formation. Needle handling is consistent (curved needle grasped near mid‑shaft and rotated through tissue in short arcs), tissue manipulation is atraumatic and geared toward slight eversion and dermal approximation, and suture management alternates between instrument control and fingertip tensioning to expedite knot tying. Hands and instruments remain tightly coordinated and progressively migrate along the incision as each stitch is placed and secured; by the end a continuous, well‑approximated row of interrupted bites spans the wound, with final trimming and inspection completed to leave a stable closure. Where a brief descriptive inconsistency suggests a continuous serial approach, the observed workflow remains chiefly sequential and discrete in its passing and securing of stitches, producing a consistent, well‑organized final closure.
