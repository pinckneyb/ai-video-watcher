COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a static field showing the practice pad and multiple incision lines: a short superior incision and two centrally located vertical incisions already bearing a row of interrupted stitches. For the first several seconds there is no hand or instrument activity — the preplaced interrupted sutures along the top-center and midline wounds set the scene as reference points. Within the first half-minute the attention moves leftward and remains there for the remainder of the recording: the long vertical incision along the pad’s left third becomes the target for every active needle pass and suture manipulation that follows.

Early engagement (≈30–90 s)
At roughly 30 seconds the operator first addresses the left vertical slit (a 3–4 cm linear full‑thickness defect). The dominant hand appears either from the right or from above holding a needle driver (gold-handled or standard curved driver depending on the frame); the non‑dominant hand presents a fine toothed forceps (Adson‑style) to lift and evert the near lip. The needle is a curved swaged needle grasped consistently near the mid‑shaft/proximal third rather than at the tip, providing rotational control for a smooth arc. Passes are short and controlled: the needle approaches roughly perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin surface, enters about 2–3 mm from the wound margin, and is rotated through the dermal layer toward the opposing edge. Tissue handling is consistently atraumatic — forceps lift and tent the synthetic skin to present dermis, bites capture superficial dermis/subcutis, and the opposing edge is aligned for retrieval.

Technique pattern in these early passes is predominantly placement of isolated bites in a sequential manner: the suture material is pulled through, approximation achieved, and the operator withdraws to re‑position for the next bite. In many frames this appears as interrupted stitches placed from superior toward inferior, with instrument tips remaining within a few centimeters of each other across the wound (typically 1–4 cm). Crossed instrument trajectories are seen as the needle driver delivers the needle while the forceps provide counter‑traction.

Intermediate progression and hand coordination (≈90–240 s)
Between 90 and 240 seconds the operator continues methodical placement of stitches along the same left vertical incision. Hand positions remain tightly coordinated: one hand (usually the dominant) alternates between grasping the curved needle in the driver and repositioning it to enter at a fresh point, while the other hand stabilizes the adjacent tissue and manipulates the free suture tail when needed. The needle grip is consistently proximal to midshaft to maintain control of curvature; the trajectory is a controlled arc that transfixes tissue and exits the opposite margin close to the epidermal plane. Bites are generally taken fairly close to the wound edge to achieve dermal approximation with slight eversion, avoiding wide lateral bites or deep subcutaneous capture.

There are brief intervals where the stitch‑placement rhythm shows variations: in several clusters of frames the suture tail is long and the operator draws successive bites along the wound axis in a continuous manner, producing the visual impression of a running or continuous line being advanced. In other sequences the pattern clearly reverts to isolated passes resembling interrupted stitches — needle passage, pull‑through, withdraw, and then re‑engage for the next bite. These alternating impressions occur within the same line of work; numerically discrete knots are not always visible in real time, and in many frames knot tying or trimming is deferred off‑camera or outside the brief clip intervals. When ambiguity exists between continuous and interrupted technique, instrument and suture handling — the repeated re‑grasping of needle and repeated separate suture tail management — suggest the operator predominantly places sequential bites, securing them in turn.

Throughout this midphase the hands adapt their relative positions to the local segment of incision being addressed. When working superiorly the needle driver commonly enters from above or from the right/medial side, with the forceps held slightly inferolateral. As the work moves more inferiorly, the needle driver and forceps reposition accordingly — sometimes the driver approaches from the inferior/left and the forceps shift cranially to maintain opposition. The operator frequently rests fingers on the pad for stabilization while passing or pulling suture material, and instrument tips remain close to minimize torque and improve needle control.

Mid‑procedure pauses and incomplete visual information (≈240–360 s)
There are intermittent frames where hands and instruments leave the field. During these intervals the sutured line itself provides evidence of progression: fresh entry marks, short suture tails, newly approximated segments and slightly everted edges indicate recent needle activity. In several such intervals the absence of visible hands limits confirmation of exact grips or knot‑tying technique; the needle is at times not visible though its path is inferable from suture arcs. Despite these gaps, the sequence of newly appearing bites and the steady advance of closure along the left incision confirm continuous attention to the same line.

Later midphase — refinement and controlled bites (≈360–510 s)
Resumption of instrumented work shows continued attention to controlled, shallow bites. The non‑dominant forceps repeatedly evert the near edge and present the dermis, while the driver rotates the needle through the far edge and draws the suture through. Hands are closely opposed — frequently within 1–3 cm — and the pattern of approach is consistent: stabilize, bite, retrieve, tension. The operator avoids deep or traumatic passes through the pad, keeping sutures superficial and dermal, which results in slight eversion at stitch sites and a tidy line of apposition.

During several time blocks the operator uses a palmed grip on a gold‑handled driver, drawing the needle in a confident arc and feeding suture steadily. In some frames scissors or a hemostat are visible nearby, suggesting intermittent trimming or instrument exchange, but the core sequence remains placing additional stitches along the same left column rather than moving to other wounds.

Superior segment finishing and knot/tail management (≈510–660 s)
As the procedure progresses into the upper time segments the operator returns to the superior terminus of the left incision to place final bites and prepare for securing. The hand positions evolve slightly: one hand frequently assumes a position directly over the superior stitch holding the suture tail vertically, while the other hand approaches from the lateral side with a scissor or another instrument. In several frames the needle is not present, implying that the needle pass has been completed and the operator is managing the free ends to tie or trim. The superior area receives careful attention — the suture tail is lifted and kept away from the pad surface to facilitate knot tying and cutting.

Several final frames show small discrepancies in visibility — occasional frames with no hands — but subsequent frames document hand re‑entry to manipulate tails and organize the repaired line. The operator’s movements during this phase reflect finishing maneuvers: tensioning the last suture throws, aligning the dermal edges, and preparing to secure and trim. Handling remains measured and delicate; tissue is not over‑compressed and the slight eversion at stitch sites is maintained for epidermal alignment.

Pattern and technique development across the case
Across the entire recording the work on the left vertical incision demonstrates a clear evolution from initial exposure and first bites to methodical sequential closure and final suture management. The needle handling is consistent: a curved swaged needle is grasped near the midshaft, rotated in a controlled arc, and advanced perpendicular-to-oblique to take dermal bites. The non‑dominant hand consistently provides counter‑traction and eversion with fine toothed forceps or finger approximation. Spatially, the operator favors a tight working envelope — both instruments remain close to the wound (1–4 cm separation) to maximize precision and minimize needle wobble.

There are intervals where the pattern transiently resembles a continuous running line being fed along the wound, while in other intervals the mechanics reflect interrupted bites placed individually. Because knot tying and trimming are sometimes off‑camera and brief frames show long suture tails, the visual record cannot always confirm whether sequential bites were tied after each pass or whether multiple bites were placed followed by a series of knots. Notwithstanding that ambiguity, the practical effect on the closure is consistent: progressive reduction of the wound gap with dermal approximation and slight eversion.

Hand and instrument choreography
The choreography of hands and instruments is rhythmic and ergonomic. The dominant hand alternates between manipulating the needle and repositioning the driver; when a palmed grip is used the operator employs broad, stable motions to rotate the needle through tissue. The non‑dominant hand alternates between sharp, precise lifts with toothed forceps and fingertip approximation to maintain edge alignment. Instruments cross or sit parallel depending on the bite location, but remain coordinated in a compact working zone. When the superior end of the incision requires tying or trimming, one hand will hold the tail vertically while the other manipulates knots or scissors — a brief but deliberate shift from the earlier pass/retrieve cycle.

Final appearance and wound state
By the end of the recorded sequence the left vertical incision is consistently approximated along its length. Multiple closely spaced dermal bites have brought the edges into contact with subtle eversion at stitch sites; the line presents as tidy, with regular spacing and even tension. Several suture tails and knots are visible near the superior end, and frames indicate active handling of those tails consistent with final securing and trimming. There is no evidence of overt tissue puckering, tearing, or excessive inversion. The surrounding skin substitute is intact, and the repair mirrors standard dermal approximation technique emphasizing dermis‑to‑dermis contact and slight eversion to favor epidermal edge apposition.

Limitations and observations
Throughout the recording there are brief intervals without visible hands or instruments, and some needle passes occur partially off‑frame or with the needle not fully visible. These gaps limit confirmation of knot configuration and the precise timing of knot tying versus stitch placement. Additionally, occasional frames show characteristics associated with both interrupted and running techniques; these visual inconsistencies likely reflect short variations in workflow (e.g., placing several bites before tying versus tying each pass) rather than a wholesale change in approach. Despite these limitations, the narrative arc of the case is clear: methodical, controlled closure of the left vertical incision using a curved needle and opposing instrument/tissue control, progressing from initial bites to a completed, well‑approximated line ready for final securing and trimming.
