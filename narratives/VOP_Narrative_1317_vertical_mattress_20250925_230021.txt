COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a single, continuous repair of the same vertical skin incision on the synthetic training pad. The wound is a linear midline defect running roughly cranio‑caudal, located near the center of the pad, approximately 2–4 cm in length. Throughout the recording the operator works progressively along this same incision, placing a series of simple interrupted skin sutures to close the defect from one end toward the other. The narrative below follows the procedure chronologically, describing instrument use, needle handling, tissue interaction and knot work as the operator advances and completes the closure.

Initial approach and setup
At the outset the operator positions themselves over the pad with both hands gloved in green. A curved surgical needle mounted on a monofilament suture (black suture material visible) is loaded in a needle driver while a pair of fine tissue forceps (Adson‑style, toothed pickup) is held in the other hand. Instruments are introduced from opposing directions so their tips converge on the wound. The needle driver is usually positioned superior‑lateral to the incision while the forceps approach from inferior‑medial; hands are kept close together, typically 2–4 cm apart, creating a compact, fingertip‑scale working zone directly over the defect.

First bites and establishment of the interrupted pattern
The operator begins by taking shallow, full‑thickness dermal bites near the wound margin. The needle is consistently a curved geometry and is grasped at varying points along its body — depending on the maneuver — but most often at the distal third to midpoint of the curve to allow controlled rotation through tissue. Early passes show the driver approaching nearly perpendicular to the wound plane, driving the needle in a controlled arc through the dermal layer and emerging on the opposite side. The forceps lift and slightly evert the far edge for visualization and to assist needle reception. After the needle is withdrawn, the suture is drawn through and the assisting hand maintains counter‑tension to align edges, creating a slight eversion at the stitch site as the loop is tightened.

Technique detail: bite depth, edge handling and instrument interplay
Across the sequence the operator consistently takes superficial-to-mid‑dermal bites — the model’s synthetic dermis is penetrated with shallow arcs rather than deep fascial or buried passes. Tissue is handled atraumatically: forceps grasp are small and precise, used to evert and stabilize the epidermal edges without wide undermining. When approaching each bite the needle driver controls trajectory while the forceps provide countertraction lateral to the incision. The relative approach angle varies with location along the incision: sometimes the driver approaches from above at an oblique 30–45° angle, other times more perpendicularly from a superior or inferior direction; the common element is coordinated, opposing vectors between driver and forceps to produce controlled needle entry and exit.

Progression along the incision: repeated interrupted stitches
As the operator continues, interrupted sutures are placed sequentially along the same incision. The pattern is methodical: needle passes, suture retrieval, tensioning and formation of a knot, then trimming/arrangement of suture tails before the next bite. In some frames the operator completes knot throws immediately after a pass and trims the tail; in others the operator situates the suture loop and repositions instruments before final knot assembly. Multiple previously placed stitches are visible below (inferior to) the current working site at many points in the recording, demonstrating that closure is being executed progressively along the length of the wound — typically placing and securing stitches inferiorly and then moving superiorly to address unclosed tissue.

Needle grips and small technical variations
Needle grips vary based on task. For initial passes the driver usually holds the needle around the mid‑to‑distal shaft to permit full curvature-driven penetration. When advancing the needle for a controlled arc the grip is often at the mid‑shaft; when preparing to orient or make a finer maneuver, the driver moves closer to the swage/shaft junction. During knot formation the needle is sometimes held more proximally or exchanged for scissors/forceps to manipulate suture tails. Occasionally different instrument types are seen: straight needle holders, curved hemostats, or small clamps for counter‑traction are used transiently, but the predominant configuration remains a needle driver with an opposing toothed forceps.

Adaptations for variable wound segments
Throughout the sequence the operator adapts approach based on local topography of the incision. At the superior apex the operator frequently approaches from above/right, stabilizing the tissue with fingers or a clamp in the non‑dominant hand while passing the needle from the dominant hand. At more central or inferior sites the needle driver often approaches from a lateral or perpendicular orientation while the forceps receive and evert the opposing edge. In several frames the operator manages a small puncture or short slit adjacent to the main line — these are treated using the same interrupted technique, integrated as part of the continuous closure line rather than separate repairs, and are handled with shallower bites and close instrument proximity.

Knot formation and suture management
After each needle pass the free end is controlled by the non‑driving hand. Knot formation is performed with short, efficient throws; the assisting hand manipulates the tail while the needle driver performs the looping and tightening. The operator maintains slight eversion as stitches are tied to promote good edge apposition. Suture tails are trimmed periodically using a small cutting instrument or scissors; when trimming occurs it is typically after confirming secure knot configuration and satisfactory tissue approximation. The operator’s technique shows balance between speed and care — knot throws are secure but not excessively bulky, and suture tails are managed so they do not interfere with subsequent passes.

Hand position evolution over time
Hands remain consistently close to the incision for the entire procedure, rarely more than a few centimeters apart. Early in the sequence the non‑dominant hand sometimes rests on the pad before moving into a forceps grip to stabilize tissue; as the procedure progresses the assisting hand becomes more actively engaged in everted control and suture tail management. The dominant hand retains needle control throughout, but the approach angle and side of approach vary: at times the driver comes from the lateral side, at other moments it approaches from superior or inferior directions depending on which portion of the incision is being addressed. Instrument crossing over the wound axis is common as the operator repositions for optimal needle trajectory. The overall pattern is of two hands converging on a compact working zone, alternating roles of driving and tensioning smoothly.

Consistency of suturing technique
The suturing method remains a simple interrupted skin closure for the entire repair. There are no buried or deep layered closures performed; all bites are epidermal/dermal level on the synthetic model. The operator maintains consistent goals: take symmetric bites from margin to margin, achieve slight eversion at each knot, and maintain even spacing and tension between stitches. Small technical adjustments occur — changing grip point on the needle, altering insertion angle, or momentarily stabilizing the suture with fingertips — but these support the steady application of interrupted stitches. Overall, the technique shows a stable, practiced approach: reliable needle arcs, controlled tissue handling, and sequential knot security.

Spatial relationships and coordination
Throughout the procedure the needle driver and forceps remain in a tightly coordinated spatial relationship. The forceps typically sit lateral to the incision while the driver approaches from the opposite side; the non‑driving hand frequently applies upward lift to evert the margin while the driving hand advances the needle in a curvilinear motion. Hands and instruments operate within an approximately 1–6 cm workspace around the incision, most commonly within 1–3 cm of the suture site, allowing fine control during needle passage and knot tying. When working at the superior end, instruments approach from above and the assisting hand may be slightly distal to the driver; when working midline, an advertised "top vs bottom" orientation swaps accordingly. This fluid shifting maintains consistent tissue control and access to all parts of the incision.

Mid‑procedure observations: sequence reinforcement and efficiency
Midway through the recording the inferior half of the incision shows a row of secured interrupted sutures holding the closure together while attention shifts to the superior segment. The operator repeats the same fundamental sequence at each new site: evert and stabilize with forceps, grasp the curved needle in the driver (midshaft), pass through the near edge, traverse to the far edge, withdraw the needle, pull the suture through while the assistant hand maintains counter‑tension, fashion knot throws to achieve slight eversion, then trim or arrange tails. When multiple stitches are placed close together, the operator spaces them to maintain consistent approximation and to avoid tissue bunching. Several frames show momentary repositioning — exchanging instruments, adjusting grip location on the needle — but the rhythm of pass, tie, trim continues uninterrupted.

Final passes, finishing knots and trim
In the later frames the operator focuses on the most superior/apical portion of the incision, placing the last interrupted stitches to close the residual gap. Needle passes are completed, suture tails are tensioned and knotted, and final adjustments are made to ensure even edge approximation across the entire line. The operator cuts excess suture and smooths the knots to sit flush with the skin substitute. At the end of the sequence the wound is uniformly approximated along its length by a line of interrupted sutures. Slight eversion at individual stitch sites is visible, consistent with proper dermal approximation technique; there is no gross gaping, and the edges are aligned throughout.

Final appearance and operative impression
By the conclusion the incision is closed with multiple simple interrupted sutures spaced along the length of the former defect. Each stitch demonstrates shallow, dermal‑level bites with slight eversion and consistent tension. The operator has used a curved needle and monofilament suture throughout, holding the needle variably at midshaft or near the swage as task demands required. Instrument choreography remained efficient: the needle driver controlled needle trajectory; the Adson/ toothed forceps everted and stabilized; the non‑dominant hand managed tails and provided counter‑tension during knot tying. The final closure displays neat, evenly spaced interrupted knots and trimmed tails; the wound edges are well approximated without excessive tissue strangulation or puckering beyond slight, expected eversion. The entire repair sequence reflects a systematic, repeatable interrupted suturing technique applied consistently from one end of the incision to the other, concluding with a secure and cosmetically acceptable closure on the synthetic model.
