COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a focused, methodical repair of the single right-hand vertical slit on the practice pad. From the first frame through the end of the recording, the working field is dominated by that rightmost incision: the operator consistently positions instruments and suture activity around that slit and advances closure in a stepwise, interrupted fashion from the lower third toward the superior margin. (A few brief frames show activity on neighboring cuts — notably a tying sequence over the central slit in one early clip — and there are intermittent moments when instruments rest away from the pad. These occurrences are outliers to the continuous pattern of work on the right-hand slit and are noted as minor inconsistencies in an otherwise single-line procedure.)

Initial set-up and first passes
At the outset the operator establishes a conventional two-instrument arrangement: a needle driver approaches from the operator’s left/medial side while Adson-style tissue forceps are placed at the wound margin on the right. The curved, swaged needle is repeatedly grasped at various positions along its body (most commonly at the proximal third or roughly two-thirds from the tip, occasionally mid-shaft or toward the distal third) in order to optimize control of the arc for perpendicular, dermal-to-dermal bites. The needle is oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface for each intended bite; it is presented tangentially just before entry and then driven in a smooth arc that follows the curvature of the needle through the dermis/subdermal plane.

Throughout the lower third of the incision the sequence is highly consistent. The right-hand forceps lift and evert the near wound edge to present a crisp bite line, while the left-hand driver advances the needle through the far (right) edge and across to the opposing lip. Bites are shallow-to-moderate depth, placed a few millimeters from the epidermal margin to capture dermis adequately without excessive compression. The needle path is deliberate and controlled: tip alignment, wrist rotation, and maintenance of curvature are obvious priorities. After passage, the suture strand is drawn through and laid across the wound as the operator repositions to prepare each tie or subsequent bite.

Progression along the line and pattern development
Following the initial bite preparations, the operator proceeds along the slit in a linear, interrupted pattern — placing a stitch, drawing the suture through, tensioning, tying and trimming, then moving a short distance parallel to the axis of the incision to prepare the next bite. The work advances from lower toward midline and then to the superior portion of the slit over the course of the video. At various moments the operator pauses between bites: instruments may be withdrawn slightly, the needle driver rests on the table, or both hands leave the immediate wound area while the previously placed sutures remain in place and the wound edges relax. These pauses are interspersed with concentrated bursts of action in which the surgeon reloads the needle, aligns tissue edges, takes the next bite, pulls the suture through, and completes the knot-tying sequence.

Knot-tying and suture management
Knotting is performed primarily with the needle driver (instrument ties) while the contralateral hand provides counter-tension on the free tail of the suture. The operator alternates depending on the frame: sometimes the left hand controls the driver to form instrument ties while the right hand holds forceps or, later, simply pulls on the free end; in other moments the sides are reversed. Knot throws are sequentially seated to approximate the edges with slight eversion. After adequately tightening the knot, scissors are brought in briefly from the operator’s left in some clips to trim excess suture, leaving short tails. In certain clips the operator uses finger grasp to tension and align while forming knots, and in a few frames a needle is “parked” in the driver while tying down the suture — reflecting real-time, practical variation in knot technique while remaining within the selected technique framework.

Hand position evolution and instrument choreography
From the opening frames the typical choreography is for the needle driver to operate from the left-of-field and to deliver the needle across the incision while the forceps from the right-of-field evert and stabilize the near edge. This creates a working corridor directly over the slit with instruments opposing each other across the wound. As the case progresses the hands maintain this oppositional relationship, but small evolutions occur: the needle is sometimes grasped more proximally or distally on its curve to favor access to different points of the slit; the forceps occasionally yield to a second driver or to scissors for suture management; and at times the operator repositions to approach bites at slightly different angles (for example, obliquely at the superior end versus more orthogonally at the lower end) to accommodate the pad geometry and previously placed stitches.

There are brief segments in which the operator’s right hand removes or releases the forceps and either manages the free suture end by hand or brings in scissors to trim. On occasion both hands come together centrally for instrument ties, and at other times the non-dominant hand supports the pad or stays off-frame as a single hand pulls the suture while the other arranges the needle. A handful of clips show the needle driver and another instrument resting several centimeters away from the pad, indicating deliberate pauses in stitching. Later in the timeline, particularly when working the superior portion of the slit, slight lateral separation of the hands is used during knot preparation so tension can be created and then released to seat each throw.

Needle and tissue handling detail
Needle handling is consistently attentive to maintaining the natural curve during passage, with the operator re-grasping at different shaft positions to regain purchase and orientation after partial passes or to spin the needle for the optimal exit point. Entry and exit are generally through dermal layers — partial-thickness to moderate-depth bites — designed to achieve edge apposition and slight eversion rather than deep tissue puckering. The forceps’ grip is delicate, lifting mainly skin and superficial dermis to avoid crushing; when the operator needs precise alignment the forceps are used to adjust the opposing margin just prior to exit of the needle tip.

Spatial relationships and ergonomics
Spatially, the instruments consistently straddle the slit: the needle driver approaches from the medial/left side and traverses across the incision to the lateral/right edge where the forceps present the tissue. Hands remain close to the wound axis to minimize long instrument arcs and preserve control. The suture strand is frequently draped across the pad anteriorly; the free tail is managed by the hand that is not tying, pulled out of the field to avoid entanglement, and then used for instrument tie or finger tie. When trimming is performed, the scissors approach from the left side of the pad and cut the tails short after knot seating. At times a hemostat or other instrument rests idle at the lower-left of the field, and at least once the driver and another instrument sit a few centimeters from the pad while the operator pauses — demonstrating reasonable instrument housekeeping.

Pauses, irregularities, and isolated deviations
The overall pattern is consistent, but there are occasional brief deviations. One early clip documents knotting activity on the central slit; this is inconsistent with the predominant timeline but appears brief and isolated. Other frames show moments when no hands are present over the leftmost slit (idle, partially closed), or when the operator uses bare fingertips to press the slit edges together while tensioning a stitch rather than forceps. In several sequences the needle is re-grasped at different locations along its shaft, and in some frames a second instrument briefly substitutes for forceps. These variations are pragmatic adjustments rather than fundamental technique changes.

Advancing toward completion
As the recording advances, stitches are placed progressively higher on the slit. Midline segments show several stitches already seated and trimmed, with the operator continuing superiorly to close remaining gaps. The suture thread is repeatedly drawn across the skin, passed through both edges, tightened to approximate and evert, tied with instrument throws and then trimmed. At certain points the operator pauses to view the line and confirm alignment before proceeding. Near the end of the sequence, hands occasionally work from slightly different orientations to access the superior-most portion of the slit, but the same principles — perpendicular needle approach, dermal bites, eversion with forceps, instrument ties — are applied.

Final state
By the last frames the right-side slit appears largely approximated along the region where the operator has worked: previously gaping edges are held together by a succession of interrupted sutures, knot throws are seated with short tails, and most of the line shows slight eversion consistent with good dermal apposition. The leftmost incision remains sutured from earlier practice and the central slit is essentially untouched except for the brief tying excursion noted earlier. Instruments are withdrawn or resting and, in one later clip, the left wound is left partially closed while instruments lie idle — indicating that active stitching at the right slit has been completed or paused for final assessment. There are small residual gaps at the very proximal and distal ends of the pad in some clips, reflecting segments that were either left intentionally or were to be addressed outside of the current recording interval.

In summary, the operator executes a deliberate, instrument-driven interrupted closure of the rightmost vertical slit: delivering perpendicular, arc-following needle passes through dermis/subdermis; using forceps to evert and present margins; drawing the suture through, securing with instrument ties and trimming; and progressing incrementally from the lower toward the upper portions of the slit. Hand positions consistently oppose each other across the incision with occasional, practical shifts in which instrument performs which role. Minor deviations and brief off-line activity are present but do not change the principal pattern: a controlled, stepwise interrupted-suture repair producing approximated, slightly everted skin edges with seated knots and trimmed tails along the primary right-hand incision.
