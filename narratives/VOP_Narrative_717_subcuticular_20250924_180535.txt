COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with multiple parallel and oblique incisions in view, but the operator’s attention consolidates on a single linear wound on the left side of the field—a straight vertical slit just left of center that runs several centimeters from the lower part of the pad toward the top. The closure is executed with a simple interrupted skin suturing technique, progressing methodically from the inferior portion of the line upward, with careful instrument handling, edge eversion, and consistent, perpendicular needle drives that follow the needle’s natural arc. Other incisions are visible and occasionally referenced by camera angle or hand movement, but they remain background landmarks while the surgeon advances closure along this one line.

The first movements are at the lower extent of the wound where the slit is shorter and nearer the inferior border of the pad. The right hand controls the needle driver while the left hand uses tissue forceps to stabilize the near (inferior-lateral) edge. The needle is mounted correctly about a third of the way from the tip, with the curve and driver oriented at right angles to the skin so that entry is perpendicular. The left forceps lift the near margin to generate a slight eversion and a clean, dermal purchase a few millimeters from the cut edge. The needle is driven across the gap toward the opposing side’s dermis, following the arc with controlled wrist rotation and maintaining the driver-to-needle geometry throughout. In these opening frames, the priority is establishing an accurate bite at the inferior end of the line without crowding the corner. The suture strand arcs smoothly across the gap; tying is deferred while the first pass is completed and the thread is managed to maintain a clear field.

From this inferior position, attention settles on the apex-like corner where the wound approaches the lower border at a slight obliquity relative to the pad edges. The left forceps control that delicate corner to prevent tearing, and the right-hand driver adopts a perpendicular approach for a symmetric bite that respects the apex. The needle is advanced across, then regripped to complete the pass through the opposite lip. The strand is drawn through, and the operator transitions to an instrument tie. The long limb is oriented consistently away from the wound to square the throws. Using a driver and the forceps as needed, the surgeon cinches the knot down directly over the incision, seating it without strangulation. Excess tension is avoided; the edges lay flat with a slight eversion. Scissors come in briefly and cleanly trim the tails, marking a clean, controlled start at the inferior pole.

Building upward, the driver and forceps now oppose each other over the same line, this time at the central portion of the vertical slit that remains gaping. The right hand continues to carry the driver, while the left hand uses the Adsons to help present whichever edge is the current target for entry. The needle remains correctly loaded at its proximal third and is oriented perpendicular to the skin for each pass. The left instrument steadies and everts the near lip for accurate entry, while the right-hand driver follows the curvature of the needle through the dermis, angling the tip so it can be captured at the far edge with the forceps. The hand choreography stays tight to the wound edges; instruments straddle the incision and converge over the bite site so that both depth and distance from the edge are symmetric. Loops are managed with care to avoid crossing over adjacent, unused slits on the pad. As the needle emerges, it is transferred safely to the forceps and regripped to keep the arc orientation correct for the counterbite. Each time the suture is drawn through, slack is removed without dragging the skin, and the strand is kept out of the working triangle.

The next stitches repeat this pattern in a consistent, textbook fashion. At the lower-left portion of the same vertical line, the left hand now adopts the needle driver while the right hand handles the forceps—an ambidextrous adjustment for access and ergonomics. The essential components remain unchanged: the needle is grasped around the proximal-to-mid third, the entry is perpendicular, the bite width and depth are matched on both sides, and the dermal tissue is lifted just enough to evert without crushing. With each pass, the operator pulls the suture through, forming a loop that is then secured with instrument ties. Occasionally, two drivers are used during tying, one in each hand, to facilitate consistent, square throws; at other times, a driver and forceps combination suffices. When the knot is seated, it is positioned precisely over the incision line. The suture limbs are oriented deliberately—long limb lateral or inferior, short limb controlled—to minimize twisting and maintain a tidy, reproducible knot stack. Where a tie is shown, it is snugged down in the coronal plane, keeping the knot centered and the edges well approximated; where only a pass is shown, the strand is tensioned and laid out of the field, ready for the next throw.

As the closure advances into the mid-height of the left vertical slit, the same attention to detail is visible. The driver follows the arc cleanly; the forceps lightly grasp the dermis rather than the epidermal surface; and the needle is reloaded whenever needed to preserve an optimal trajectory for the counterbite. The surgeon demonstrates sound suture handling: the tail is kept free, the loop is controlled, and the long limb is used strategically to guide the knot into place. The camera angle shifts subtly across these sequences, and at times the line appears nearly midline in the frame; even so, the work remains on the same left-sided incision, and the method does not deviate.

There is a deliberate cadence to the progression: a pass is taken, the needle is retrieved and reloaded, the suture is drawn through and organized, then instrument ties are thrown to secure the stitch before moving cephalad. At the lower-center segment of the line, one pass is drawn completely from left to right, with the right-hand forceps capturing the emerging needle tip to protect the tissue and ensure a smooth exit. The suture is pulled through in a controlled manner, and while a knot is not tied in that particular moment, subsequent frames show the tie being set at adjacent positions along the same line, confirming the interrupted pattern. This rhythm continues into the superior half of the incision. The edges already show several well-placed stitches inferiorly; new work concentrates at the upper third. Here, reloading and suture organization are more prominent, reflecting the need to set up cleanly for the final passes as the available working space narrows near the superior endpoint.

As the operator reaches the superior-mid portion of the slit, an entire stitch sequence is completed: the dermal bites are taken symmetrically, the suture is drawn through, and sequential instrument ties are executed. Eversion is maintained as the throws are cinched, and the knot sits neatly over the line without lateral drift. The free needle is sometimes “parked” while the tying is performed—visible when the needle is held in the driver but not actively used—highlighting a safe approach to avoiding inadvertent sticks or soft-tissue trauma. In another nearby sequence just superior to an earlier knot, the surgeon repeats the cycle: drive, retrieve, draw through, then tie. The pattern remains consistent and conservative, with calm changes of hand dominance depending on access: sometimes the left hand drives the needle from lateral to medial; other times the right hand takes over to optimize the angle relative to the wound edge. In all cases, the needle tip meets the skin at a right angle, follows its curve, and exits in the dermis opposite the entry point at a mirror distance from the cut edge.

Occasionally, the camera shows moments where the instruments hover directly over the wound as the operator repositions the needle in the jaws—especially when working at the superior portion of the line. In those frames, the forceps approach only briefly to suggest an intended grasp but then withdraw; this pause reflects attention to setup rather than a lapse in technique. When the next bite is taken, the right-hand driver and left-hand forceps resume the familiar pattern, with the forceps presenting the near edge and then moving across to stabilize the far edge as the needle emerges. There are also interludes where the suture loop from a recently completed stitch is gently tensioned and seated, with no new tissue penetration—knot management rather than placement—ensuring each throw is flat and the knot stack compact.

Throughout, spatial relationships are consistent and deliberate. The two instruments bracket the slit, converging over each planned entry site and staying close to the wound to maintain control over needle trajectory. Entry points are placed a few millimeters from the cut edge to balance eversion against the risk of ischemic pressure. The suture is kept off adjacent, unused slits; loops are guided to fall away from the working field rather than over it. The driver always operates on the arc side of the needle, avoiding torque that would flatten the curve or force the needle through tissue at an oblique angle. The forceps are used to touch only the dermis, avoiding tooth impressions on the epidermis.

As the closure migrates toward the upper third of the incision, the wound shows clear, progressive approximation below. The upper segment remains open but is narrowed by the uniform, evenly spaced sutures already placed inferiorly. The operator reloads the needle carefully—consistently at the proximal third with the curve perpendicular to the driver—and rehearses the wrist motion needed for a precise bite. In one sequence near the top, edge control is intentionally minimal while the driver positions the needle, then the forceps step in to evert the near lip just before entry. This choreography ensures the bite lands true and symmetric, even without constant forceps pressure on the tissue. At the top, the surgeon works close to the apex; bites remain partial-thickness to dermal depth to preserve skin perfusion, and eversion is maintained even as instrument access becomes cramped. Tension is applied just enough to seat each knot without blanching.

There are rare moments when nearby incisions are visible and appear to be manipulated in the frame, but no stitch is finalized away from the line under closure. For instance, there is a short sequence in which instruments approach a right-sided incision; the needle is repositioned and edges are gently aligned, but no pass is completed and no knot is tied, keeping the operative narrative focused. Similarly, in frames where a midline slit is seen, the setup and needle positioning mirror exactly what is used elsewhere along the left vertical line; the pace of actual passage and tying on the left-sided wound confirms the continuity of work along that single closure. Whenever a knot is being tightened or the suture is being organized, other wounds are left undisturbed, underscoring the single-line focus of the technique.

By the time work concentrates near the upper third of the left vertical slit, the majority of the wound has been approximated with evenly spaced interrupted sutures. The inferior and mid segments are neatly closed with knots centered over the incision, mild, consistent edge eversion, and no visible inversion or gapping. The suture is managed so that tails fall predictably and do not interfere with subsequent bites. Instrument handling remains precise: drivers handle the needle with the jaws perpendicular to the curve; regrips are decisive; and passes are taken in a way that respects the needle’s arc, avoiding any “plunging” that could enlarge the holes or invert the edges. Where the operator pauses to reload, the hands hover in opposition over the wound, maintaining alignment and preserving the geometry for the next entry point. When tying, the hands pull in opposite directions along the long axis of the wound to snug the knot squarely without tilting it to either side.

Technique consistency is a hallmark of this closure from start to near-finish. Each stitch is approached with the same steps: precise perpendicular entry, controlled arc through dermis, matched exit, gentle withdrawal and transfer of the needle, deliberate suture draw-through, organized loop management, and instrument ties that are square and centered. The forceps are used to gently evert the edges, and the driver never forces the needle; instead, controlled wrist rotation does the work. Where minor deficiencies could be noted, they are brief and self-corrected: an instance of minimal edge control while setting up a bite is promptly followed by proper eversion with the forceps; a parked needle during knot management is secured in the driver rather than left free; a brief cross-over of instruments during tying is used purposefully to square the knot rather than reflecting disorganization. Importantly, despite occasional camera shifts and the presence of other incisions on the pad, the closure proceeds in a logical inferior-to-superior sequence along a single wound.

In the final scenes, the upper portion of the left vertical incision becomes the focus. The surgeon reloads the needle and aligns the tip perpendicular to the near edge, as before. The wound below shows clear evidence of prior, well-seated stitches; the superior-most segment is being readied for the next bite with the same suture handling discipline demonstrated throughout. Although some frames show positioning and setup without a completed pass, the progression is clear: the line has been methodically closed from the bottom upward, and only the last few bites near the top remain to be taken. No knots are tied on other lines, and no passes are finalized away from this closure. The suture line now appears mostly approximated, with mild, uniform eversion and tidy knots. The tissues appear aligned without step-off, and there is no evidence of excessive tension or strangulation.

Taken together, the procedure demonstrates a consistent simple interrupted closure technique on one vertical incision: starting at the inferior end with careful handling around the corner, establishing the first stitch with proper spacing, then moving cephalad with repeatable, symmetric dermal bites, instrument ties that are square and centered, and ongoing attention to suture and instrument management. The surgeon alternates hand roles as needed to preserve optimal approach angles, but the underlying mechanics never change. By the end of the recorded sequence, the wound is largely closed with prior stitches visible along most of its length; the operator is setting up for the next superior bite, keeping the same disciplined approach that characterized the earlier steps. The final state shows a nearly completed line with edges well approximated, knots seated on the incision, and the remaining superior segment prepared for closure in the same technique.
