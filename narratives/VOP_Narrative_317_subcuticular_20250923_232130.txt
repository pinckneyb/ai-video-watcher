COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with the central vertical incision—the short midline slit between two previously sutured lateral cuts—clearly identified and held as the focus throughout the video. At the outset the wound lies open, no knots tied over its length, and the team sets up in a classic two‑instrument configuration: a needle driver in one hand and tissue forceps in the other, tips straddling the wound so the instruments oppose across the dermal edges. From the first frames the operator grasps the curved needle in the driver—most commonly at the proximal third to midpoint of the curve—orienting the needle arc roughly perpendicular to the skin to obtain predictable entry and exit points. The non‑driving hand (holding Adson forceps or a second driver) consistently serves to present and evert the near/far dermal edge as each bite is taken, and frequently acts as the post during instrument ties.

Initial maneuvers concentrate on establishing an anchoring pass and seating the first throws at the superior apex of the midline incision. The needle is presented and driven from one skin margin to the other in a controlled arc, with the forceps gently elevating the opposite edge to expose the dermis and control depth. After full passage the driver re‑grasps to pull the strand through and the assistant or second instrument maintains counter‑tension so the edges approximate without blanching. Instrument ties are used early to secure the first suture loop: the assistant holds the standing end close to the wound while the driver forms the first instrument throw, then alternates wraps around the opposing instrument to create square, snug throws. Throughout these early tying sequences the instruments cross and meet directly over the incision; the suture tails are held lateral and slightly superior, and scissors are briefly brought in to trim tails when a knot is secured.

As the case progresses the technique evolves from these discrete interrupted maneuvers at the apex into a more continuous running pattern along the length of the central incision. The transition is gradual and deliberate: after seating an initial securing stitch near the superior edge, the needle is reoriented for shallow, intradermal passes. The driver is held low and close to the skin so the needle follows the subcuticular plane; the needle is commonly grasped a little farther from the tip for these shallow bites (about two‑thirds from the tip in many frames) to maximize control of the arc and minimize inadvertent pleating of the epidermis. The non‑driving hand shifts from acting as a tying post to acting predominantly as a tissue manipulator and suture tension controller—lifting tiny dermal flaps or using the suture itself to present the entry point—so that the needle can be advanced with short, symmetric bites along alternating sides of the dermal edge.

These intradermal, running passes produce the characteristic “railroad” series of small, evenly spaced dimples along the wound surface seen in later frames. Each bite is shallow and precise: the needle enters and exits within the dermis, staying just below the epidermis to bury the suture material. The operator reloads and reorients the needle between bites as needed, regrasping on the curve to maintain smooth arcs and consistent bite depth. The non‑driving hand maintains light counter‑tension on the long limb of the suture to remove slack and seat each bite, producing a near‑continuous coaptation of the epidermal edges without placing full‑thickness traction on the skin.

Hand positions remain remarkably consistent as the running closure continues. The driver usually works from one side of the incision (most often from the operator’s left relative to the wound) while the forceps or assisting instrument opposite it controls the far edge and the strand. Instruments straddle the wound and remain within a few millimeters of the dermal margin; their tips meet directly above the closure line when a needle passage completes. At times the surgeon parks the needle—tucking it outside the wound or into the driver—while the other hand pulls on the long limb to advance the continuous strand and redistribute tension. On other occasions the left and right hands trade roles briefly (for example, the left hand becomes the post and the right hand wraps the throws) to complete instrument ties when securing a terminal loop or resetting the running line.

Tissue handling emphasizes gentle eversion and precise presentation of the dermis. Forceps are used to tent the epidermal‑dermal junction so bites are taken at a uniform distance from the edge, and care is taken not to crush or excessively tension the tissue; prior passes are gently tensioned to remove visible gaps while avoiding blanching. Where a deeper, full‑thickness bite is required (early anchoring passes are sometimes a bit deeper), the team rapidly reverts to perpendicular needle entry and then returns to the subcuticular arc for subsequent runs. This intermittent variation in bite depth is evident across frames but is handled deliberately—initial full or dermal‑to‑dermal entries to establish purchase, followed by more superficial passes to create the aesthetic buried closure.

The continuous pattern advances in an orderly fashion from one end toward the other. Multiple sequential bites are taken a few millimeters apart, creating a uniform line of approximation. Between bites the non‑driving hand frequently pulls the long strand superiorly or laterally to maintain consistent suture orientation and to prevent entanglement with adjacent, already‑sutured lines on the pad. At several points the operator uses the forceps to stabilize the standing end while the driver wraps instrument throws around it to lock a segment or to re‑anchor the running suture—these intermittent instrument ties serve to control slack and to prevent loosening as subsequent bites are placed.

Knotting technique is consistently instrument‑based: alternate instrument throws with the driver and forceps forming loops, the driver advancing the free end and then the role reversing for subsequent throws. During tying, instruments approximate the wound line; the forceps usually act as the post immediately adjacent to the dermal edge while the driver wraps and pulls the knot down to the tissue. The suture tails are oriented superior‑right and inferior‑left at times, and the team makes deliberate choices about which tail is used to form throws so that knots sit flush and do not pucker the skin. After a final securing throw the scissors approach in a controlled, overhead manner and trim the excess suture close to the knot—scissor blades aligned parallel to the incision to avoid traumatizing adjacent tissue.

Throughout the case there are brief moments when attention shifts away from the midline closure—other lateral incisions receive individual interrupted stitches or knot‑securing maneuvers in a few frames. Occasionally frames show stitches placed and tied on the right‑hand incision, and later frames show partially placed but untied bites along a different vertical cut. These alternations create some variability in the visual record, but the central running closure remains the principal, continuous activity. Where other wounds are tied or trimmed, those steps either precede or follow the central running sequence; when hands briefly leave the field the central line retains a suture strand that is either parked or being tensioned intermittently by the assistant.

As the running subcuticular closure approaches its terminal segment the operator brings closure to the superior apex. The last few bites are completed in the same shallow dermal plane, and the strand is then drawn carefully to seat the final approximation. A terminal loop or locking sequence is fashioned: the driver forms instrument throws around the standing end held as the post, alternating directions for successive throws to create a secure knot that resists slippage. The forceps are used as the post in most of these final throws, then the driver completes the final cinch to seat the knot firmly against the dermis without overcompressing the edges. Once the knot is secure, the scissors are deployed over the superior end and the free tail is trimmed close to the knot, leaving a short tail that minimizes prominence.

Final inspection shows a continuous, buried closure along the midline with evenly spaced superficial dimples where the intradermal bites emerged. The skin edges are well approximated without gross gapping; slight eversion at the stitch sites is visible—a desirable effect produced by the buried dermal purchase. The knot at the superior apex is seated and trimmed. Throughout the line tension is consistent: no significant bunching or blanching is seen, and the wound maintains an even contour. The instruments and hands withdraw and the suture field is left neat, with previously sutured adjacent lines remaining closed and, where indicated earlier in the sequence, other incisions already secured with interrupted stitches.

A few procedural inconsistencies are apparent in the timeline: early anchoring passes are occasionally deeper and full‑thickness compared with the later, more technically refined intradermal bites; at times work briefly shifts to different incisions where interrupted techniques are used; and there are frames where previously placed bites are visible but left untied for a short interval. These observations reflect practical intraoperative sequencing—establishing purchase, advancing a running buried closure, intermittently tensioning or trimming, and returning to secure terminal knots—rather than a fundamental change in intent. Overall, the progression is from initial anchoring toward a controlled, continuous subcuticular closure, executed with consistent instrument opposition, precise needle regrasping, judicious use of forceps to evert and present tissue, and instrument‑based knotting to secure the terminal loop.

In summary, the midline vertical wound is approached with measured technique: early full bites and instrument ties establish purchase, the needle driver adopts a low‑profile arc for a running intradermal course, the non‑driving hand transitions from a tying post to a tension‑controlling assistant, and the entire line is completed as a continuous buried closure. Final steps include secure instrument throws at the apex, trimming of the tail close to the knot, and a clean, approximated wound with a uniform line of intradermal dimpling that reflects consistent bite depth and symmetry.
