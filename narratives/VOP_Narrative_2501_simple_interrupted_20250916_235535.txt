COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The closure unfolds as a single, continuous repair of the right‑most vertical incision on the pad, proceeding from its lower third upward toward the superior end using the same suturing technique throughout (instrument‑tied, interrupted stitches with bites placed perpendicular to the wound edges). Two other parallel slits to the left remain unclosed and largely untouched during the sequence; when they occasionally enter the frame they are not used for passage or tying.

The work begins at the lower half of the right‑side incision. With the field oriented so the wound runs vertically, the left hand initially holds the needle holder while the right hand lifts the near/right edge with forceps to present the dermal entry point. The curved needle is set in the driver at about the proximal-third to mid‑body and aligned nearly perpendicular to the skin. The tip is positioned a few millimeters from the right wound margin at the lower third, and the first bite is initiated from right to left in standard fashion. No knot is yet secured at this moment.

A brief interlude follows in which the operator brings the needle toward the central slit, tenting its right lower margin with forceps and beginning to position a first bite there. No stitch is placed or tied on that line; it functions as a momentary alignment and setup sequence. The operator promptly returns to the right‑most incision and continues the actual closure there. From this point forward, all placement, tying, and cutting occur on the same right‑most vertical wound.

Working again on the right‑side slit, the right hand now takes the needle driver while the left hand alternates between forceps and managing the free strand. The needle is passed with a gentle wrist rotation from the right lip across toward the left lip. The suture is pulled through, and the driver and assisting hand begin forming loops for an instrument tie. Within this early phase the first stitch is fully secured at the lower third, and immediately afterward a second stitch is placed adjacent to it along the same line, again with perpendicular bites and an instrument tie. By the time this segment concludes, two simple interrupted stitches are present at the lower portion of the wound. Knot tails are trimmed short on the lateral (right) side of the incision.

As work progresses, hand roles evolve fluidly with the needs of each maneuver. At times the right hand remains on the driver throughout while the left hand measures bite spacing with fingertips, stabilizes the pad, or controls the standing end to square the knot. At other moments, the left hand assumes driver control to regrip the needle or guide the suture during tying, while the right hand uses forceps to evert the near/right edge or briefly brings in scissors to cut tails once a knot is set. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument at any given moment, the spatial relationship is consistent: the needle holder works just lateral and slightly superior to the current bite site on the right lip, the assisting hand opposes it across the slit to stabilize the entry edge or manage strand tension, and the suture tails lie to the right of the wound, with knots and cut ends seated on that lateral side.

Through the lower third, the operator demonstrates careful bite placement—perpendicular approach, roughly symmetric depth and spacing across the wound, and gentle traction to avoid crushing the synthetic skin. Where forceps are used, they lift the wound margin lightly to present the dermis, encouraging slight eversion. In some sequences finger pads substitute for forceps, pressing near the margin to guide depth and protect opposing tissue as the needle arcs through.

After the first two stitches are secured and cut at the lower half, the operator transitions cephalad along the right‑most slit. The next series of frames shows setup and tying behavior near the mid‑portion: the needle sometimes rests parked on the free end while the driver completes an instrument tie; at other times it is briefly regripped during throws to maintain strand control. In these mid‑range frames, the camera occasionally crops tightly on the immediate tying site, and not all previously placed stitches are visible at once; nonetheless, the closure remains confined to the same right‑hand incision, and previously placed stitches persist below the working zone even when temporarily out of frame.

With the lower closures stable, the operator prepares to advance further up the wound. The right hand holds the needle driver superior‑right to the slit, while the left hand, often with forceps, steadies the near edge and everts it slightly. The needle is grasped at the proximal third and presented perpendicular to the skin, then passed from right to left in a controlled arc. After passage, the driver retrieves the needle, draws the loop across the gap, and initiates tying. The technique remains consistent: instrument ties seated neatly with the knot and tails oriented to the right/lateral side.

This mid‑course work culminates in the third stitch. The sequences show a clear progression: after two completed sutures are visible, a new pass is made more proximally along the same slit; the loop is handled and tying begins; scissors appear to trim tails once the knot is seated. By the time the scissors withdraw, three completed interrupted stitches are present along the right‑most incision, aligned cranial‑caudal and spaced to approximate the edges without strangulation or excessive inversion. The three‑stitch state is verified repeatedly across multiple adjacent segments as the operator moves yet more superiorly toward the top of the incision.

Approaching the upper third, the right hand again controls the needle driver just above and lateral to the wound’s superior segment. The left hand alternates between forceps to evert the entry edge and simple digital tension on the suture tail to keep the field clear of loops. The needle is oriented close to ninety degrees to the skin, bites are taken with appropriate width on the near/right margin, and the curve is followed across to the far edge. Several sequences capture this precise positioning and passage behavior without an immediate knot, emphasizing controlled placement before tying. The wound edges are already well‑approximated by the three distal stitches, and the new pass adds closure to the remaining open segment.

At the upper portion, the operator completes the tying of the fourth stitch. The needle is not driven further in those tying frames; rather, the driver is used to secure throws over the standing end, snugging the knot down squarely. Scissors appear to trim the tails once the knot is locked. With that, the suture count increases from three to four completed interrupted stitches. The four‑stitch state is corroborated across subsequent sequences: when the operator initiates what looks like another bite near the superior end, those actions do not result in an additional finished stitch within the observed windows. Likewise, sequences showing tensioning or tail trimming at the top of the line do not change the completed count. The wound edges along the entire right‑most slit are now aligned, with each knot lying on the lateral/right side and spacing that reflects consistent bite size and throw security.

Throughout, the hands and instruments maintain predictable spatial choreography relative to the incision:
- Early on, the left hand often holds the driver while the right hand’s forceps evert the near margin for entry. As the procedure evolves, the dominant hand (more often the right) assumes the driver for most passes.
- During bite placement, the driver stays just lateral and slightly superior to the bite site with the needle aligned perpendicular to the wound; the assisting hand opposes it across the slit, either with forceps for precise purchase or with fingertips to stabilize the pad and manage depth.
- During tying, the driver crosses over the wound as needed to lay loops, while the non‑driver hand maintains counter‑tension on the tail. Knots are seated with calm, square movements, and tails are cut short with scissors that briefly cross the field, then withdraw.
- Moving cranial to caudal (or vice versa depending on the camera angle), the hands “leapfrog” along the slit, working a few millimeters apart to place evenly spaced interrupted stitches.

A few frames introduce a description of a “short” or “slightly oblique” right‑sided cut while two stitches sit to its right end; this appears to be the same right‑most wound viewed from a different camera angle or with the pad rotated, given that the subsequent and preceding sequences continue seamlessly along the same right‑most line with the same pattern of stitches and the other central slits remaining untouched. In those frames, the technique and progression match the ongoing closure—perpendicular bites, instrument ties, and a new stitch being advanced leftward (i.e., proximally along the repair), consistent with the same continuous line of work.

Technique remains internally consistent with the selected method across the case. The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body, entries are nearly perpendicular to optimize bite symmetry and eversion, and instrument ties secure each stitch before the next is initiated. Where the left hand substitutes fingertip stabilization for pickups, the overall intent—control of edge eversion and protection of tissue during needle passage—remains the same. Traction is gentle, and there is no evidence of excessive crushing or over‑tightening; edges approximate with minimal gapping.

By the end of the sequence, activity ceases and the field goes static. The right‑most incision is the only line with sutures; the two central slits remain without closure. No hands or instruments are in contact with the wound, and the configuration of ties is stable.

Suture count and progression, verified
- Initial placement phase: The lower third of the right‑most slit is addressed first. The first stitch is placed and tied, followed immediately by a second adjacent interrupted stitch. This brings the count to 2 completed stitches in the lower half.
- Middle segment: The operator advances superiorly. After positioning and passage, a third stitch is tied and the tails trimmed, increasing the total to 3 completed stitches spaced along the lower‑to‑mid portion of the right‑most slit.
- Superior segment: A final pass is placed near the top of the wound and tied with an instrument tie. Scissors trim the tails. This raises the total to 4 completed stitches along the right‑most slit.
- After this point, several sequences show additional positioning or tightening near the superior end, but no further knots are finished; the count remains unchanged.

Final state
- The procedure results in 4 completed sutures on the right‑most vertical incision. This count is explicitly visible and repeatedly confirmed in the closing sequences, including 315–329 s (after finishing and trimming at the upper portion), 330–374 s (work continues without adding another finished stitch), 375–389 s (tightening/cutting activity with no new stitch), and 390–398 s (static field with no changes). The stitch line shows four evenly spaced simple interrupted knots with tails seated laterally on the right side, approximating the wound edges from the lower third to the upper end. The other two vertical slits on the pad remain untouched and without sutures.

Hand position evolution and spatial consistency across time
- Early set‑up: Left hand on the driver and right hand with forceps position the first bite at the lower third of the right‑most slit, entering the right margin and passing right‑to‑left.
- Establishing the lower closures: The right hand takes over the driver, the left hand manages the free strand and occasionally everts the edge. Instrument ties are thrown with the driver crossing the wound; tails are cut with scissors that cross in briefly from the left or superior‑lateral side.
- Mid‑line advancement: The right hand remains the primary driver above and lateral to the growing line of knots; the left hand alternates between forceps for eversion and fingers to stabilize the pad and tension the standing end.
- Superior advance and finish: The right hand continues placement and then uses scissors to trim after tying; the left hand’s role is intermittent for stabilization and strand control. As the final knot is tied and cut, only the right hand remains in the field, and then all instruments withdraw, leaving the four‑suture line intact.

Technique consistency
- The same suturing technique is maintained throughout: interrupted stitches placed with the needle at roughly 90 degrees to the skin, bites taken symmetrically across the incision, loops created and secured via instrument ties, and knots seated square with tails trimmed short. Where brief observational inconsistencies occur—such as counts fluctuating when the camera crops tightly or shifts angle—these reflect field of view limitations rather than actual removal or addition of stitches outside the consistent, stepwise progression described above.

In sum, the closure is a coherent, single‑line repair of the right‑most vertical incision executed with consistent interrupted technique from inferior to superior. The stitch count rises in a logical sequence—first one, then two in the lower third; a third in the mid‑portion; and a fourth at the superior end—before the field goes quiet. Final verification: four completed sutures are present at the end of the procedure, with edges well approximated and all knot tails lying laterally on the right side of the wound.
