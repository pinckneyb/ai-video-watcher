COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a steady, methodical setup on the rightmost incision of a synthetic skin pad. From the start, the operator establishes a consistent posture and working triangle: the left hand, entering from the superior/central aspect, carries the needle driver; the right hand, from the inferior/right, uses toothed forceps to control the wound edge or the suture as needed. The needle is routinely loaded at the proximal-to-mid third of the curve, oriented perpendicular to the pad, and the suture is managed out to the right to keep the field clean.

Early progression (0–59 s) shows the first bites and early rhythm. The right hand uses gentle dermal edge control to evert the near lip as the left hand rotates the needle through in a smooth arc. After the needle exits, the right hand retrieves the tip and pulls the strand through, leaving a controlled tail. The left hand briefly reaches toward scissors at the end of this sequence, but cutting is deferred—priority remains on secure needle control and staging for the next move.

A brief organizing phase follows (60–104 s). The left hand lifts the needle away from the pad and off to the right to reload and refine orientation, while the right hand remains quiet or assists with the needle body. Several regrips confirm the driver’s hold at the proximal third, maintaining a perpendicular approach for the next pass. This is a clean, preparatory interlude with no tissue penetration—just efficient tool management and alignment.

Knot tying begins (105–149 s). With the needle parked, the left-hand driver executes instrument ties while the right hand manages the free end and tail tension. Throws are advanced with alternating traction to seat the knot flush across the incision. Once secure, the right hand picks up scissors and neatly trims the tails beside the knot while the left hand provides counter-tension with the driver. The field then clears briefly as both hands reset for the next stitch.

With the first knot cut, the operator returns to a productive stitching cadence (150–209 s). The left hand again drives the needle in a perpendicular, wrist-rotated arc while the right hand stabilizes the near edge, then helps with needle delivery and suture pull-through. Between passes, the right hand intermittently releases the tissue to tidy the suture line and present the needle for regrasping. Multiple segments here show reloading and staging—precise, unhurried, and consistent—without unnecessary manipulation of the edges.

The mid-procedure sequences (210–269 s) are characterized by deliberate setup and two-instrument loading. The needle holder remains central/superior; the right-hand forceps or a second driver briefly stabilizes the needle to allow the left hand to choke up or adjust angle. The tip is always brought back perpendicular to the target bite site. This repeated choreography—present, regrasp, align—keeps the needle arc true while the suture is drawn laterally to the right, ready for the next throw. No new passes are captured here; it’s a careful prelude to efficient execution.

Cutting and consolidation intersperse the work (270–299 s). The left hand steadies the standing end with the driver near the knot stack while the right hand uses scissors to trim tails close to the prior knots—precise, without tissue compression. Immediately after, the hands reposition: the right hand with forceps and the left with the driver return over the rightmost wound, reestablishing the working triangle.

Active passage resumes (300–329 s). The needle completes an exit on the far side; the right hand takes the tip, pulls the suture through, and the left hand releases and prepares to reload. In the very next sequence, forceps lift and evert the near edge; the left hand drives the needle in, and the right hand captures the tip to shepherd it safely through, then releases for a smooth pull-through. Bites appear symmetric and aligned with prior stitches.

Now the rhythm is fully fluent (330–374 s). The right hand everts and stabilizes the edge with fine, atraumatic pickups; the left hand works just lateral to the wound, entering perpendicular and following the curve. Sequential dermal bites progress along the rightmost incision, with the driver and forceps operating at close working distance without crossing. Occasionally, the right hand pauses to clear loops of suture, keeping the line to the right, away from the bite site.

Fine alignment and micro-adjustments continue (375–404 s). The driver briefly regrips to perfect the bite angle; the right hand alternates between gentle tissue control and managing the suture tail under light tension. A cut follows: the left hand enters with scissors to trim the most recent knot while the right hand steadies the line with forceps. With tails clipped, the right hand re-enters holding a loaded needle driver, ready to continue.

A short pause in activity is captured (405–434 s). The right hand retrieves and transfers the needle to the left-hand driver, then both instruments withdraw to reset. There’s a brief moment where a needle is held in forceps and then taken out—no penetration in this interlude—suggesting a tidy reload off-field and repositioning for the next placement.

Setup, pass, and finish repeat efficiently (435–464 s). The left hand, central and superior, sets a perfect 90-degree approach while the right hand everts the near edge. The needle is driven and delivered across with a smooth pronation–supination motion. The needle is then lifted clear and parked as the suture is tensioned to approximate edges. The right hand trims tails close to the knot while the left hand stabilizes—each step economical and controlled.

Late-phase sequences (465–494 s) show mature, steady technique. The left hand reloads and optimizes the grasp angle; the right hand controls the edge or suture as required. Trimming occurs again near the knot stack, always with counter-tension and clean margins. Across these frames, the stitch line grows with evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures, knots consistently placed to the right.

The close of the procedure (495–521 s) is quiet. A brief approach with needle driver and forceps hovers over the right wound edge, then withdraws without a bite—likely a final check or pause. The field becomes static, and a card is placed over the model; instruments rest at the margins. No further manipulation occurs, signaling the end of the suturing sequence.

Across the entire clip, the technique is consistent and disciplined:
- The left hand almost always drives: grasp at the proximal third, needle perpendicular to tissue, smooth wrist rotation following the curve, and careful needle parking between steps.
- The right hand alternates roles seamlessly: eversion and edge control at the dermal margin, tip capture and delivery, suture management to maintain a clear field, and timely scissor work for tidy tails.
- Movements are economical, with minimal instrument crossing, suture kept lateral and under control, and repeated use of two-instrument loading for precise needle orientation.
- The flow cycles cleanly: orient and evert → drive and deliver → pull-through and tension → tie and trim → reload and advance. Knots land consistently on the right side, edges approximate without crushing, and stitch spacing remains even along the rightmost incision.

The resulting narrative is of a calm, efficient series of simple interrupted sutures placed along the right wound, punctuated by deliberate reloading, secure instrument ties, and careful trimming—an organized, rhythmic closure that concludes with the field cleared and the work complete.
