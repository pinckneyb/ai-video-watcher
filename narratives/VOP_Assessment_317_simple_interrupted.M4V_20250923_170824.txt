COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a multi‑slit silicone practice pad but remains focused on closing a single short vertical cut on the left half of the pad using simple interrupted sutures. Across the session, the operator returns to this same wound segment repeatedly, building the closure from its inferior end toward the superior end with a consistent interrupted technique, interspersed with moments of reloading, knot management, and trimming. Occasional changes in camera angle and pad orientation make the incision appear oblique or temporarily transverse in a few brief views; nevertheless, the work consistently advances along the same left‑side vertical slit, and the already placed stitches and the developing “ladder” of knots repeatedly reappear as landmarks to confirm continuity.

The sequence begins with a dry setup, the instruments forming the classic working triangle on an unopened central slit while the actual closure site is identified. With no tissue manipulation yet, the needle is loaded in the driver between the proximal third and mid‑body, presented at a right angle to the pad—appropriate for a forehand bite—and kept just above the plane of the skin. The right hand is poised with tissue forceps, ready to evert the wound edge, while the left hand controls the needle driver. This positioning phase is brief, and in short order the operator shifts focus to the left‑side target wound.

At the inferior end of this left vertical incision, the first stitch is laid in. The operator approaches with the driver while the assisting hand uses Adson‑style forceps to gently lift the dermal margin. Entry is perpendicular, and the driver’s wrist follows the curve of the needle to pass through the near edge and out through the far edge with symmetric bite depth. The needle is regrasped for delivery across the gap, and the suture is drawn through without snagging. The edges approximate cleanly with slight eversion as traction is applied to the strand.

With the first pass complete, attention turns to knot security. The curved needle is kept safely out of the way—often parked distally on the long limb or held in the driver with the tip facing away—to avoid inadvertent injury or tissue catch during tying. Instrument ties are performed in series: the long limb is looped around the jaws of the needle driver, the driver reaches to grasp the short tail, and the throw is advanced down to the wound. The forceps occasionally stabilize a wound edge as the knot is seated. Alternating throws square the knot; when sufficient throws have been laid to secure it, the right hand introduces scissors to trim the tails close, parallel to the incision to avoid fraying or loosening. This first knot sits just to the left of midline, which becomes a consistent pattern throughout—knot stacks lie to the left side, forming a tidy row.

Immediately after trimming, the operator reloads the needle and reapproaches the same incision to place the next stitch. In some views, the pad’s orientation makes the short segment look oblique or nearly transverse near the lower‑left corner, but the technique remains unchanged: forceps gently evert the margins, the needle is oriented perpendicular to the skin, and the driver’s wrist rotation continues the curve of the needle through both edges. After the bite, the suture is pulled through, the needle is again parked, and instrument ties are performed to secure the stitch. Multiple frames capture these tying sequences in detail: the long limb is drawn diagonally across the field, the driver loops it, grasps the tail, and cinches down; then the direction is alternated to lay square throws. Care is taken not to crush the pad edges; the wound blanches just slightly under tension, indicating the throws are snug without ischemia. Scissors reappear to clip tails after the knot is secure.

As the closure progresses upward along the same left slit, the operator demonstrates flexible hand dominance. For one pass, the driver is in the right hand and the forceps in the left, with the right hand executing the arc of the bite and the left stabilizing and receiving the needle. In other moments—particularly during tying—the driver is held in the left hand while the right hand manages the free end or forceps. This ambidextrous alternation allows precise approach angles at different positions along the incision without crowding the wound. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument at any given moment, the needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body, and its orientation remains perpendicular to the skin surface for controlled entry. Bites are placed close to the margin, with matching depth across the gap to maintain eversion and even approximation.

The middle portion of the procedure is dominated by a rhythm of stitch placement and secure tying along the left slit. The already placed stitches stabilize the wound, so during each new pass only minimal tissue manipulation is needed—just enough with the forceps to present the dermal edge. The suture is drawn through smoothly, slack removed, and then the driver serves as a tying instrument. The operator often parks the needle on the long limb away from the field during these throws, and the forceps, when used, touch the skin lightly to prevent crushing. The long strand is sometimes held taut across the field—drawn superiorly and to the right—to form well‑controlled loops before being brought back to square and seat the knot at the edge.

After several interrupted stitches have been completed inferiorly, the field shows a characteristic ladder: closely spaced knots with their tails trimmed short, lying primarily to the left of the wound. With the inferior and mid portions approximated, the work advances to the superior end of the same slit. Here the operator continues with the same method. The right hand may take the driver to gain a favorable approach, with the left hand’s forceps everting the far edge; the needle is advanced in an arc, regrasped for delivery, and the suture is pulled through. Multiple sequences show the needle then being released so that the driver can be used purely for instrument ties—looping the long strand, grasping the short tail, alternating directions to square the throws, and cinching down. Between throws, the assisting hand steadies the right wound edge or simply holds the tail off to the side to maintain a clear corridor over the slit.

In one interlude, the camera isolates a short vertical nick just left of center in the superior field and captures the complete placement and tying of a single stitch on that segment. The technique and handling are identical—perpendicular entry, arc‑following wrist motion, needle parked for tying, instrument throws advanced and squared, and tails trimmed. Although this vignette is momentarily framed without the previously placed knot row in view, the subsequent sequences return immediately to the same left‑side vertical wound and pick up again at its superior end, with the same ladder of knots and the same laterality of tail position. The continuity of technique, instrument choreography, and the reappearance of the existing stitch line strongly indicate that this interlude is simply the upper portion of the same wound captured under a tighter crop.

As the operator continues to work at the apex of the wound, several runs show the precise interplay required to seat knots flush at the edge without dragging skin. The forceps may lightly lift the right edge as the knot is guided down; the driver maintains a low profile just above the skin, pushing the knot to the intended side so that knot stacks consistently lie leftward. The long strand is kept organized and angled across the field to prevent tangles, then straightened as the knot is squared. The superior area shows mild puckering as the last few stitches bring previously gaping edges together—expected when the final spans are closed on a small, somewhat elastic synthetic surface. Despite the localized tension, the edges remain well‑everted and evenly approximated.

Instrument exchange and reloading are quick and deliberate. When preparing for yet another bite at the top, the needle is grasped on its proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and the driver approaches the near edge. The assistant hand—whether using forceps or just fingertips—presents the tissue and protects the margin during exit. The needle is regrasped deftly to complete the passage, demonstrating controlled wrist rotation that preserves the curve’s integrity and prevents tearing. The suture is pulled through in a straight line to avoid sawing at the skin edge. After each pass, the needle is turned away and secured while instrument ties are thrown.

Multiple tying sequences are captured in close‑up at this stage: the long limb is wrapped, the driver reaches through, grasps the short tail, and draws it back, sliding the throw smoothly to the skin surface. The operator alternates hands and throw directions to lay square knots and occasionally uses a surgeon’s throw when a first throw needs extra friction to hold tension before a second throw is added. The assistant hand sometimes takes a brief hold of the knot itself or presses gently with a finger pad to seat the coil where intended. Once secured, scissors are introduced from the superior right, aligned parallel to the incision to snip tails close without upsetting the knot or the approximation.

Throughout the latter part of the closure, the superior end of the wound gets the most attention. New bites are placed there, woven among the existing ladder, and then tied. Between passes the driver may hover or park just to the left of the wound, the forceps to the right. The long strand often tracks diagonally across from left to right before being brought back for tying, a pattern consistent with keeping the needle parked on the long end while performing instrument ties. The superior puckering lessens as stitches are evenly spaced and tension shares across the series; any residual wrinkling is mild and localized to the topmost knot stack.

The very final sequences are quiet: the wound sits left of center, with a short series of closely spaced simple interrupted stitches, knot tails trimmed short and lying to the left side. There is no instrument in the field. The edges are well approximated along the entire length, with slight eversion and a trace of blanching where the superior knots were just set. The surrounding slits on the pad are untouched. No additional passes are taken in the closing moments.

Technique highlights and evolution over the session are consistent and instructive:
- Needle handling remains disciplined—grasped at the proximal third to midpoint, kept perpendicular to the skin for each entry, and followed through the arc without wrist deviation. When not driving, the needle is deliberately parked on the long strand or secured in the driver away from tissue and gloves.
- Tissue handling with forceps is gentle and precise—edges are picked up close to the margin to evert and present the dermis, then released as soon as the needle is through. There is no excessive crush or tooth‑on‑edge pressure; the operator uses the suture tension itself to complete approximation.
- Instrument ties are the cornerstone of knot security—loops are formed cleanly around the driver, the short tail is captured reliably, and alternating throws square and lock each stitch. When needed, the first throw is laid as a surgeon’s throw to hold tension before the following square throws are added.
- Spatial choreography is consistent—hands oppose each other across the slit, with the driver typically just left of the incision and the forceps or suture‑managing hand to the right. The long strand is carried out of the way during passage, then brought back across the wound to lay throws. Scissors approach parallel to the incision to trim tails close without destabilizing the knot.

By the end, the left‑side vertical wound is closed with a tidy row of simple interrupted sutures. The knot stacks sit to the left, tails are short and uniform, the edges are evenly approximated with slight eversion, and only mild, localized puckering remains superiorly where the last throws were tied. No gaps are visible, no new passes are attempted after the final trim, and the field is left clean and undisturbed, demonstrating a complete, orderly closure achieved with a consistent interrupted technique from the inferior to the superior end of the same incision.
