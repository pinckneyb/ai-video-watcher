COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure proceeds as a steady, methodical closure of a single linear skin incision located on the left side of the practice skin pad. From the first frames to the last, the operator works exclusively along that same incision line, advancing closure bite by bite from one end toward the other. The technique used is the sequential placement of simple interrupted skin sutures with careful tissue handling, although a few brief frames show maneuvers that resemble suture management or short continuous passes; these are transient and do not alter the overall interrupted‑stitch strategy.

Initial approach and exposure
At the outset the wound is a short, clean linear incision in the left quadrant of the pad. The operator establishes a compact working field with both hands inside the sterile zone. A needle driver is carried in the dominant hand and fine toothed Adson‑style forceps (or equivalent thumb forceps) in the nondominant. The instruments are brought to the wound within a few centimeters of each other to create a narrow triangle of control over each bite. The forceps are used to lift and evert the near wound edge while the needle driver positions a curved, swaged needle over the opposite margin. Throughout the early frames the needle is routinely grasped in the driver near the mid‑shaft or toward the swaged end (depending on the pass), the curve of the needle oriented to permit a smooth arcing motion through the dermal layer. The operator consistently approaches the tissue with the needle tip at a near‑perpendicular-to‑moderate angle to take full‑thickness or dermal/epidermal catches depending on the bite location.

Sequential placement and stitch technique
Closure proceeds in a stepwise fashion: the operator identifies an empty gap between existing knots and places a new stitch. Each pass follows a repeated choreography — the forceps elevate and slightly evert the near edge to expose an appropriate bite depth; the needle driver rotates the curved needle through the opposing edge in a controlled arc; the suture is drawn through and the two instrument tips converge to retrieve the needle or prepare the tails for knotting. Hands stay close to the wound for fine control (typically within a few centimeters), with the nondominant hand stabilizing tissue and the dominant hand delivering the needle.

Needle grasp varies with task. For initial passes intended to control needle trajectory the driver often grips nearer the middle portion of the needle curve, allowing a broad arc to be executed; as the needle is about to be retrieved or when finer control for a shallow bite is needed the grasp shifts toward the needle’s body or proximal third. These adjustments are purposeful: mid‑shaft grips allow wider rotation to carry a full arc through tissue, while more proximal or distal grips permit finer tip control as the needle exits the far edge. On occasion the operator re‑grasps the needle after partial passage to reposition for withdrawal or knot preparation.

Tissue handling and edge approximation
Tissue handling is consistently atraumatic and precise. The Adson forceps are used to pinch only the epidermal/dermal margin, not to bulkily clamp surrounding tissue. The near edge is lifted to produce slight eversion so that when the suture is tied the skin margins will sit apposed and slightly outward — a standard strategy to avoid inversion during healing. Throughout the sequence the bites are placed relatively close to the wound edge (small margin), producing slightly everted, neatly opposed edges without puckering. The operator avoids wide bites or excessive tension; when suture tails are managed the contralateral hand or a hemostat intermittently assists to keep strands under control.

Hand positions and instrument relationships
Hand positions evolve subtly but predictably over time to support the sequential work along the incision. At the start the needle driver and forceps flank the wound in tight opposition; the driver frequently approaches from above/medial while the forceps come from lateral/inferior (or vice versa depending on the bite). As the row progresses, the hands travel along the length of the incision in small increments, remaining close to recent knots to place the next stitch in the adjacent empty gap. The relative orientation of the instruments often alternates: sometimes the driver is superior and the forceps inferior, other times the driver approaches from lateral or oblique angles — the pattern reflects small adjustments required to reach each successive bite point.

Instrument convergence is a constant: tips meet over the wound at needle exit/entry points. The nondominant hand sometimes changes from forceps to fingertip manipulation or uses a hemostat to control suture tails; on some passes the operator stabilizes the pad with fingertips while advancing the needle to maintain consistent tension and needle trajectory. There are also brief intervals where only one hand is visible or the non‑dominant hand trails out of frame; during those moments the dominant hand continues to manage the needle and suture, indicating the operator is capable of single‑handed retrieval or knot management when necessary.

Progression and management of suture material
Sutures are advanced sequentially, with the operator placing a new interrupted stitch into the gap between previously tied stitches. After needle exit, the suture is drawn through and the instrumented hands coordinate to bring tails into position for knot tying. In many frames the operator begins to tension and tie knots immediately after needle passage; in others the suture is repositioned, tails managed with a hemostat, or the needle is re‑grasped to assist with the knot. The operator varies between grasping the needle near the swage for robust control and more distal grasping when finer tip manipulation is needed; a few frames show the needle being held closer to the shaft which slightly reduces arc control, but the operator compensates with more deliberate rotation and hand placement.

Technique consistency and occasional deviations
Throughout the recording the overarching method is stable: placement of simple interrupted sutures with small dermal/epidermal bites, eversion of edges, and stepwise progression along the incision. The operator’s motions remain deliberate and controlled; bite depth and spacing are consistent, producing uniform approximation. A small number of frames depict actions consistent with knot management or suture‑tail handling rather than fresh needle passes, and one or two frames briefly suggest a short continuous-running motion, but these moments are limited to suture advancement or temporary positioning rather than a change to a continuous suture technique. Any apparent deviations do not disrupt the general pattern of sequential interrupted closure.

Technique maturation over time
As the sequence continues, a subtle refinement in efficiency is evident. Early passes show more frequent re‑grasping and repositioning of the needle; later passes demonstrate smoother arcs with fewer adjustments, suggesting the operator becomes more confident with the needle trajectory and tissue response. Knot tying and suture management also become more economical — tails are gathered and secured more quickly, and the operator alternates instrument grips to maintain knot tension without undue fiddling. When only one hand is visible, that hand is often efficiently finishing a knot or trimming a tail, indicating growing economy of movement.

Spatial dynamics along the incision
The operator works along the incision in a contiguous, linear progression. Instrument positions translate together along the wound: as the row advances the needle driver and forceps shift proximally or distally in small increments, maintaining the same opposing relationship across the margin. When working at the superior end the driver may be anchored vertically above the site while the other instrument approaches obliquely; at the lateral end the driver sometimes approaches at an oblique angle to accommodate the curvature of the pad, but the working triangle is preserved. Hands frequently cross slightly above the wound to allow the driver to complete the arc and the forceps to receive the needle, creating the crossed, triangular working zone noted in multiple observations.

Management of challenging moments
There are intermittent instances where the operator’s grip on the needle is more proximal than ideal or where only a single hand is visible performing tying and suture control. In such moments the operator compensates by altering approach angles, re‑positioning the forceps to present tissue more favorably, or using a hemostat to secure a tail. This adaptability keeps the closure progressing smoothly despite minor suboptimal needle holds. The operator consistently avoids excessive traction on the substrate, preserving tissue integrity in the simulated pad.

Final passes and completion
As the row nears completion, the operator places the last sequential stitches at the cranial (or superior) end of the incision. Needle passes are completed, tails are tensioned and cut, and knots are finalized. The last frames show the operator occasionally using a single hand to control the needle driver and suture while the other hand may be momentarily out of frame or using fingertips for final tensioning. A few final touches include adjusting suture tails, trimming, and smoothing the line so the approximated edges sit uniformly everted.

Final state of closure
When finished, the incision is uniformly approximated along its length with a neat, evenly spaced row of simple interrupted sutures. The wound edges are slightly everted, minimizing inversion and optimizing dermal edge-to-edge apposition. Gapping is minimal and there is no overt evidence of tissue strangulation from over‑tight knots; tension is appropriate and distributed across the line. The suture tails have been managed and some trimmed; any residual suture material lies adjacent to the closure. Overall, the series of stitches presents a tidy, consistent closure appropriate for the simulated skin model.

Summary
The video documents a disciplined, stepwise closure of a single left‑sided linear incision using sequential simple interrupted sutures. The operator maintains a compact working triangle, uses forceps to evert tissue and a needle driver to deliver controlled arcs through dermal tissue, and progresses stitch by stitch along the length of the incision. Hand positions translate along the wound as the row advances, with occasional minor variations in needle grip and isolated moments of suture management or single-handed tying, but with consistent technique and successful final approximation of the wound margins. Any brief frames that hint at continuous suture motion or less optimal needle grips are transient; they do not change the overall interrupted‑suture pattern nor the quality of the completed closure.
