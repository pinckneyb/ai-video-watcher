COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel, vertical incisions. The operator uses a simple interrupted suturing technique with instrument ties and alternates between a needle driver, Adson/rat-tooth forceps for tissue control, and suture scissors for trimming. Across the session, the work consolidates on the vertical slit located furthest to the right, progressively closing it from its lower portion toward its superior end with a short, orderly row of interrupted stitches. Knot placement is consistently managed with instrument ties, and tails are cut to manageable length as each stitch is completed.

At the outset there is a brief, isolated needle pass at the superior half of the leftmost incision. The needle is held in the driver at the proximal third to midpoint, delivered perpendicular to the surface, and passed in a controlled arc while the opposite edge is presented with pickups. No knot is tied during this early moment, and no further work continues on this left-sided slit; the rest of the session is devoted exclusively to the rightmost incision. By the end of the case, only the right-hand wound shows placed sutures, indicating that the initial exploratory pass on the left was not developed into a stitch.

The definitive closure begins on the rightmost vertical slit. The operator positions the left hand with a needle driver over this wound while the right hand uses Adson forceps to stabilize and evert the wound edges. The needle is grasped one-third from the swaged end, oriented almost perfectly perpendicular to the skin, and driven with a smooth rotational motion that follows the curvature of the needle through the first edge and across to the opposing side. The target is a small, symmetric bite across the lower third of the slit, laying the foundation for the first stitch in this series. The thread trails from the needle across the wound, and at this stage no knot is tied; the emphasis is on precise placement and consistent depth on both sides.

Working in the same area, the left hand keeps the driver in a stable, slightly superior position while the right hand continues to facilitate exposure. The forceps evert the near edge for entry, then move to steady the far edge for exit. With the needle grasped at the proximal-to-mid body, the driver pronates to complete a smooth pass across the incision at the inferior end. The operator regrips as necessary to finish the arc and pull the suture through, setting up for tying and suggesting an intent to anchor the first stitch at the bottom of the wound. Scissors are brought near in anticipation of trimming after tying, though trimming will wait until the knot is secured.

At mid-wound, the right hand now assumes control of the needle driver while the left alternates between pickups for edge stabilization and holding the free suture end. The needle, grasped about two-thirds from the tip, is passed right-to-left in symmetrical fashion, and the operator immediately transitions to instrument ties. The driver crosses over the wound to form the first throw while the left hand maintains steady counter-tension. Successive throws are delivered with deliberate, alternating direction to lock the knot securely, seating it precisely over the wound line. The knot rests on the lateral side of the incision, consistent with the operator’s handling and orientation. This establishes the rhythm that will repeat throughout the rest of the closure: controlled passes, meticulous approximation, instrument ties over the wound, and eventual trimming.

A subsequent pass is taken just superior to the prior knot. The left hand again holds the driver, with the needle positioned on its proximal-to-middle third, perpendicular to the skin. The right hand manages the strand and, at times, lightly steadies the pad or the edge with fine pickups. Bites are placed a few millimeters from the margin with matched depth, then the suture is drawn through. The spacing appears consistent with the earlier stitch, and eversion is encouraged through a combination of needle trajectory and gentle counter-traction. This pass is readied for tying, maintaining the linear progression up the wound.

Continuing up the same line, the forceps briefly engage to evert and steady the dermal margin near an existing knot. The needle is held at the proximal third in the driver, once again perpendicular, and is advanced cleanly through one lip and directed toward the opposite side with evenly matched bite sizes. The technique shows minimal trauma: just enough purchase to ensure reliable approximation without strangulating the tissue. This pass establishes another stitch site further superior and slightly lateral to ensure proper alignment and consistent spacing.

With several passes now set along the inferior to mid portions of the wound, the operator transitions to knot tying. The left hand holds the driver centered over the right-hand slit while the right hand alternates between Adson forceps and scissors. The free end is manipulated into loops, multiple throws are placed, and the knot is cinched as the forceps briefly steady the wound edge to prevent displacement and help seat the knot flush with the epidermal plane. Once the knot is confirmed stable, the scissors advance to trim the tails to an appropriate length. The needle remains out of tissue during these tying moments—secured in the driver while the knot is seated and then lifted away cleanly when done. This sequence completes one of the stitches that had been previously passed without a tie, formalizing it into the growing row.

Shortly after, the right hand takes up the needle driver and completes another stitch just inferior to an existing knot, consistent with filling in the immediate vicinity to ensure there are no gaps. The left hand alternates between pickups and holding the tail. The needle is oriented perpendicular, and after the pass the instrument ties are executed directly over the wound edge so the knot nests beside the earlier one. The driver crosses the wound line in a controlled manner, the left hand providing counter-traction to keep the knot centered and seated. This repeats the same deliberate tying pattern, producing a tidy stack of knots aligned along the lateral side.

A new stitch is then secured mid-to-lower on the slit with the right hand on the needle holder and the left helping to guide and stabilize with forceps or a second driver. The needle remains in the driver during tying, indicating a preference to maintain control of the curved needle while manipulating the free end. Edge eversion is maintained with gentle traction rather than aggressive grasping. Once the knot is seated, both hands withdraw slightly from the field, leaving the stitch properly tightened and aligned with the others.

Work proceeds to the upper portion of the rightmost slit. The left hand now holds the needle driver throughout the pass and tying, while the right hand uses tissue pickups to evert the left lip of the wound and then the right. The needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip and positioned just lateral to the left wound edge near the superior end of the slit. The bite sequence is balanced—small, symmetric entries on each side. After the suture is drawn through, instrument ties secure the knot down over the wound and the edges come together with no gapping or inversion.

The operator continues to tie a newly placed stitch at the superior portion above the previously placed knots. The right hand adopts the needle driver while the left hand controls the free end and occasionally stabilizes tissue. Multiple instrument-tie throws are performed, cinching the knot directly at the wound edge. The hands cross over the incision during throws, then separate to seat the knot. No tails are cut immediately in this segment, reflecting a focus on locking the knot before trimming.

Now working just superior to the earlier stitches, the left hand resumes holding the driver with the right hand using forceps only briefly to steady edges or manage the needle. The pass proceeds in a forehand right-to-left motion, maintaining a perpendicular needle orientation. The suture is drawn through and instrument ties are used to lock the knot, with final frames in this sequence suggesting preparation to cut the tails. Through these actions, the spacing of stitches up the wound remains even, and slight eversion is preserved.

Next, the left hand continues to control the driver while the right hand lifts and everts the right-hand wound edge with pickups to present tissue thickness for the entry bite. The needle is positioned right at the epidermal margin for a full-thickness purchase across to the other side, in line with the previously placed series. This segment shows the beginning of the next pass as the closure advances superiorly. The bites are consistent, and the instruments oppose each other across the wound to preserve visibility and control.

A stitch in this superior zone is then completed and tied. The left hand holds the needle driver high over the wound while the right hand alternates between Adson forceps and suture scissors. After securing the knot with instrument ties, the tails are cut to length. The new knot rests just above the earlier series, stepping the closure further up the wound while maintaining uniform spacing and tension.

In the following sequence, the right hand predominantly holds the needle driver, while the left hand manages the free end and even presents scissors as needed. Notably, no tissue forceps are used here; instead, edge eversion and approximation are achieved by the geometry of the needle pass and counter-traction on the suture alone. The needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip and driven perpendicularly in a controlled arc. After passage, instrument ties are performed with the left hand stabilizing the tail, continuing the same pattern of secure knot construction directly over the wound edges.

At the upper third of the incision, the left hand holds the driver while the right hand uses forceps primarily to grasp the needle for extraction as it exits the superior bite. Tissue handling is minimal; the focus is on maintaining orientation and control of the needle as it is delivered from the tissue. After the needle is safely retrieved, both instruments move away to the right, leaving the newly placed pass undisturbed—ready for tying, or completing a stitch that had just been secured.

There is a brief interval of instrument presence where the left hand appears over the upper-left quadrant with the needle driver while the right hand, holding forceps, makes only minimal, superficial contact with the right-side wound edge. No new pass is made and no knot is tied during these moments; it reads as a retrieval and repositioning step. Both instruments are then withdrawn together, parallel to the wound, with no change to the sutures already in place.

The session concludes with a still view of the field. The right-side incision shows a short run of simple interrupted stitches spanning from its inferior portion up toward the superior end. The knots lie consistently on the lateral (patient’s right) side of the wound, and the tails extend outward in a uniform fashion. The edges are approximated with mild eversion and without conspicuous gapping. The other two slits to the left are untouched at this stage, underscoring that all definitive closure occurred exclusively on the rightmost wound.

Across the procedure, hand dominance and roles alternate, reflecting a flexible, practiced technique. At different points, either hand controls the needle driver: early on the left hand drives the needle with the right hand using forceps; later, the right hand assumes the driver while the left manages the free end or assists with pickups; and then the left again takes over driver duties for subsequent passes and ties. Throughout, the driver is kept perpendicular to the skin to optimize the path of the curved needle, which is usually grasped at the proximal third to mid-body for a balance of torque and control. When regripping is required to follow the arc, the transition is smooth, and the passes are completed without undue tissue shearing.

Tissue handling emphasizes gentle eversion and precise, symmetric bites. When forceps are used, they engage the dermal edge lightly to present tissue thickness and align the entry and exit points. On occasion, notably in one of the upper stitches, the operator dispenses with pickups and relies on needle trajectory and suture counter-traction to achieve eversion and approximation, demonstrating adaptable technique. Knot tying is consistently performed as instrument ties with the knot seated down to the wound edge, typically on the lateral side. Throws are deliberate and alternating, and the knots are cinched with the instruments crossing the wound and then separating to tighten. Tails are trimmed to appropriate length after knot security is confirmed.

By the end, the rightmost incision has been closed with a tidy sequence of simple interrupted stitches extending from the lower third upward, leaving the wound well-approximated with mild, desirable eversion and no evident inversion or over-tightening. The spacing between stitches is consistent and the depth of bites appears matched on both sides of the incision, supporting good alignment. The needle is under control at all times—parked safely during tying and lifted free when not in use. The overall closure is clean and methodical, with knots evenly stacked along one side and trimmed neatly. The other incisions are left unaltered, and the final view confirms the exclusive, completed work on the right-hand slit, producing a stable, aesthetically aligned closure consistent with careful simple interrupted technique.
