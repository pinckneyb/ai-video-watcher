COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a synthetic skin pad with three linear incisions; all attention is on the central wound. The surgeon establishes a steady, opposing-hands setup: left hand with Adson forceps to evert and control the dermal edge, right hand with a needle driver to deliver the needle. The needle is loaded at the proximal third to mid-body and presented perpendicular to the skin for precise, atraumatic entry.

0–14 s
The first pass is taken on the central incision. With the forceps lifting the left lip to evert the dermis, the right hand drives the needle from the patient’s right edge toward the left, rotating the wrist to let the needle follow its curve cleanly through the dermis. The driver releases and regrips to retrieve the needle on the far side, keeping bites symmetric and a few millimeters from the edge. The suture is drawn through with enough slack to avoid drag; no tying is performed yet.

15–29 s
The next sequence shows another pass on the central wound, this time entering at 90 degrees on the left edge and exiting the right—mirroring the earlier bite and maintaining the same disciplined needle loading and wrist rotation. Once the needle is through, the driver releases and regrips to deliver the strand, then parks the needle off to the side to transition into knot tying. The choreography changes: the right hand (driver) now becomes a knot pusher and loop passer, the left hand alternates between the forceps (to evert or steady the near edge) and managing the long standing end of the suture. Instrument ties are thrown in alternating directions. The driver reaches through each loop to pick up the short tail, guides the throw down, and tensions symmetrically so the knot seats centrally over the incision with gentle edge eversion and precise coaptation.

30–44 s
Attention narrows to seating and trimming the knot. The right hand briefly uses the needle holder to snug the knot, then trades for scissors. The left hand controls the long free end to counteract tension while the short tail is trimmed close to the epidermis. Scissor blades are oriented nearly parallel to the skin to avoid snagging tissue. With the knot secure and tidy, the instruments lift off; the left hand’s forceps drift toward the next target site along the incision, signaling progression.

45–59 s
Knot security is reinforced with additional alternating instrument throws. The loop is formed around the driver, which reaches through to seize the short end and deliver each throw squarely. The left forceps intermittently release and re-engage the near edge to maintain approximation without crushing. The standing part is kept lateral/inferior while the short tail is managed on the superior/right side—consistent, repeatable hand mechanics that keep the knot centered and flat. After the final throw, scissors return to cut the tails; the right hand gives a final lateral tension check on the standing strand to confirm the knot lies snugly without strangulating tissue.

60–74 s
A brief interlude focuses on securing a small central bite whose needle has been parked. The left index finger posts the long strand while the right hand uses the driver to pull the short end through instrument ties, advancing the knot smoothly down to the surface. Scissors arrive from the right to trim the short tail neatly at the knot. The wound edges remain gently everted; no new tissue passes occur here—just precise knot setting and housekeeping.

75–89 s
The surgeon moves to the lower portion of the central incision. The needle is reloaded correctly—held about two-thirds from the tip, perpendicular to the jaws, curve oriented to follow a natural arc. The right hand drives the needle from the patient’s right edge of the lower short incision toward the left. As the tip emerges, the driver regrips near the needle tip to complete the passage. The left forceps lift and evert the left edge to present the dermis for a clean exit, keeping bites symmetric and dermal. The suture is drawn through to an appropriate working length, ready for tying.

90–104 s
Tying begins on this lower stitch. The needle remains out of the field while the right hand uses the driver as a loop passer and knot pusher. The left hand alternates between fingers and forceps to control the free end a safe distance from the knot, avoiding entanglement with the superior stitches. Alternating throws are laid flat and tightened in opposite directions, with steady, even traction to center the knot over the wound and bring the edges together without crush.

105–119 s
The right hand alternates deftly between the driver and scissors—first snugging the long strand to seat the knot, then trimming the tails with blades parallel to the skin. The left hand transitions to the forceps again, briefly grasping the inferior lip to set up the next bite. The lower portion of the incision is now approximated beneath the previously placed sutures; the working field remains orderly with short tails and centered knots.

120–134 s
Work continues along the inferior edge of the central incision. The needle is again grasped at the proximal third to midpoint, presented near perpendicular, and driven through the right side across to the opposite edge. The driver regrips as needed to complete the pass, drawing the suture through and leaving a short tail on the patient’s right. A blue-handled instrument—likely scissors—briefly enters, then withdraws as the team prepares to tie or trim.

135–146 s
Final touches at the inferior knot. No needle is visible now. The right hand uses the driver to tension and control the free suture end, then swaps to scissors entering from the right/lower edge to cut the tail. The left hand’s forceps hover over the knot to present the strand for a clean cut. The central incision is closed with three evenly spaced, simple interrupted sutures—knots centered, tails short, and the epidermal margins gently everted. The two lateral slits remain untouched throughout, and the instruments consistently stay close to the field, moving in a measured cadence.

Overall rhythm and technique
Across the sequence, the surgeon maintains a disciplined pattern: precise needle loading and perpendicular entry; wrist rotation to follow the needle’s curve; forceps used to evert, not crush; symmetric dermal bites; and a deliberate pause to park the needle before tying. Instrument ties are thrown in alternating directions to square each knot, with the driver guiding loops down and balanced tension applied from both ends to center the knot over the wound. Scissors approach with blades nearly parallel to the skin to trim tails short. The hands oppose each other predictably across the incision, rarely crossing, which keeps the field clear, the suture untangled, and the closure neat. By the end, the central wound is coapted with slight, uniform eversion and tidy knots—an unhurried, methodical close executed through repeated, precise movements.
