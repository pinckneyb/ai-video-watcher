COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a quiet field: a synthetic skin pad with several vertical slits, no hands in view. As the sequence begins (0–14 s), the right hand enters with a gold‑handled needle driver holding a curved needle, and the left hand brings in tissue forceps. Working in the lower‑left quadrant, the left hand lightly stabilizes and everts the near wound edge while the right hand aligns the needle perpendicular to the skin, tip poised at the entry point. The suture trails freely without tension. Full penetration isn’t shown yet; the setup is precise and deliberate.

Almost immediately, the focus shifts from needle placement to knot security on a stitch that has already been passed (15–44 s). The needle is set aside, and the work becomes an instrument‑tie demonstration over the lower‑left incision. The left hand takes over the needle driver as the tying instrument while the right hand manages the long limb. The right wraps the standing strand around the driver, the left hand captures the short tail, and each throw is slid down with horizontal tension across the wound. Throws alternate direction to square the knot, the motion compact and close to the skin so the knot lands centrally without twisting the edges.

That rhythm continues (45–74 s). The needle remains parked off to the right on the long limb while the operator alternates between hand ties and instrument ties to build and seat a secure knot. A driver reappears from the superior‑left briefly to act as a post, helping the throws travel neatly down the strands. A second ringed instrument hovers at the left field as a stationary reference, but no forceps engage the tissue; approximation is achieved by balanced tension alone. The final throw in this block settles the suture flat across the pad, the knot centered over the small lower‑left slit.

With the foundational knot seated (75–104 s), the left hand continues using the needle driver purely as a tying tool, while the right hand alternates tension between the long and short limbs to advance successive throws. The curved needle stays out of harm’s way, lying free on the pad attached to the long strand. At moments the right hand introduces pickup forceps just to tension the tail before releasing them again. The knot firms up over the entry/exit sites, and by the end of this sequence the stitch lies undisturbed, confirming a secure, square construct.

The next phase is a transition to set up another pass (105–134 s). The right hand picks up tissue forceps in a pencil grip, finds the needle near the lower‑left site, and repositions it, grasping on the mid‑to‑distal body to align the curvature. The left‑hand needle driver closes on the needle at the mid‑distal third, establishing a stable hold with the arc oriented for an orthogonal approach to the skin. The right hand then releases the forceps and sweeps the suture laterally to the right, clearing the working space. With the needle now secure in the driver and aimed toward a more central/right vertical incision, the stage is set for the next bite. Before moving on, there’s brief housekeeping (135–149 s): the right hand tags the short suture end with a clamp to act as a post, and the left hand switches to scissors to trim close to a completed knot on the left incision. The needle remains controlled and out of the wound while these finishing steps are done.

A new bite is taken (150–164 s). The right hand drives the needle from the right side while the left hand, now holding tissue forceps, gently elevates the near edge of a superior central slit. The needle follows its curve cleanly through the near and then the far side. The driver releases and regrips as needed to complete passage, and the suture is drawn through, laying a free length across the field toward the right. No knot is tied in this moment; it’s a deliberate, single pass with minimal force on the edges—just enough stabilization for accurate placement.

The video then returns to tying sequences over the left incision line (165–194 s). The curved needle is again left parked on the right, and the instrument work becomes compact and controlled above the wound. The right hand, now dominant with the needle driver, repeatedly grasps the short tail. The left hand posts and pulls the long end inferior‑laterally to set each throw. Wraps are made around the shaft of the driver, direction alternates to square the knot, and each throw is walked down so the knot remains centered, parallel to the incision. The left‑hand driver occasionally acts as a stabilizing post near the knot site, while the right hand forms large loops and advances them. Throughout, the suture line runs from the knot toward the resting needle on the right, and the instruments avoid crossing directly over the wound.

In the final segment (195–208 s), the right hand applies a last snugging traction on the free limb to seat the most recent throw, while the left hand briefly introduces tissue forceps from the upper‑left as light stabilization adjacent to the stitch line. No cutting or new bites occur here. After the final tensioning, both hands leave the field. The camera lingers on a neat short run of interrupted stitches approximating the left‑of‑center incision, with suture tails trimmed and lying clear. A separate central‑right incision remains open, illustrating the stepwise, interrupted nature of the exercise.

Across the full sequence, the technique evolves logically: initial setup and edge control; careful, alternating instrument ties to secure early stitches; safe needle parking during knot construction; reloading and orientation of the needle for the next pass; trimming of completed knots; a precise new tissue bite with controlled regrasping; and a return to measured knot‑tying to finish. The hands work in small, economical arcs just above the skin, tensioning horizontally to avoid edge inversion. The rhythm is consistent—wrap, grasp, slide, set; reset the field; repeat—showcasing sound fundamentals of interrupted suturing on a synthetic pad.
