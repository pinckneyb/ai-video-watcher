COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire sequence documents work on the vertical incision located at the far right edge of the synthetic skin pad. From the first substantive working frames through the final static frames, the operator returns repeatedly to that same lateral slit, advancing closure from its lower and mid portions upward toward the superior end. Throughout the procedure two-handed technique is used with a needle driver and tissue forceps alternating roles between hands as needed; instrument orientation, needle grasp points, and tissue handling are consistent with deliberate, small-bite closure intended to approximate and slightly evert the dermal margins.

Initial setup and early passes (0.0–74.0 s)
The recording opens with a brief period during which the central area of the pad is obscured by a paper label, leaving the field unworked and no instruments engaged. Once working frames begin, the operator concentrates on the rightmost vertical slit adjacent to the “Station 3” area. Hands enter primarily from the left and upper-right aspects of the frame. The left hand commonly carries a needle driver (notably a gold-handled instrument in many frames), and the right hand alternates between Adson/Brown-style tissue forceps and another needle driver or scissors for suture management.

Needle control is established early: the curved needle is repeatedly grasped along its proximal to mid‑shaft (proximal third to midpoint in many observations) and oriented roughly perpendicular to the skin surface prior to entry. The right-side tissue edge is presented with forceps so that each bite enters near the epidermal margin, traverses the gap, and exits at a matching depth on the opposing edge. Bites are placed with short, controlled arcs and frequent regrips along the needle body to produce an orthogonal, symmetric purchase of both wound lips. Suture tails and the long running strand are kept to the right of the working field to avoid entanglement with the neighboring incisions.

Progress through the lower and mid segments (75.0–179.0 s)
Across this middle early period the operator repeatedly places fresh passes along the same lateral slit, advancing from the lower third toward the mid and lower–mid regions. Hand positions remain largely consistent: a driver approaches from the left/medial side while forceps operate to the right/lateral aspect of the slit; occasionally these roles are reversed depending on the reach and the bite being taken.

Needle technique is steady. The driver commonly seizes the needle near the proximal-third of the curve, then rotates and regrips nearer the tip as the arc completes to extract and pull the suture through. Forceps gently evert and stabilize the dermal edge; bites are taken a few millimeters from the margin with care to approximate without strangulation. Movements are short and precise—drivers and forceps cross briefly over the wound at an angle of approximately 60–90 degrees during passage, then separate to clear the suture loop. On several occasions scissors are used briefly to trim knot tails immediately after tying, demonstrating progression from bite placement to knot work within the same working segment.

During this interval there is evidence of both interrupted-stitch maneuvers (instrument ties, trimming of short tails adjacent to individual bites) and sequences that resemble a running approach (a strand that arcs superiorly along the line and successive bites continuing the line). These observations reflect a practical, situational approach: the operator places sequential bites along the right slit and alternates between tying individual throws and managing a continuous strand to advance closure. Some frames explicitly show instrument ties being thrown with the needle driver while the forceps secure the short tail.

Mid-course consolidation and methodical advancement (180.0–269.0 s)
As the procedure proceeds, the operator focuses on the mid-to-upper segments of the same lateral juncture. Hand positions evolve subtly to accommodate working progressively superior. The needle driver alternates sides of approach—sometimes working from the patient’s right toward the left, sometimes entering from the left side—while the opposing hand consistently elevates and everts the targeted wound lip. Frequently the left hand assumes driving responsibilities and the right hand stabilizes tissue with forceps; in other moments the dominant hand changes to facilitate better ergonomics for bite alignment.

Needle handling becomes rhythmic: the surgeon regrips the needle as necessary to maintain perpendicular entry, often repositioning the grasp a fraction of the curve to follow the arc without impinging on adjacent sutures. Tissue handling remains atraumatic—forceps contact is limited to the dermal edge and purposeful tenting is used to expose bite points. After each pass the suture is pulled through snugly to seat the throw with slight eversion of the margins, and knots are formed or instrument ties initiated on several passes. The suture loop and long strand are kept lateral to the wound and periodically reorganized with instruments so that subsequent bites can be taken without entanglement.

During these middle frames the narrative is one of methodically stepping the closure upward. The operator alternates between passes that look like interrupted stitches—with instrument ties and tail trimming—and sequences where the strand is left long and successive bites proceed cranially along the slit. This mixed use is pragmatic: maintaining edge approximation, securing each portion before advancing and minimizing slack between throws.

Approach to the superior end and tying activity (270.0–359.0 s)
As work reaches the upper portion of the right incision, the choreography of hands tightens. The two instruments form a tight working triangle centered on the superior bite site. The forceps tent the dermal edge immediately lateral to the planned entry while the driver approaches from above-right or left-of-center, depending on which bite is being taken. Needle grasp points shift slightly—occasionally two-thirds from the tip—to help deliver the tip cleanly through the dermis and out the opposite edge. After passage the driver is frequently exchanged for scissors or the second instrument to manage the tail and begin instrument ties.

Several frames in this segment document explicit tying and trimming activity near the top of the line: the forceps secures the short tail while the needle driver executes instrument ties, and scissors appear poised to trim tails after throws are completed. The operator forms loops and seats throws deliberately, drawing the knots down to approximate the edges with slight eversion. Instrument crossing is minimized; hands remain opposed but coordinated, passing the needle and manipulating the suture with minimal tissue crush.

There is nuance in technique here: some frames show the operator performing what appears to be instrument ties on individual stitches (a more interrupted approach), while other images depict a running strand being tightened and seated at the superior end (consistent with a continuous finishing pass). These coexisting maneuvers suggest that the operator secures segments as needed—finishing a short series of running bites with a securing throw or placing isolated interrupted knots where tension or tissue feel requires it.

Finishing maneuvers and final adjustments (360.0–390.0 s)
In the late frames, attention concentrates at the superior-most portion of the incision. The left or right hand may briefly take on forceps or scissors to adjust tails while the driver re-enters with a needle or to perform final instrument ties. Loops are formed and tightened; prior throws are seated. At one point the scene pauses with both hands momentarily out of frame, leaving a static view of the right slit showing multiple closely spaced bites, mild edge puckering, and a free strand lying laterally on the table.

Throughout this last stage the operator’s maneuvers aim to bring the wound edges into close apposition with slight eversion and without excessive tension. The suture path has been managed to avoid catching adjacent cuts; the adjoining central and left vertical slits are not manipulated during this sequence. The final visible configuration shows the slit predominantly approximated across its length with a more definitive focus at the superior end where loops have been tightened and knot throws completed or in the process of being completed. However, the last frame captures a brief pause with no hands in view, and a small portion near the very superior tip remains slightly open on the static image—indicating either that the final securing throw has just been completed and tails await trimming, or that a last superficial adjustment is pending.

Technique evolution and consistency
Across the entire episode the technique is fundamentally consistent: controlled perpendicular bites taken near the wound margin, forceps-enabled eversion of the dermal lip, and careful needle arrest/regrasping to follow the natural curve without distorting tissue. The operator demonstrates reliable control of needle orientation, using proximal or mid-curve grasps to effect predictable arcs and then regripping nearer the tip to extract the needle after passage.

There is pragmatic variability in how the operator secures the suture line: individual instrument ties, trimming of tails, and occasional appearance of a running strand all occur. This does not indicate error but rather an adaptive strategy—securing segments as required while advancing closure. At moments the line is treated like interrupted sutures with separate ties; at others a continuous progression is evident in the way successive passes are left on the same standing strand and tightened sequentially. Either way, the common goal—accurate dermal edge approximation with slight eversion and avoidance of strangulation—is maintained.

Hand positioning and spatial relationships
Hands operate in an opposing, complementary fashion throughout: one instrument approaches from the left/medial side while the other supports on the right/lateral edge. Instruments cross briefly above the wound during needle passage, generally at a controlled angle to preserve sightlines and to avoid instrument clash. As the operator advances cranially, instrument positions migrate correspondingly: approaches and retrievals shift superiorly, instrument grips alter slightly to maintain ergonomic needle arcs, and suture tails are periodically reorganized to the right of the field. Scissors intermittently enter to trim tails or to assist in knot management, then withdraw to permit continued suturing.

Final state
By the end of the recorded sequence the right lateral incision is substantially approximated along much of its length. Multiple sequential bites have been placed from the lower region up toward the superior end; loops have been tightened and constituent throws seated. The edges exhibit slight eversion and are aligned without visible gapping across most of the slit. Some suture tails have been cut, and others remain short and secured next to the knot stacks. A brief final frame shows the field quiet with hands out of view and a loose strand resting laterally, suggesting either a short pause after completion or readiness for a final trim. One small area at the extreme superior tip appears slightly less advanced than the rest of the line in that static view, indicating a pending minor finishing step at the very end.

Notes on visualization limitations
A small portion of the early recording included a paper label obscuring the central pad area, and one short interval contained a frame that visually emphasized the central incision. These moments do not reflect sustained deviation from the right slit as the operative focus; instead they represent transient framing or occlusion. Likewise, the mixture of interrupted and running appearance in different frames reflects practical, local decision-making rather than inconsistency in basic suturing skill.

Overall, the procedure shows a deliberate, controlled suturing strategy focused on the rightmost vertical incision: careful needle management, consistent tissue presentation with forceps, methodical progression cranially along the slit, and securement of bites through instrument tying and occasional trimming—resulting in an effectively approximated wound with slight eversion and only minor residual work at the extreme superior margin.
