COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone skin pad with multiple parallel vertical incisions, but only one wound is actually taken from mid-course through to a completed closure: the short vertical incision situated on the right side of the pad. The field often includes other marked incisions, and at several points the operator positions the needle over those adjacent cuts, reloads the needle, or rehearses an entry angle across them. However, those moments do not lead to tied or retained stitches on those other lines. The closure that consistently advances—bite after bite, with knots set and tails cut—is the right‑sided vertical wound. What follows is a chronological account of that single closure and the technique that carries it to completion, noting where the camera or hands stray briefly over neighboring incisions without altering the course of the main repair.

The session begins with instrument setup and calibration of needle control over the central region of the pad. The left hand holds a needle driver while the right hand uses forceps to evert a wound edge and present tissue for a clean entry at the lower end of a central incision. The needle is gripped near the proximal third to mid‑body and oriented almost perpendicular to the skin, aligning with the intended arc across the cut. This early segment serves as a positioning exercise: edges are lifted, an entry site is chosen at an appropriate margin, and the needle tip is brought to the edge in a controlled manner. No tying occurs here, and nothing in this opening sequence commits to a closure on that midline cut; the right‑sided wound, with a pre‑existing series of stitches from earlier work, sits unused in the background.

The operator then transitions the right hand to the needle driver and the left hand to pickups over the central vertical wound to rehearse the same fundamentals: small, orthogonal entries, the needle grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, and a smooth wrist‑driven arc. Forceps gently lift the dermal edge for eversion, and the driver advances the needle tip tip‑to‑tip with the opposing instrument. Suture is drawn through and managed out of the working corridor without tying a knot, again emphasizing controlled passage and depth. A similar sequence follows on the incision just right of center, where the needle is aligned to enter the near right edge at the lower third. The left forceps elevate the edge to present robust dermis for the bite. Still, these passes remain preparatory; none of these central or paracentral actions result in knots or cut tails. They function as calibration steps before attention moves decisively to the target wound on the right.

With the preparatory positioning complete, the operator commits to the right‑sided vertical incision. Here, a contiguous row of stitches is already present, and the work proceeds from the mid‑portion toward the superior end. The right hand carries the needle driver over the right edge of the wound, the left hand opposing with forceps or a second driver to stabilize tissue and help guide the needle through the arc. The needle is held at the proximal third to mid‑body, perpendicular to the skin. Each pass conforms to the curvature, minimizing tissue trauma and promoting subtle eversion. Bites are symmetric across the incision, and the suture is tensioned to draw the edges into precise approximation without blanching.

At times the camera returns to the central incision, showing reloading of the needle, instrument exchanges, or even a demonstrative pass across the midline with the driver held at two‑thirds from the needle tip. The forceps evert the edge, and the needle crosses, but no knot is placed. These interludes do not interrupt the cadence of the closure on the right; rather, they coincide with brief pauses between stitches on the main wound, allowing the operator to adjust needle loading or check ergonomics before resuming the definitive repair.

Back at the right wound’s inferior segment, the operator tightens and secures a stitch with the needle driver and assisting instrument. The left hand briefly switches to scissors while the right hand maintains the driver, and the tails of the just‑secured stitch are trimmed. This establishes the pattern that will recur: pass, retrieve, draw down, tie, cut, and then advance proximally to the next bite. The suture line is kept free of entanglement, with the free strand lifted superiorly and laterally when not in use.

Moving up the incision, the right hand, still on the needle driver, places the next stitch contiguous to the existing series. The left hand again alternates between forceps for tissue control and a second driver for instrument ties. Each bite is delivered orthogonally to the wound, with consistent depth and bite width that match the spacing of the earlier stitches. Forceps grasp the dermal edge lightly to evert; the needle advances in a smooth curvilinear path; the suture is drawn through with small, efficient motions that keep the working zone compact and aligned with the wound axis.

A brief detour occurs as the operator trims tails on previous knots and then repositions over the midline incision to rehearse the next entry angle. The left hand takes the needle driver above and to the left of the midline wound while the right hand steadies the opposite margin with toothed forceps. Again, the needle is loaded two‑thirds from the tip, arc perpendicular, tip poised for a precise entry. No tying is performed here, and the operator quickly returns to the right‑sided incision to continue the true closure.

At mid‑portion of the right wound, a new pass is taken with the needle grasped one‑third from the swage, advanced across the gap, and secured. Edges remain evenly approximated by the preceding stitches, which helps the operator maintain consistent depth and spacing. The left instrument supports gentle countertraction, elevating the near edge without crushing. The driver regrips as needed to complete the arc and deliver the needle out the far side. Suture is drawn through, and a snug knot is set with controlled downward pressure that preserves eversion.

The sequence repeats along the superior half of the wound. The right hand maintains primary control of the needle driver; the left hand alternates between pickups for tissue and a driver for ties. The operator keeps hands opposed across the incision, forming a small working triangle over the wound. The needle is consistently loaded at the proximal third to mid‑curve, perpendicular to the surface, and it advances with smooth wrist rotation. The suture is pulled through and tensioned parallel to the wound axis, and the knot is laid down cleanly. The suture tail is oriented away from the field and trimmed to a tidy length before the next stitch is begun.

In the mid‑to‑upper third, the operator takes another bite with the same principles. The left hand everts the wound edges in turn, the right hand drives and retrieves, then ties the stitch. Instrument ties are used at first; later, as the operator works closer to the apex where space is tighter, the technique alternates to finger ties over the incision. The transition is seamless: after a pass at the superior portion, both instruments are briefly set down, and the hands execute multiple throws directly on the suture to secure the knot before re‑grasping instruments to proceed. Throughout, the suture strand is managed so it does not drape across other incisions, and both hands keep their tips within a few millimeters of the wound to maintain control.

At the upper end of the right incision, work continues in short, efficient cycles. The right hand holds the driver and the left hand either pickups or a second driver; forceps occasionally assist the needle tip as it emerges to regrip and reorient for the next pass. The needle remains perpendicular to the wound line and is driven with a consistent arc that matches earlier bites, preserving uniformity in spacing and depth. After passage and retrieval, the operator draws the suture through, seats the stitch just adjacent to the previous knot, and secures it. A pair of scissors then enters from the left to trim tails, and the instruments withdraw briefly to clear the field.

The operator intermittently repositions over the central incision to reload the needle or test the grip and angle. One of these interludes shows the needle driver with a distinctive red ring on the handle, further highlighting instrument identity and control, but again, no knot is tied on the central or left incisions and no stitch remains there. These moments are notable for technique rehearsal—forceps lift an edge, the driver approaches perpendicular, a controlled arc is initiated—but they do not change the course of the main repair. Suture placement, tying, and cutting continue exclusively on the right wound.

As the closure nears completion, the surgeon addresses the superior end of the right incision with particular care. The left hand steadies the tissue and manages the free limb, maintaining gentle tension to prevent looping or snagging. The right hand executes the pass and then pulls the suture through in a line that is parallel to the wound. The hands cross briefly over the incision to set the knot, and then they diverge to lay the knot down centered over the wound axis. Another pass follows at the very top of the line; after the needle is delivered, a finger‑tie secures the throw, and the scissors return to cut the tails. Each additional stitch seats snugly against the previous one, continuing the row toward the apex with even spacing and consistent eversion.

Immediately after these top‑end stitches are tied, the operator briefly stages the needle over a left‑sided cut, organizing the working strand and regrasping the needle two‑thirds from its tip for the next pass. No tissue is penetrated in these frames, and the action returns to the right side where the final interrupted stitches are placed, tied, and their tails trimmed. The last of these shows bimanual coordination around the upper third of the right incision: the left hand alternates between a driver and scissors, the right hand alternates between forceps and the driver to control the needle tip, and instruments cross over the wound as needed for retrieval and knot tying. The knot is snugged carefully, excess is trimmed, and the row presents as neatly ordered, with each knot centered and each bite symmetric.

With the definitive closure complete, the final images show a quiet field. The needle driver rests to the left on the blue drape, and no hands are manipulating tissue. The right‑sided vertical incision lies along the lateral margin of the pad with a series of closely spaced stitches that bring the edges together evenly. Tails are short and directed laterally; the line is characterized by uniform bite width and depth, gentle eversion, and knots seated consistently over the incision. Other incisions on the pad—the central and left lines with alignment marks—remain open in these closing frames, emphasizing that no closure was carried through on them in this sequence. The suture strands that trail from the right‑sided stitch line confirm recent work there, while the clear working zone and absence of instruments underscore completion.

Across the procedure, the technique remains methodical and consistent. The needle is routinely grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body, aligned perpendicular to the skin, and driven with controlled wrist rotation that respects the curvature. The left hand provides countertraction and eversion with forceps or supports knot tying with a second driver; ties are alternately instrument‑ and finger‑based depending on access and stitch location. Suture management is conscientious: the free limb is kept out of the wound, tension is applied in line with the incision, and tails are trimmed promptly after each secure knot. The operator advances from mid‑incision toward the superior end, tightening each stitch as it is placed and maintaining the same spacing as earlier stitches so that the finished row is cohesive and cosmetically uniform.

Although several intervals show the needle being oriented over other incisions—central or midline‑left—these are brief setup or rehearsal moments without tied knots or cut tails. They neither add to nor subtract from the closure that proceeds and concludes on the right. Ultimately, the right‑sided wound is fully approximated with a tidy series of stitches, the field is clean, and instruments are set aside, marking the end of the repair.
