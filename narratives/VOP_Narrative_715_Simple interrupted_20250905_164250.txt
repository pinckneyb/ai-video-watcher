COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a quiet field. For the first few seconds (0–14 s) the suturing pad sits undisturbed, four vertical slits visible, a loose strand of suture resting at the lower-left. The operator leans in and briefly occludes the view, but there is no instrument work yet.

Work begins at the far‑right incision. From 15–29 s, the left hand takes the needle driver, the right hand brings in fine forceps, and the first controlled bite is initiated at the distal/right end of the right‑most slit. The forceps lift and evert the right wound edge 1–2 mm off the margin while the needle is loaded at the mid‑curve and driven from a near‑perpendicular approach. The suture is then drawn across the gap. The hands oppose one another with short, economical movements—driver superior/central, forceps from the lateral/right—establishing the rhythm that will characterize the work on this wound.

From 30–44 s the operator refines the setup. The left hand maintains the needle holder, repeatedly regrasping and aligning the needle at the proximal‑to‑mid third to keep it perpendicular to the skin and oriented right‑to‑left across the incision. The right hand manages slack instead of using tissue forceps. No bite is taken in this interval; it is a sequence of precise loading, approach, withdrawal, and reload to get the angle just right.

In the next block (45–59 s), the left hand again picks up and positions the needle, then pauses; both hands briefly leave the field. When the left hand returns, the driver is oriented across the center‑right. The right hand intermittently enters from the lower right to tension the free end. Still no penetration—this is a final organizational pause—followed by a quick forearm sweep as the right hand reaches off‑field to retrieve the suture line.

The first decisive drive continues from 60–74 s. The left hand holds the needle driver; the right hand uses toothed forceps to stabilize and evert the near edge of the right‑most slit. The needle, loaded at the proximal‑to‑middle third, is advanced with wrist rotation through the near (right) edge at a perpendicular angle. There is a brief regrasp along the curve to continue the arc, preparing to traverse toward the opposite side. This is classical, controlled motion: forceps present the tissue, the driver follows the curvature.

Between 75–89 s the driver remains over the target while the right hand releases the forceps to manage the suture tail with fingertips. The left hand regrips the needle on its body, adjusting its orientation on the surface beside the incision. There is no new penetration here; instead, the operator keeps the field tidy—tensioning and clearing slack so the subsequent pass will be clean.

The next pass is completed from 90–104 s. The left hand holds the needle driver near the junction of proximal and middle thirds of the needle; the right hand controls the strand. The needle is driven starting at the right edge and follows its curve across the slit toward the left side. The left hand lifts and rotates during delivery, and the right hand pulls the suture through as the needle exits. The work stays concentrated at the right‑most wound; no forceps are used for eversion in this segment, relying instead on smooth needle control and suture traction.

With the suture across, attention turns to securing the throw (105–119 s). The driver is used instrument‑tie style: the right hand brings the free end across the driver to form loops, and the driver grasps the short end to lay down a throw. The left hand stays superior and slightly perpendicular to the slit while the right hand alternates tension on the standing part to seat the knot. No new bites are taken; this is knot work and managing strand geometry.

There is a reset from 120–134 s. The right hand takes over the needle driver, holding it vertically above the right‑most incision while the left stays off‑field. Both hands leave briefly to park instruments; then the right forearm sweeps across as tools are repositioned. When the right hand returns, the needle is loaded near the proximal‑mid shaft with its tip oriented toward the same right‑most incision, ready to approach the edge for the next stitch.

Setup for the next pass appears at 135–149 s. The left hand reenters with the needle driver over the target; the right hand brings forceps to the right wound edge, gently everting and exposing the dermal margin. The needle is held at the mid‑to‑proximal third, aligned to enter the right edge first at a near‑perpendicular angle. Several mid‑sequence frames are occluded by the operator’s head, so the exact moment of penetration is missed, but the opposing instrument positions and needle orientation indicate the bite is about to be, or is being, taken.

What follows (150–164 s) confirms progress: with the left hand still holding the needle driver and the needle secured, the right hand transitions from forceps to fingers to pull the suture across the field, clearing slack through an existing pass. The needle tip remains near the incision, its orientation adjusted but not re‑driven. The wound edges are left undisturbed; the focus is on drawing the strand through the newly placed bite.

From 165–179 s the left hand again advances the needle toward the lateral/right edge, contacting or entering the epidermis without forceps assistance. The driver hand occasionally regrips to maintain curvature alignment. As this sequence ends, the driver is set aside and scissors are picked up with the left hand while the right hand tensions the suture—an unmistakable transition into securing and preparing to trim after knot completion.

The next interval (180–194 s) stays in that finishing mode. The curved needle is not visible; the long instrument in the left hand hovers as if for knot management or impending cutting, while a pair of forceps rests idle. The right hand holds the suture tail at the far right. No tissue manipulation or new bites occur—this is consolidation, positioning, and preparing the suture for final seating.

At 195–209 s, the left hand returns with the needle driver tip‑down over the right‑most incision; the right hand holds tissue forceps near existing stitches. The operator’s head occludes much of the action in mid‑frames, but when the view clears, the left hand is still poised with the driver and the right hand is back on the suture. No clear pass is seen; rather, the right hand intermittently engages the strand near the wound, suggesting gentle tensioning and fine adjustments before tying.

From 210–224 s, roles swap again: the right hand holds the needle driver over the bite site, repeatedly adjusting the needle orientation to keep the arc perpendicular to the incision, while the left hand pulls the free suture from the lower left to remove slack. The needle tip hovers near the left edge of the slit but does not penetrate. The hands remain separated—driver at the wound, suture control off to the side—keeping the field organized.

The tie is then secured (225–239 s). The left hand now holds the driver consistently, while the right hand alternates between a brief use of forceps and direct strand control. The needle is not in the driver; instead, an instrument tie is performed at the right edge of the wound. The right hand forms loops, the driver captures the short end, and alternating tension seats the throws flush to the incision, with short, controlled motions to avoid lifting tissue. This sequence tightens and finishes another simple interrupted stitch on the right‑most slit.

A brief diversion occurs at 240–254 s. After a short pause with instruments resting, the operator enters with the left hand on the needle driver and the right hand on forceps, this time aligning over the central incision. Forceps approach the right lip to present the edge while the needle is positioned to enter the opposite lip perpendicularly. The subsequent penetration is not visible due to occlusion. Whether this was a test alignment or an intended next stitch, the visible action is a careful setup over the middle slit.

Immediately afterward (255–269 s), attention returns to the right‑most wound. The left hand again holds the needle driver superior/central; the right hand briefly touches the wound edge with forceps, then sets them aside to manage the free suture. The needle is loaded at the proximal‑to‑mid third and kept near the existing stitch line. No pass is taken here; it’s a reloading and positioning interlude followed by strand organization.

A final, crisp needle passage is seen at 270–284 s. The right hand controls the needle driver and initiates penetration at the superior end of the right‑most incision with a perpendicular approach. The driver rotates to carry the needle along its curvature; the instrument then releases and re‑clamps to continue/complete the passage. The left hand tensions the strand to draw it through and clear the field. No knot is tied in this sequence—this is the completion of another bite with efficient regrasping and controlled torque.

The procedure concludes with housekeeping (285–299 s). The left hand sets down the driver, picks up scissors, and works deliberately over the right‑most incision while the right hand stabilizes the pad and tensions the free end. The scissors are oriented to individual knots; the right hand presents each tail laterally as the left hand trims. Instruments not in use rest off to the left. This is clean, methodical trimming of suture ends along a line of completed interrupted stitches.

In the final seconds (300–303 s), the field is quiet again. A hand briefly appears at the upper left without contacting the pad. Needle holder, forceps, and scissors lie parked to the left, tips aimed toward the work area. The right‑most incision shows several simple interrupted sutures neatly in place; the other slits remain untouched. The sequence ends the way it began: organized field, instruments at rest, and a closed wound segment achieved through a cadence of precise loading, measured passes, instrument ties, and tidy cuts.
