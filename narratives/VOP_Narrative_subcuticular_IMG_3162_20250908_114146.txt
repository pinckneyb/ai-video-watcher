COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
From the first moments, the operator establishes a clean, bimanual setup over the leftmost laceration of a three-cut skin pad. The needle driver approaches from the patient’s left, the Adson forceps from the right, creating an opposing working triangle at the superior corner. The needle is loaded at the proximal-to-mid third and held orthogonal to the skin, with the suture kept out of the field.

Early passes focus on the near (left) wound edge. After initial targeting and edge presentation, the forceps lightly grasp the dermal margin 1–2 mm from the cut to evert it, and the driver advances the needle along its curve into that left lip. The needle emerges perpendicular to the surface; the driver maintains control while the suture is pulled through in a measured fashion. Slack is cleared diagonally toward the upper right, leaving a short tail at the entry/exit site. Between these passages, the operator momentarily withdraws to reload the needle and manage the strand, using the driver tips to tension the suture near the exit without crowding the wound.

Through the mid–first minute, the same disciplined pattern repeats at the lower portion of that short left incision: right-hand Adsons pick up dermis just back from the edge to evert and stabilize, the left-hand needle holder presents the needle perpendicular to the skin, and a precise external-to-internal near-edge bite is initiated. There is no crush, no deep purchase—just controlled dermal engagement and careful pull-through while the suture is kept clear of the central field.

With the needle parked, the operator transitions into knot work over that left corner. Using an instrument tie, the needle holder serves as the working instrument: loops are formed on the long strand, the short tail is grasped and advanced, and sequential throws are laid down and tightened. The right hand manages the long limb under steady counter-tension drawn obliquely across the pad, while the left alternates the direction of throws to square the knot. The knot is seated snugly down onto the tissue at the left margin, directly adjacent to the incision but without compressing the pad.

A second cycle follows. The forceps again evert the near dermal edge at the upper-left apex, and the needle—still loaded at the proximal third—is driven perpendicular into that same left lip. The driver releases and regrips as needed to follow the curve and deliver the tip cleanly out of the dermis; the forceps briefly assist at the exit to prevent uncontrolled drag. The operator pulls the suture through, leaves an appropriate tail on the left, and then begins forming the next knot loop on the surface. Throughout, the long strand is kept away from the working zone, sometimes crossing the pad diagonally but managed so it does not snag instruments or tissue.

As the sequence progresses into the second minute, the technique tightens: instruments stay within millimeters of the margin, eversion is consistent, and the needle remains orthogonal at entry. The working hands occasionally cross during pull-through, then separate as slack is drawn out. Knot-tying becomes more efficient—left hand posting with the needle holder, right hand throwing and reversing direction to square—then the knot is seated precisely at the left superior corner. The needle, when not in use, is safely parked in the driver and kept lateral to the bite site.

The final third of the session emphasizes finishing and repetition. After another near-edge bite is taken at the same left corner, the operator shifts fully to instrument ties: loops on the long limb, grasp-and-pass of the tail, alternating throws, progressive tension to seat the knot without twisting the tissue. With the knot secure, attention turns to tail management. Scissors are introduced from the left while the right hand lifts the strand to present it; the tail is cut close to the knot. The sequence is repeated—tighten, square, and trim—until a tidy knot sits at the superior-left incision edge with short tails.

In the closing moments, the hands withdraw. The pad remains centered on the wooden board, the leftmost incision shows a secured stitch at its corner, and loose suture lays clear of the operative field. No attempts are made to approximate the central or right-sided lacerations; the work has been a focused drill on fundamentals at one corner: precise near-edge bites, controlled pull-through, deliberate instrument ties, and clean tail trimming. The overall rhythm is consistent—present the edge, drive the needle orthogonally, park and tie, square and seat, then cut—executed calmly and repeatedly until the instruments are set down and the scene goes still.
