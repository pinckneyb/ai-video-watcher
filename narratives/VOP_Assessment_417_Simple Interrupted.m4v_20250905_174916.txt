Pattern: Simple Interrupted



Summative assessment:
The overall motion was controlled and confident, with a steady rhythm from bite to pull‑through to tie. Needle loading and wrist-driven arcs followed the needle’s curve cleanly, while strand management kept the field orderly and knots descending straight to the target.

Instrument coordination was efficient: the driver doubled as a tying tool without wasted movement, pickups appeared only when needed for eversion, and scissors entered only after knots were secure. The operator maintained symmetric tension and centered knots reliably, demonstrating procedural competence and good situational awareness.

To elevate further, standardize bite width and inter-stitch spacing along the entire line and minimize any unnecessary regrips or hovering between steps. Maintain the same disciplined perpendicular entry while ensuring consistent bite depth from the wound edge, and keep each throw low over the field to shorten air time and reduce extraneous motion.
