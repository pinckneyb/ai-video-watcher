Pattern: Simple Interrupted



Summative assessment:
The performance shows a steady, methodical rhythm with confident needle loading, perpendicular arcs, and clean hand-to-hand transfers. Knot sequences are deliberate and square, with the needle safely parked during tying and the suture managed to avoid clutter, indicating good situational control and awareness.

To elevate the flow, reduce off-field pauses and instrument switches by staging tools and trimming in batches, and keep both hands within the working zone to maintain momentum. Standardize inter-stitch spacing along each wound and minimize regrasping to preserve true 90-degree entries on every pass; compress the tying cadence slightly to tighten the overall sequence without sacrificing tissue respect. Overall, this is competent, safe technique with clear opportunities to streamline and make it teaching-grade.
