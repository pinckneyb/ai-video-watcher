COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure proceeds as a focused, methodical closure of the central vertical midline incision—the middle of the three parallel wounds on the silicone practice pad. From the outset the operator works the same midline defect, repeatedly placing and securing a series of interrupted skin-level bites to reapproximate epidermal/dermal edges. Throughout, the suturing is accomplished with standard two‑handed instrument technique: a needle holder/driver controls the curved, swaged needle while toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style) or fingertip manipulation control, evert, and stabilize the opposing margin. The team’s actions show a consistent procedural rhythm: precise needle placement through near‑edge, superficial‑to‑mid‑dermal bites, withdrawal and pull‑through of the suture, loop formation, tensioning and knot seating, then tail management. The hands and instruments remain closely coupled to the wound—typically within a few centimeters of each other and of the incision—to maintain fine control over needle trajectory and tissue apposition.

Initial passes and orientation (0–60 s)
At the opening frames the operator identifies the central small vertical incision and introduces a curved, swaged needle into the field. The needle driver approaches from one side (usually the operator’s left in frame orientation) and is used to drive the needle in a controlled arc across the gap while the opposing forceps lift and slightly evert the near edge. The driver grips the needle shaft roughly at mid‑to‑proximal portions—intentional to preserve purchase and control rather than grasping at the very tip—and presents the curve so the tip can enter perpendicular to the skin surface. Bites are shallow-to-moderate in depth, placed close to the epidermal margin to approximate skin without engaging deep bulk. After the tip exits the far margin the driver withdraws and the suture is pulled through; a visible limb is managed by the opposite hand in preparation for knot formation. The hands remain tightly coordinated, frequently crossing paths above the incision axis to exchange needle and suture control.

Progressive placement and loop formation (60–180 s)
As the sequence continues, the operator places additional interrupted bites along the same midline wound. Needle grips remain consistent—mid‑shaft, oriented to allow the natural curvature of the needle to produce a smooth arc through the tissue. The forceps consistently elevate and evert the target edge prior to penetration, minimizing drag and preventing deep, bulky bites. After each pass the needle is withdrawn while the free suture limb is tensioned; the operator forms a loop and begins the process of seating a knot. During this period the left and right hands alternate subtle roles: the driver performs the arc and withdrawal, then shifts to position for knot support while the forceps or fingers tension and loop the suture. In several frames the non‑dominant hand momentarily uses gloved fingertips—rather than only forceps—to manipulate the free tail and approximate the edges for final seating, especially when space is tight and tactile control is advantageous.

Knot tying, dressing, and suture management (180–360 s)
After initial passes are made, the operator devotes more frames to knot-tying, tightening, and dressing each interrupted stitch. The needle driver and forceps converge over the wound so one instrument can anchor or seat the knot while the other manipulates the tails. The operator uses short, controlled tugs to avoid over-tightening; this results in slight and consistent eversion of the epidermal margins at each stitch—appropriate for edge apposition to account for anticipated inversion on healing. Suture loops and prior bites act as reference points, helping the practitioner place subsequent stitches evenly and maintain consistent spacing. Throughout this phase, the needle is intermittently regrasped and repositioned in the driver to achieve an ideal arc and tip trajectory for clean dermal purchase. The forceps occasionally double as a thread handler or to bluntly rotate and dress the knot; fine scissors/hemostat appear intermittently to trim tails after knot seating.

Refinement of technique, handling of small defects (300–360 s)
Attention narrows to short stellate and punctate defects at the center of the pad. Here, the operator adjusts technique subtly—taking even smaller, more precise superficial dermal bites and using finer point forceps to evert and stabilize short, mobile edges. The needle driver is held more vertically above the wound in these frames, permitting tighter control of small‑arc passes. The left‑right instrument relationship remains consistent: the driver delivers the needle while the opposing forceps provides countertraction, guides the exit, and manages the suture limb. Knot construction follows identical principles but is adapted to the limited working envelope: shorter throws, gentler tensioning, and careful tail dressing to avoid puckering the surrounding tissue.

Sequential filling of the incision (360–540 s)
Working progressively along the full length of the central incision, the operator places additional interrupted sutures in sequence from one end toward the other (frames show movement from the superior toward inferior ends and back in some passes). Each bite is taken at a similar distance from the wound margin and at comparable depth, yielding an orderly row of stitches. Instrument positions evolve only modestly: the needle driver often approaches from above or slightly cephalad, while the forceps approach from the contralateral lateral side. Hands often cross, with tips meeting within 1–3 cm of the incision to ensure needle control and suture handling. At times the surgeon uses both a long needle holder and a second clamp to dress knots and manipulate tails; at others, gloved fingers supplement forceps handling to control slack and apposition. The operator maintains gentle eversion at each stitch and avoids deep tissue involvement throughout, keeping the bites at superficial to mid‑dermal depth appropriate for skin closure on this model.

Stabilization, tightening, and preparation for finishing (540–600 s)
As more stitches are placed and knots are dressed, the operator spends increased time on final tensioning and seat‑downs to achieve uniform edge approximation. Forceps hold and align neighboring margins while the driver tightens and dresses knots. Small tissue puckers from earlier passes are smoothed as subsequent stitches are added in close proximity, and suture tails are trimmed near the knot when space allows. Across these frames, the practitioner continues to grip the needle at the mid‑shaft and preserve controlled, perpendicular entries to the epidermis. The two hands remain intimately coordinated: one provides continuous countertraction, the other performs precise manipulations of needle, knot, and tail.

Noted discrepancy in late frames (585–599 s)
During the late portion of the film there is an anomalous appearance—a sequence consistent with a continuous or running configuration along the central incision, with a long trailing suture and multiple sequential passes already completed down the wound length. This contrasts with the prevailing interrupted‑stitch pattern seen throughout the rest of the video. That frame suggests either an intermittent change in closing strategy or an alternative depiction of tightening a long suture tail. Regardless, the remainder of the footage continues to reflect the interrupted‑style approach in which discrete bites are taken, pulled through and tied individually. The inconsistency is observed but does not materially change the overall interrupted closure strategy that dominates the procedure.

Hand position evolution and instrument dynamics
From beginning to end the operator keeps hands close to the wound to maximize fine motor control. The needle driver is usually on the same side across frames (commonly the left side from camera perspective), delivering needle arcs perpendicular to the skin plane. The tissue forceps, coming from the opposing side, consistently act as the counter‑traction and edge‑alignment instrument. Occasionally, the dominant hand alternates between driver and dressing instruments; the non‑dominant hand switches between forceps, fingertip handling, and small scissors/hemostat for tail control and trimming. Proximity between instruments remains tightly conserved—generally within a few centimeters—so that needle tips and forceps jaws cross with minimal travel and precise hand‑eye coordination. As stitches accumulate, the operator shifts slightly along the wound axis, moving superior to inferior (or vice versa) to complete a uniform series; instrument orientation adapts to the local topography (stellate area vs. linear edge) but retains the same core bimanual choreography.

Technique consistency and refinement
Overall the technique remains constant—planned, shallow dermal bites taken near the epidermal margins, controlled arcs of the curved needle, and consistent mid‑shaft needle grips permitting predictable tip behavior. Knotting is deliberate and conservative: small throws followed by dressing to avoid undue inversion or excess tension. Eversion at each bite is slight but consistent, intentionally generating an outward margin profile to favor epidermal edge alignment as the tissue heals. The operator demonstrates an economy of motion and a growing confidence with the needle, occasionally adjusting grips or reorienting the driver to maintain the most efficient arc as the curvature crosses different wound segments. When working in tighter, stellate areas the motions are smaller and more vertical; when working on longer linear segments they become slightly broader to accommodate longer needle travel. Despite minor variations, the foundational technique—controlled, interrupted skin closure using a curved swaged needle with instrumented bimanual control—remains unchanged.

Spatial relationships and tissue handling
Throughout the case, instruments converge directly over the wound. The needle driver occupies cephalad or medial positions relative to each bite, rotating the needle with deliberate wrist motion; the forceps or fingers approach from lateral or caudal positions to receive the needle, evert tissue, and manage the suture. The exchange of roles—driver to pull‑through, forceps to manage, fingers to tension and loop—occurs smoothly and repeatedly. Tissue handling is atraumatic in nature on the simulator: point contact with toothed pickups, light elevation and eversion, and avoidance of large bites. This approach minimizes unnecessary tissue bulk under the knot and reduces puckering. As stitches accumulate, the operator uses previously placed sutures as guides for spacing and alignment, ensuring consistent apposition across the entire repair.

Final appearance and closure state
By the end of the sequence the central incision is closed with a contiguous series of closely spaced, well‑approximating stitches. The skin edges are uniformly opposed with a controlled, slight eversion at each stitch. Knots are seated and dressed; short tails are managed and trimmed in several frames. The overall line is flat and continuous, with minimal inter‑stitch puckering and no overt gap along the repair. Instruments and hands withdraw gradually once the final throws are seated and tails are controlled. In a small subset of frames there is an appearance that could be interpreted as a continuous pass or long trailing suture, but the dominant and sustained action throughout the procedure remains the discrete placement and tying of individual interrupted skin stitches to close the central vertical incision.

Summary
Across the entire procedure the operator systematically reconstructs the midline wound by placing orderly, instrument‑controlled interrupted stitches. The consistent mid‑shaft needle grip, perpendicular needle presentation, and forceps‑mediated edge eversion produce reliable dermal/epidermal apposition. Hand positions stay tightly coupled to the incision, with minimal outward movement and tight instrument proximity to preserve needle control. Knot-tying and tail management are deliberate and careful, and the final closure shows a neatly approximated line with even spacing and slight everted edges. A brief inconsistency suggesting a running pattern is noted late in the recording, but it does not substantially alter the overall interrupted‑style technique that characterizes the procedural flow.
