COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel, cranial–caudal cuts, but all activity is concentrated on the vertical incision set furthest to the right near the pad’s lateral edge. From start to finish, the operator maintains focus on closing this single wound and methodically advances a series of interrupted skin stitches along its length, progressing from the lower-to-mid portion up toward the superior end. The other two cuts are never actively manipulated.

The sequence begins with setup and the first pass at the lower segment of the rightmost incision. A needle driver is centered over the wound, the jaws perpendicular to the curve of the needle, and the assisting hand introduces Adson forceps from the patient’s right side. With the near (right) edge gently grasped at its dermal margin, the operator everts and presents a few millimeters of tissue, then brings the needle in perpendicular to the skin surface. The needle is consistently held at the proximal-to-middle third of its body, allowing controlled wrist rotation to follow the natural arc. The first bite is initiated on the right lip, entered a few millimeters from the edge with intradermal-to-dermal depth, consistent with precise, superficial skin closure technique. As the needle traverses the near side, the strand trails laterally, and the driver prepares to guide the needle across the gap to the opposite edge.

Immediately thereafter, the operator reloads and continues the same stitch. The driver maintains a stance just left/medial to the incision as the forceps on the right stabilize the entry margin. The needle is advanced through the right edge and then prepared for passage to the left side, with the thread pulled through sufficiently to prevent snarling. Throughout, the hands stay in opposition: driver above and slightly medial, forceps lateral and close to the right lip, forming a compact working triangle over the cut. The opposite edge is not yet grasped in these earliest frames, signaling a staged, controlled approach to the full pass.

With the bite on the near edge achieved and the needle reloaded, the arc is followed toward the far side. The operator works orthogonally to the wound line, paying close attention to symmetric depth and spacing. The right-hand assistant alternates between gently steadying the near edge and controlling the free suture end to keep the field open. Once the needle exits, the suture is drawn through and the stitch is prepared for tying.

The first knotting sequence is carried out using instrument ties. At this point, the incision momentarily appears horizontally oriented, likely due to camera angle and hand position, but the field and suture tails unmistakably correspond to the same rightmost vertical line. The needle remains parked, and the needle driver is repurposed to form alternating throws. The supporting hand controls the free end, tensioning and presenting it to the driver. The loops are laid down neatly to seat the knot just to the right of the wound edge, and the approximation at this level is snug but not blanching. After securing the knot, scissors are introduced from above to trim the tails to a short length appropriate for skin closure. The finish is tidy, with the knot seated on the right side of the incision.

The surgeon then repeats a similar completion sequence on an adjacent stitch along this same wound, again using instrument ties to secure the throws and trimming the tails. Through these early tying sequences, there is no manipulation of other incisions. The technique remains consistent: the needle driver hovers superior to the bite site, the assisting hand stabilizes the strand or the tissue as needed, and the working distance remains small, ensuring control.

With the first segment closed and trimmed, attention shifts slightly superior along the same right-side incision to set up subsequent stitches. The operator spends time reloading and positioning the needle carefully over the superior portion of the slit. The driver grips the needle about one-third from the swage; the curve is maintained orthogonal to the skin. The right-hand forceps reappear to control the near edge, everting lightly while the driver fine-tunes entry angle and trajectory. During these preparatory frames, the emphasis is on orientation, depth planning, and maintaining a perpendicular bite across the wound. The scissors may flick briefly into the field but are not used for cutting at this stage.

A new stitch is then placed immediately above the previously tied knot. The forceps pick up the right margin, everting and presenting dermis without crushing, while the needle passes through the right lip, across the gap, and out the left edge at a matching depth. The suture is drawn through smoothly to avoid tearing the synthetic skin surface, leaving a controlled amount of slack for later knot seating. The line continues to advance along the same rightmost incision in an orderly fashion. Knot tying follows in a subsequent sequence: the driver handles alternating throws, the assisting hand holds the free strand lateral/inferior to the incision, and the knot is snugged centrally over the wound with gentle approximation. Tails are trimmed short with scissors, and the working area remains compact and well organized.

As the closure progresses into the mid-to-upper portion of this incision, the operator again pauses to position the needle. The right hand often carries the needle driver, approaching from the upper-right before settling centrally over the target bite site. The left hand introduces tissue forceps near the right lip to lift and evert the entry edge, making the dermal surface accessible. The needle is held reliably about two-thirds from the tip on the body, with the arc set for a standard perpendicular skin bite. Careful wrist rotation advances the needle through the right wound edge; the driver then regrips closer to the swage as needed to pull the strand through and reload for the exit. These maneuvers are controlled, with short, efficient regrips and consistent attention to visibility across the bite path.

Several sequences show the stitch being passed but not tied immediately, followed by frames dedicated to tying and trimming. This staged rhythm—place, draw through, tie, trim—repeats as the line marches superiorly. In one tying segment, the suture path across the skin edges appears more rectangular, giving a box-like impression; even so, the approach remains within the boundaries of the chosen interrupted skin closure technique, with the edges approximated neatly and evenly. After knot completion, scissors trim tails and the operator resets for the next bite just above the last placed knot.

Continuing toward the superior end, the surgeon maintains the same core principles:

- Entry and exit points are kept perpendicular to the skin surface, a few millimeters from the wound edge, with symmetric depth through the dermis.
- Edge eversion is prioritized. The right lip is typically lifted with Adson forceps during entry; the far edge is aligned and sometimes steadied by the assistant’s fingers as the needle emerges.
- The driver executes the arc with wrist motion, and the needle is regripped as needed for controlled extraction without tearing.
- The suture is drawn through smoothly to the desired slack, then, in a later sequence, tied down with alternating instrument throws and trimmed.

At one point near the superior third, a clamp/hemostat is applied to secure a prior strand at the top of the working field, preventing tangling while a new bite is initiated just below it. The driver approaches from the right-superior quadrant, the forceps oppose at the near edge, and the bite proceeds with the same perpendicular orientation. After passage, the hemostat remains out of the needle path, and the suture is once again managed to a clean working length.

Multiple passages at the upper segment are completed in close succession. In one set of frames, the driver is superior/central, while the right hand with forceps holds the near edge and guides the exit point. The needle passes through far-to-near or near-to-far depending on orientation, but always with consistent depth and spacing relative to previous stitches. The thread is then drawn through, the loop tracked across the wound crest, and the line progresses upward in small increments. At intervals, the operator foregoes the forceps and uses fingertips instead to evert or steady the margin while tensioning the free strand—an efficient adaptation when the bite path is already well visualized and the tissue cooperative.

Completion tasks punctuate these sequences. The operator regularly seats knots, presses them lightly with a fingertip to stabilize position, and trims tails to a short length with scissors. The spacing of knots stays uniform, the edges remain aligned without gapping, and the approximation improves steadily along the entire length of the rightmost incision. The two other vertical cuts remain untouched throughout, reinforcing the single-line continuity of the work.

Approaching the very top of the wound, a sequence shows a full pass completed with the driver alternating between slightly oblique and vertical positions to follow the needle’s curvature during passage and retrieval. The suture is pulled through, leaving adequate working length for a later tie. In a subsequent segment at the same superior area, the strand is pulled taut, excess is drawn away from the field, and tails are trimmed after tying, accompanied by light digital checks to confirm spacing and tension. The hands continue to work in close opposition: the driver hovering above the superior end, the forceps or fingers lateral/right to the incision guiding and stabilizing tissue or strand as needed.

A new pass is then placed at the very top of the incision. The right-hand forceps gently evert the edge, the driver holds the needle about two-thirds from the tip, the entry is perpendicular, and the pass proceeds across to the opposite side. The suture is drawn through without tearing the skin pad, and the stitch is set up for completion. In the final tying sequences at this end, the driver forms alternating throws while the other hand secures the free end, maintaining mild eversion and preventing torsion. The knot is snugged down in line with the prior closures, and the tails are cut.

By the last moments of the footage, the wound edges along this rightmost incision are largely approximated with a series of neat interrupted stitches extending from lower to superior portions. Knots are seated with short tails aligned on the right side of the line. The tissue shows consistent eversion, and prior stitches exhibit uniform spacing and depth. A single frame shows the needle driver hovering at the very top of the same incision, suggesting the operator is poised to assess placement of a potential additional stitch at the apex if needed. However, there is no new bite captured in that instant. The closure as seen is cohesive and coherent from inferior to superior, with no engagement of the other parallel incisions at any time.

Throughout the procedure, several technique features remain stable:

- Needle handling: The driver typically grips the needle at the proximal third to mid-shaft, allowing reliable control of the arc. The needle is oriented perpendicular to the skin surface, and the driver often regrips near the swage or closer to the tip during extraction to maintain a smooth passage. The operator frequently pauses to optimize entry angle and trajectory before committing to a bite, ensuring symmetry across the incision.

- Tissue handling: The right wound margin is commonly lifted with Adson or similar forceps to evert and expose the dermis. Forceps are applied delicately—no crushing is visible—and are released and regripped as the needle advances. In some sequences, the assistant’s fingers substitute for forceps to provide gentle countertraction or to manage the free suture end while maintaining exposure. Bites are small, a few millimeters from the edge, and depth remains within the dermal plane appropriate for skin closure on a synthetic pad, ensuring precise edge approximation.

- Suture management: After each pass, the suture is drawn through with measured tension to prevent tearing and to avoid pulling the needle unintentionally back into the field. The operator alternates between strands efficiently during tying, forming clean, alternating instrument throws that lock the knot. Tails are cut promptly to keep the field uncluttered, and in one segment a hemostat secures a prior strand to keep it out of the way for the next bite.

- Spatial relationships and ergonomics: The hands consistently work in opposition across the incision, keeping a short working distance and the instruments nearly parallel to the wound line. The driver often approaches from a superior or slightly medial position, while forceps or fingers stay lateral on the patient’s right. As the line ascends, the operator adapts hand orientation—sometimes the left hand carries the driver and sometimes the right—yet the relative positioning remains functionally the same: one instrument drives and retrieves the needle, the other stabilizes tissue or manages the strand.

- Technique consistency: Even when one segment shows a box-like suture path during tying, the overall approach remains that of the selected interrupted skin closure. No alternative pattern is pursued along the line; rather, the bites and knots maintain a consistent look and spacing that together approximate the wound edges progressively.

In summary, the closure proceeds in an orderly, continuous march along the single rightmost vertical incision. The operator initiates a stitch, passes the needle with a perpendicular, controlled arc, draws the suture through, ties it down with instrument throws, trims the tails, and then moves a short distance superior to repeat the process. Forceps use is measured and purposeful for eversion; at times, fingers suffice for countertraction and strand control. The line extends steadily upward, and by the end of the captured sequence the wound edges are brought together along nearly the entire length with well-spaced, neat interrupted knots. The final view shows instruments poised at the superior end, suggesting readiness to place one additional stitch if needed at the very top, but the closure as presented is functionally complete, with even approximation, maintained eversion, short tails, and a clean, organized field confined entirely to this one incision.
