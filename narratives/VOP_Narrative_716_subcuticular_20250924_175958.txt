COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic skin pad bearing three parallel vertical incisions. The rightmost slit already shows a dense line of closely spaced stitches running its length; the midline slit is open at the outset, bordered by paired guide dots; the left slit remains unused throughout. The operative focus is directed to the midline cut, which will be closed methodically with individual passes and secure instrument ties, progressing from its lower portion upward. The operator consistently uses a needle driver and Adson-style forceps in a coordinated, two‑handed technique. The needle is routinely held on its body around the proximal third to mid-third, oriented perpendicular to the skin surface, and driven in a controlled arc to respect the needle curvature and avoid tissue skiving. Throughout, the forceps evert the wound edges gently, presenting the dermis for precise, symmetric bites at the marked dots.

The first sequence begins at the inferior end of the midline incision. The left hand holds the needle driver vertically over the wound, and the right hand’s forceps stabilize the patient’s right edge. The needle, grasped about mid‑shaft, is aimed from the patient’s right lip toward the left. The driver maintains a near‑90° approach, piercing the right edge at a dot a few millimeters from the margin, and then advancing along a short, orthogonal arc across the gap. The right hand then releases and regrips the left edge to receive the tip, ensuring slight eversion and alignment as the needle exits. The strand is drawn through in preparation for completion. Immediately thereafter, the operator continues working along the midline with the same instrument roles. The driver’s jaws remain square to the skin; the forceps sequentially lift each margin to expose consistent dermal thickness. Passes across the incision are completed with symmetric depth and spacing; no crushing of tissue is apparent. As the strand is pulled through, it is managed neatly away from the field to maintain visibility. Following these initial passes, instrument ties are performed with alternating throws. The knot is seated directly over the bite, with tension balanced along the axis of the wound, and excess length is prepared for trimming.

With a small gap closed at the bottom of the midline slit, the operator shifts slightly superior, again using the left hand to drive and the right hand to evert edges at the dots. The curved needle is presented perpendicular to the surface and advanced in a smooth, forehand motion. After crossing the gap, the driver regrips the needle mid-curve to complete the pull-through cleanly. The free strand occasionally drapes across adjacent areas of the pad; the operator responds by repositioning it to avoid entanglement before setting the next bite. These lower-to-midline stitches are placed in a repeating pattern of symmetric bites: lift with forceps, orthogonal entry with the driver, follow-through along the curve, then regrip and retrieve on exit. This cadence preserves edge eversion and consistent spacing as the closure advances proximally.

As the work ascends into the lower half of the midline slit, the instrument roles sometimes reverse to suit access: the right hand takes the driver while the left hand controls tissue or the suture short end. Regardless of which hand drives, the technical elements remain consistent—needle held around the proximal third, perpendicular to skin, short rotational arcs through each edge, and careful control of both the near and far margins. The operator demonstrates precise handling on the pre‑placed dots, maintaining equal offset from each edge and a uniform dermal depth. At intervals, after completing a pass through both sides, the operator removes slack and transitions to instrument ties. One hand acts as the post while the other forms loops; throws are alternated to seat square knots directly on top of the wound without cinching the tissue excessively. The edges come together with slight eversion, and visible crush injury is avoided.

As the closure reaches the mid-portion of the midline incision, more advanced sequencing appears. The operator at times regrips the needle mid-curve on exit to maintain optimal orientation for the next bite, minimizing unnecessary hand repositioning. The forceps continue to present the wound margins just ahead of the needle trajectory, guarding entry points and preventing needle skive. After individual passes, the suture is drawn through and tensioned laterally to align the edges. Knot tying proceeds with instrument ties: the driver forms loops while the opposite instrument posts and advances the knot down to the wound. Multiple throws are used to secure each stitch; tails are left appropriately short, and occasionally scissors enter to trim at the completion of a throw. The rhythm of pass, tension, tie, and trim repeats steadily as the closure marches upward.

Moving into the superior half of the midline incision, the operator continues to place well‑spaced, symmetric bites, now with more frequent transitions between passage and tying in the same field of view. The needle is often held two‑thirds from the tip in the driver, emphasizing control during tissue entry. The right hand’s forceps maintain gentle traction on the edge being entered, then cross to the opposite side to prepare for the exit. Several sequences highlight the driver working from the operator’s left across to the right, then reloading to work back from right to left—this deliberate alternation maintains an optimal angle of approach while preserving the perpendicular orientation to the skin. Where visibility is briefly compromised by a forearm during reloading, the instrument quickly repositions, and the procedure returns to the same site with undisturbed tissue control.

At the upper third of the midline wound, the technique includes moments of knot setup immediately after passage. The operator grasps the short standing end close to the wound, uses the driver to form loops, and advances the knot with the assistant instrument maintaining the post. In some sequences, the needle is left parked on the long limb off to the side while the knot is finalized, then reloaded afterwards to continue. Edges are approximated in a controlled manner; the knots are seated directly over entry/exit points without lateral drift. Where a prior stitch sits just below, the new knot is placed without trapping excess tissue between throws, maintaining even spacing.

As the closure nears completion at the top of the midline incision, the final interrupted stitches are placed and tied with the same careful attention to eversion and symmetric depth. The operator occasionally employs hand-to-hand needle transfers to expedite orientation for the next pass. The forceps at this stage may grasp the needle briefly on exit to guide the curve and prevent trajectory deviation. After drawing the suture through, the driver and assistant instrument converge centrally, forming and seating additional square throws to lock the stitch. The knot tightening is smooth and deliberate; when tension approximates the edges, it is immediately relaxed slightly to avoid strangulation. Final tails are trimmed close where indicated.

Across the entire midline closure, the spatial choreography remains consistent. The instruments straddle the wound; the driver approaches perpendicular to the tissue while the forceps lift and evert the edges just ahead of the needle. Movements are economical: short wrist rotations to follow the curve, brief regrips at mid‑curve on exit, and controlled suture management to keep strands clear. The free limb is directed superiorly or laterally to maintain a clear operative window. Even when instrument roles swap between hands—driver in the left then right, or assistant instrument changing from forceps to a second driver during ties—the geometry around the wound remains the same: hands in opposition across the incision, converging to pass and tie, then separating to reload and set up the next bite.

Throughout these sequences, an adjacent right-sided incision with a pre‑existing, closely spaced stitch line remains in the field as a reference. At intervals, separate actions occur on that line—terminal knot tying at its superior end, tensioning along the running segment, a locking maneuver on an advancing pass, and later trimming at the apex. These management steps on the right‑side line are performed with the same meticulous instrument control, including hand ties and instrument ties where the right hand often functions as the post and the left hand advances loops. The needle on that line is grasped at the mid-body, oriented perpendicular for brief repositioning, then released as tying proceeds. Tissue manipulation there is minimal, with forceps only briefly stabilizing the edge while securing the terminal knot. These episodes are discrete and do not interrupt the main cadence of closing the midline incision; they appear as adjunct demonstrations and do not alter the technique applied to the midline closure.

In the mid‑to‑upper sequences of the midline wound, additional refinements are evident. The operator uses triangulation with the suture limb held gently under tension by the non-driving instrument, creating a stable frame that guides the next needle entry. At times, the suture tail is grasped with a ring-handled instrument to maintain balanced traction and prevent the loop from slackening; this improves bite accuracy and prevents suture from masking the field. Where a prior pass has been made, slack is meticulously removed before the next bite to maintain consistent approximation along the length of the wound. The driver never clamps the needle on the tip; instead it holds on the proximal third to preserve needle integrity and ensure predictable arcs through tissue.

Multiple scenes at the superior end of the midline incision show final stitches being tied off. The driver captures the short end, loops are formed around the instrument, and the knot is advanced with the assistant instrument maintaining a straight post. These are classic instrument ties, alternating throws to create a square knot and then adding additional throws for security. The knot is seated directly over the center of the incision with edges aligned and slightly everted. The sequence continues in this pattern—place symmetric bites at the dots, draw the suture across, then tie—until the entire visible portion of the midline slit is approximated.

By the later sequences, the midline incision displays multiple well‑spaced, secure stitches along its length. Where an earlier knot sits below, the next stitch is set with careful attention to spacing so that eversion is maintained without excessive edge tension. The operator demonstrates consistent tissue respect: forceps hold only the dermal margins with minimal compression; the needle passes are quick and precise; the suture is drawn through smoothly without drag. Cuts, where performed, leave neat tails, and no free strand is left to snag or obscure subsequent passes.

While the right‑side incision receives terminal tying and a brief running advancement with a locking capture in isolated segments—followed by definitive knot placement and tail trimming at its top—these are self-contained actions on a separate line. They include controlled positioning of the needle just beside the wound, tensioning of the standing end, and formation of loops around the driver or by hand, cinching down directly onto the apex. Forceps briefly stabilize the tissue and the exiting strand; otherwise, tissue handling is minimal as this line is already closed. These interludes underscore consistent technique across sites but do not redirect the primary effort away from the midline closure.

In the final view of the central wound after the last instrument ties are seated, the midline incision is uniformly approximated. Bites are symmetrical and aligned with the premarked guide dots. The edges are brought together with slight eversion, and knots lie centered over the line without lateral drift. Suture tails appear trimmed to an appropriate length where trimming occurred; where not trimmed in-view, tails are controlled and directed along the wound axis. The overall result is a tidy, evenly closed central incision, achieved through repeated, consistent application of precise needle handling, gentle forceps eversion, careful suture management, and secure instrument ties from the lower third up toward the superior end.

Notable technical themes throughout include:
- Needle handling discipline: holding at the body near the proximal third, maintaining perpendicular entry, and following the curve with controlled wrist rotation.
- Edge protection and eversion: forceps grasp only the dermal margin, lifting slightly to avoid bite too close to the edge and to ensure symmetric depth.
- Suture control: strands are kept lateral or superior to avoid field obscuration; at times a ring-handled instrument grasps the tail to maintain tension and triangulation.
- Knot quality: instrument ties are used predominantly, with square knots laid flat over the incision and additional throws for security; knots are seated without over‑tightening to prevent tissue strangulation.
- Spatial awareness: hands consistently straddle the incision, converging for passes and ties, then separating to reload, with unobtrusive, economical movements that preserve visualization.
- Minor deficiencies addressed: occasional draping of the free strand across adjacent areas is corrected promptly; a brief forearm occlusion during needle reloading is resolved with an immediate return to the same site and restored exposure.

By the end, the midline incision demonstrates a continuous series of well‑placed interrupted closures with uniform spacing and eversion, indicating a careful, stepwise approximation from inferior to superior. The right‑side incision, already bearing a continuous line of closely spaced stitches, receives its terminal management—locking, knot tying, and trimming—without affecting the progression or integrity of the central closure. The field finishes orderly, with the midline wound edges neatly approximated and secured, and all suture management completed in a controlled, methodical fashion.
