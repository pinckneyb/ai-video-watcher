COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with deliberate setup over a synthetic skin pad that has four parallel incisions, with attention focused on the far-right slit. From the first moments (0–59 s), the surgeon establishes a consistent hand relationship: the left hand carries a needle driver and the right hand uses fine forceps. The needle is loaded on its proximal-to-middle third and oriented perpendicular to the pad. The right hand lightly lifts the inferior lip to present the entry site while the left hand dials in a true 90-degree approach. In the lower-right corner of the pad, the surgeon rehearses the angles, regrasping the needle a few times without yet taking a bite.

A quick reference mark is placed (60–74 s), then the right hand switches from marker to a driver with the preloaded needle. The left hand briefly hovers in support while the right-hand driver ratchets down the grasp; no tissue contact yet. Over the next sequences (75–104 s), the left hand resumes control of the driver while the right hand alternates between forceps and a second driver, assisting with needle presentation. Together they tune the grasp and rotate the arc until the needle sits truly orthogonal to the rightmost incision. Forceps touch the needle more than tissue—this is meticulous loading and positioning with the suture draped away from the wound.

With alignment established, the first passes are made (105–119 s). The left-hand driver rotates the needle across the near edge with textbook perpendicular entry and an even depth. The right hand does not grasp tissue in this initial passage; instead it manages the free strand, controlling slack and keeping the field clear. Immediately after, the right hand clamps the tail to preserve tension (120–134 s), signaling preparation for tying. The knot itself occurs between frames; by 135–149 s the right hand has scissors and trims the tail close to the knot while the left hand reacquires the needle driver to reload the needle for the next stitch.

From here the rhythm settles into a repeatable cadence: present, drive, receive, pull-through, reload, tie, trim. In the next placement (150–164 s), the left hand drives and the right hand uses pickups to evert the near edge and then receive the needle tip on exit, controlling its trajectory. The driver regrips mid-arc to complete the passage smoothly. The following setup (165–179 s) is all about angle: the needle is reloaded from near-vertical to a slightly oblique presentation, curve aligned to follow its path. This continues (180–194 s) with gentle edge control by the right-hand forceps, a clean rotation through the dermis, and controlled pull-through without crushing.

Midway through the first row, there are alternating phases of positioning and passage. Between 195–224 s the left-hand driver repeatedly reorients the needle and presents it to the rightmost incision. There’s a brief instrument handoff (210–224 s): the needle is transferred and fine-tuned by the right hand with forceps, then repossessed by the left hand for entry. The next set (225–239 s) shows the classic opposition—driver from superior, forceps from inferior—stabilizing the edge, rotating the needle, and regrasping to reset for the subsequent bite.

A short interlude emphasizes instrument versatility (240–254 s). After reloading, the needle is passed instrument-to-instrument to set up a right-handed throw, then returned to the usual left-dominant driving. Over 255–269 s, the left hand advances the needle while the right hand primarily manages the suture strand, pulling it away to keep the target zone visible. With bites placed, the surgeon switches gears to knot tying (270–284 s): the left-hand driver performs instrument ties while the right-hand pickups hold the tail and maintain vertical tension over the wound. Throws are laid down neatly, the knot is seated, and the hands oppose to cinch without lateral drift.

Tail trimming and immediate setup for the next stitch happen in quick succession (285–299 s). The rightmost incision shows several tied stitches now; tails are cut precisely at the knot line, then the left-hand driver returns with a reloaded needle while the right-hand forceps migrate to the next target—likely the adjacent incision—everting the edge to present an entry point. As the sequence continues (300–329 s), the right hand helps retrieve the needle tip from the right wound edge, then passes it to the left-hand driver for a secure, perpendicular grasp. The needle is reloaded repeatedly with small adjustments; forceps briefly touch the needle body to refine orientation, then release so the driver can own the arc.

Housekeeping returns in pulses (330–344 s): the right hand uses scissors to trim tails while the left hand steadies the suture. Immediately afterward (345–359 s) the left-hand driver reloads again, with the right hand presenting the needle near the swage and shepherding the free strand off the needle’s path. The next pass (360–374 s) shows the mature technique: forceps lightly evert the near edge, the driver engages the needle about two-thirds from the tip, rotates through, then regrips closer to the swage to pull the needle cleanly. The suture is drawn cranially, away from prior stitches, and the right-hand forceps briefly take the needle body to aid reloading for the next throw.

The cadence continues (375–389 s) with controlled pull-throughs and consistent edge handling, followed by another trimming phase (390–404 s) where the right hand cuts while the left-hand driver tensions the suture line to present each tail. After tidying, the surgeon repositions for another bite (405–419 s), with the driver approaching from the top-left and forceps everting the edge on the right, targeting a fresh entry point adjacent to the previous row.

A short lull follows (420–434 s): instruments leave the field briefly. When activity resumes (435–449 s), the left-hand driver once again aligns the needle over the rightmost incision, with the right hand everting the target edge; this is careful setup rather than an immediate pass. The next beat (450–464 s) blends suture control and trimming—forceps steady the bite line while scissors cut tails—before moving straight back into needle reloading (465–479 s). Over 480–494 s, the right hand alternates efficiently between scissors for tail trimming and forceps for edge stabilization, while the left-hand driver holds the needle poised for the next entry.

The final functional action is a last round of tail management (495–509 s): the right hand lifts individual knots, the left hand cuts close, and then both instruments clear the field. A placement card is set down and, in the closing frames (510–521 s), a ring-handled instrument is briefly parked off to the top-right—no further suturing occurs.

Across the video, the technique evolves from careful, two-handed setup into a smooth, economical cycle. Early frames emphasize loading, perpendicular alignment, and entry-site presentation; mid-procedure sequences show a confident rhythm of edge eversion, perpendicular penetration, regrasp mid-arc, forceps capture of the exiting needle, and disciplined suture management kept to the operator’s right. Instrument ties are performed with consistent hand opposition and vertical seating over the wound, followed by precise tail trimming that never disturbs prior stitches. The surgeon occasionally swaps instrument roles or performs instrument-to-instrument needle transfers to optimize angle, but the dominant pattern remains left-hand driving with right-hand countertraction and presentation.

The overall flow is methodical and modular: prepare the edge, drive the bite along the needle’s arc, control the exit, clear slack, reload, tie, and trim—then repeat. Short pauses to reset the field, mark entry points, or withdraw instruments punctuate the work, but the momentum is steady. By the end, the rightmost incision carries a tidy row of simple interrupted sutures with short, trimmed tails, and the workspace is cleared—an orderly conclusion to a careful, well-controlled suturing sequence.
