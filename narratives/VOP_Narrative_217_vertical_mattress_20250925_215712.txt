COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure focuses on a single vertical skin incision located at the right lateral margin of the practice skin pad. At the outset the incision presents as a full‑thickness linear slit with slightly gaping edges and a small notch inferiorly. The operator works consistently on this same right‑side wound throughout the recording, progressing along its length in a methodical, sequential manner.

Initial approach and first passes (0–60 s)
Work begins with the operator positioning both gloved hands close to the right‑most incision. The dominant hand holds a needle driver while the nondominant hand holds fine tissue forceps. The needle driver commonly approaches from above and slightly medial or cephalad, the forceps occupying a lateral or distal position to the wound. A curved, swaged needle—grasped near the midshaft in most passes—is oriented with its tip down toward the skin surface. Early frames show the driver aligning the needle to take a short, controlled bite through the near dermal edge while the forceps tent and evert the opposing margin to present the tissue. The needle trajectory is shallow to perpendicular, and the operator intermittently re‑grasps the driver to refine the angle.

The synthetic skin behaves predictably: initial bites are placed close to the epidermal margin, bites are superficial to mid‑dermal, and the forceps provide gentle point traction rather than wide undermining. After passage the suture is pulled through, the ends are shuttled to staging positions, and the loop is prepared for knot formation. Throughout these early actions instruments remain within a few centimeters of each other, crossing briefly as the needle is drawn through.

Establishing the pattern and early knot tying (60–150 s)
As procedure continues, additional interrupted stitches are placed in short succession along the same incision. Bites are taken sequentially up the length of the wound, each time with the needle driver applying a controlled arc motion and the forceps stabilizing or everting the tissue. Occasionally the operator pauses after a pass to tension and manipulate the suture loop—tightening knots, arranging tails, or trimming with scissors when necessary. The needle is sometimes grasped closer to the hub for better leverage on tighter arcs; at other times the driver holds it mid‑shaft to permit finer rotation.

The operator demonstrates consistent hand choreography: the driver remains the active instrument for needle passage and rotation, advancing from superior or medial trajectories, while the forceps present tissue laterally or inferiorly and handle the suture tails. Knot formation is performed with coordinated opposing movements—forceps holding the loop while the driver advances and tensions throws. Slight puckering and eversion at the suture sites become evident as stitches are secured, reflecting superficial dermal engagement appropriate for skin edge apposition.

Mid‑procedure refinement and steady progression (150–300 s)
Midway through the recording the stitch line is well established inferiorly and work concentrates toward the central and superior portions of the incision. The overall pattern remains interrupted simple stitches placed in a serial fashion along the wound axis. The operator adjusts grip positions depending on the step: during needle insertion the driver is gripped close to the shaft for control of the curved needle’s arc; while pulling the suture through and tying, the driver or a secondary instrument may grasp the suture near the knot to advance or clip tails.

Tissue handling remains focused on gentle eversion and precise edge alignment. Forceps types noted include Adson‑style pickups and toothed forceps; these are used to lift and evert the wound edge, maintain countertraction during needle passage, and hold suture tails for secure knot tying. The synthetic dermis tolerates superficial-to-mid‑dermal bites, and the operator intentionally avoids deep layer engagement—each stitch brings the epidermal margins into close apposition with slight eversion to promote optimal skin edge healing.

Throughout this phase instruments frequently cross over the incision, and the driver often approaches from a superior‑lateral vector while the forceps rest medial‑inferior. The working space is compact—tips of instruments typically remain within 1–4 cm of each other—allowing tight control of needle trajectory and suture tension. Small variations are present: at times a mattress‑style orientation is briefly suggested or the needle is grasped nearer the swage, but the practical effect is continued placement of discrete interrupted bites along the same linear closure.

Transition to superior segments and finishing passes (300–420 s)
As the operator advances toward the superior end of the wound, the procedural rhythm is steady: the needle is rotated in a controlled arc through the near edge, retrieved, and passed through the opposing edge; the suture is drawn through, staged, and then secured with knot throws. The bites remain closely spaced and evenly distributed, producing a uniform line of slight tissue eversion and minimal residual gapping between stitches.

Hand positioning shows subtle evolution: the needle driver alternates between entering from above/medial and from a more lateral/superior trajectory when accessing tighter superior segments. The nondominant hand continues to present and stabilize tissue, at times withdrawing briefly to allow scissors or another instrument to trim suture tails. During knot completion the driver may temporarily hold the needle or the suture near the knot to tension throws while the forceps manipulate tails and maintain edge apposition.

Operator technique includes disciplined regrasping of the needle when required—particularly when withdrawing it through dense synthetic tissue or maneuvering near prior stitches. Depth of bite remains superficial-to-mid dermal and consistent with skin‑edge approximation goals; the operator avoids excessive tension that would cause marked puckering, maintaining a balance that achieves slight eversion without undue tissue strangulation.

Final tying, trimming, and inspection (420–467 s)
In the closing frames attention shifts to finalizing and securing the most superior stitches and tidying suture tails. Knot tying maneuvers are evident: coordinated advancement of throws, alternating tension between suture limbs, and the use of forceps to position and hold loops while the driver completes locking throws. Scissors or small cutting instruments are used intermittently to trim excess suture after secure knots are confirmed. The operator makes minor adjustments to suture tension and alignment to ensure uniform apposition along the entire repair.

Throughout this concluding stage the hands remain closely clustered adjacent to the incision; the driver typically occupies a superior or lateral position while the forceps sit medially to hold tissue and suture ends. Instrument tips remain within a couple of centimeters of each other, facilitating fine control for knot security and final edge alignment. In a few frames instrument overlap obscures fine details of knot morphology, but overall the pattern of sequential interrupted closure is clear.

Overall technique and spatial dynamics
From start to finish the operator uses a repeatable, deliberate technique: curved‑needle passes using a needle driver with mid‑shaft to proximal grips for control; tissue presentation and eversion using fine forceps; sequential interrupted bites placed in close, even spacing; knot formation with staged throws and tail management; and final trimming for a tidy closure. The bites are consistently superficial to mid‑dermal in depth, appropriate for skin approximation on the synthetic pad, and are placed to produce slight eversion at each point for optimal epidermal edge contact.

Hand positions maintain a characteristic relationship to the wound: the needle driver acting as the dominant active instrument usually approaches from an above/medial or superior‑lateral vector, rotating the curved needle through the tissue, while the nondominant hand—using Adson‑style, toothed, or fine pick‑up forceps—stabilizes the opposing edge, controls suture tails, and assists with knot greater precision. Instruments cross and reorient as needed in a confined workspace, but the spatial coordination remains efficient and consistent throughout.

Final appearance and wound status
By the end of the sequence the right‑lateral incision is uniformly approximated along its length. A continuous line of evenly spaced, securely tied interrupted stitches closes the defect from inferior to superior. Each bite imparts slight eversion at the skin margins, and there is minimal residual gapping between closures. Suture tails have been managed and trimmed in the concluding moments. The wound edges lie in close, gentle apposition, demonstrating a reproducible simple interrupted technique applied methodically to achieve a tidy, stable skin closure on the synthetic model.

Deficiencies and visual limitations
A few frames provide only partial views—instrument overlap during tight knot tying obscures the exact depth of some bites and finer knot morphology. Occasional minor variations (a brief mattress‑like bite suggested in one frame set, or differing needle grasp positions) are present, but these do not alter the overall interrupted‑stitch strategy or the continuity of repair. The sequence documents a clear, consistent approach to closing the right‑lateral incision with repetitive, controlled needle passes, careful tissue handling, and methodical knot security leading to a completed, well‑approximated wound.
