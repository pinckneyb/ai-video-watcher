Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion matured from deliberate setup to a reproducible cycle: present, drive, receive, pull-through, reload, tie, trim. Needle control was disciplined—entries were orthogonal and arcs were respected—while the non-driving hand consistently managed edge presentation and suture line to keep the field clear. The hand opposition during instrument ties was stable with vertical seating, and you maintained clean planes without lateral drift.
