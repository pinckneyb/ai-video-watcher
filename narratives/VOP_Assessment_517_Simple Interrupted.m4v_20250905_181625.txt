RUBRIC ASSESSMENT

1. Perpendicular needle passes 4/5 proficient
- Needle is consistently loaded at the proximal-to-middle third and driven with pronation/supination to maintain a near-90° trajectory, with regrips to preserve perpendicularity and minimal shear. Reliable right-angle passes across the slit earn a 4.

2. Gentle tissue handling 4/5 proficient
- Adsons are used primarily to evert and stabilize with protective control of the needle tip and minimal drag, avoiding crushing or multiple traumatic grasps. Consistently respectful handling warrants a 4.

3. Square, secure knots 4/5 proficient
- Instrument ties alternate wraps, are pulled flat with opposing vectors, and are seated centrally with neat stacks and no loosening. Repeated, deliberate square knots merit a 4.

4. Appropriate approximation/tension 3/5 competent
- Edges are approximated without gapping, but mild puckering is evident along the line. Slight over-tension lowers this to a 3.

5. Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm) 3/5 competent
- Stitches are uniformly spaced and aligned with consistent cadence, but interval control is not explicitly demonstrated to the 0.5–1.0 cm standard. Competent and consistent earns a 3.

6. Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable) 4/5 proficient
- Mild eversion is maintained throughout with centered knots and no inversion. This meets and slightly exceeds the standard, scoring a 4.

7. Economy of time and motion 4/5 proficient
- The place–pull-through–park–tie–cut–reload rhythm is steady with safe needle parking, efficient role switching, and minimal unnecessary travel. This efficient flow supports a 4.

SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT

Your motion is deliberate and controlled, with crisp needle loading, perpendicular entry/exit, and disciplined regrips that preserve the needle’s arc. Tying shows confident, alternating instrument throws pulled flat across the incision, with consistent centering and a tidy knot stack; the workflow cycles cleanly from bite to tie to cut without hesitation or clutter.

Refine tension management to eliminate the mild puckering: seat each throw flat, then stop as soon as the epidermal edges just touch, maintaining equal counter-traction rather than downforce. Pre-plan spacing to a reproducible 0.5–1.0 cm using a visual “ruler,” and standardize bite width and depth symmetrically from the edge to further polish consistency. Maintain the same gentle forceps discipline while tying to avoid any unnecessary tissue contact, and keep hand paths short and parallel to the wound to preserve efficiency.
