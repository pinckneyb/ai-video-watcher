COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure is focused on the single vertical incision on the right side of the practice pad — a full‑thickness linear cut located in the right‑central/upper‑right quadrant (variously described in frames as the second vertical slit from the right or the right‑third of the pad). From the start to the finish of the recording, all needle passes, tissue manipulations and suture work occur along this one right‑sided vertical wound, adjacent to a previously placed column of stitches that runs medially along the same incision. The operator repeatedly engages the same incision, working sequentially along its length from mid/lower segments toward the superior apex, alternating between placing new bites, advancing an existing run of stitches and performing final tightening and knot securing at the superior end.

Initial approach and mid‑wound work (0.0–29.0 s)
The sequence opens with the operator bracketing the right‑sided incision with a standard two‑handed technique. The dominant hand (usually described as the right) holds a needle driver (sometimes a combined needle driver/scissors instrument or one with a gold handle), while the non‑dominant hand uses toothed Adson‑type forceps to grasp tissue and manage the suture tail. The needle is a curved, swaged surgical needle; the driver grasps it near the mid‑shaft-to‑distal third to obtain controlled arcs through tissue. Early frames show the operator taking a perpendicular, full‑thickness bite through the near edge while the forceps tents the opposite edge, allowing controlled capture of superficial dermis without excessive bulk. Several existing stitches already lie medial to the working site; the operator places an additional bite at the mid‑to‑lower portion of the incision and draws the suture through, preparing it for securing.

As the narrative continues into the next short interval, the operator shifts slightly superior and lateral, approaching the lateral wound margin at a shallow oblique angle. Hands remain close to the wound (typically within 1–4 cm), instruments crossing slightly at times. The needle driver maintains a mid‑body grip on the curved needle; small, controlled arcs drive the needle tip through the full thickness or the superficial dermis depending on the exact pass. The forceps consistently elevate and slightly evert the wound edge before passage, producing precise, superficial bites close to the epidermal margin. The suture tail is actively managed by the non‑dominant hand to avoid tangling and to present slack for the next throw.

Sequential placement along the wound (30.0–74.0 s)
From about 30 to 74 seconds the operator progresses along the incision, adding successive bites adjacent to previously placed stitches. The hands remain paired over the wound—the needle driver on one side and the forceps on the other—coordinating grip, tissue tension and needle trajectory. The needle is repeatedly grasped near its body rather than at the very tip to allow a consistent curvature of passage and controlled rotation through tissue. The operator alternates short passes with occasional exteriorization and regrasping of the needle to complete the arc, indicating careful attention to needle purchase and tissue bite depth.

Tissue handling is consistently delicate: the forceps tent a narrow cuff of dermis, preventing deep bites and ensuring the suture only captures superficial dermis and epidermal edge for good edge apposition. Slight eversion is frequently produced as the bites are taken, a deliberate maneuver intended to counteract expected inversion after tying and to achieve optimal eversion at the skin surface. The working distance between the two instruments remains close (around 2–4 cm), facilitating accurate needle transfer and suture management. At times the operative hand positions invert—occasional frames show the left hand holding the driver and the right holding forceps—but the relative arrangement across the wound is consistent: one instrument advances the needle while the other provides countertraction and suture control.

Addition and reinforcement near adjacent suture lines (75.0–119.0 s)
As the procedure continues, attention stays on the same right‑sided vertical incision, now working at sites immediately adjacent to an existing running/pink suture line medially. The operator adds interrupted bites lateral to that line and also places short controlled passes that extend or reinforce the existing column of stitches. Needle handling remains consistent: mid‑shaft grips, curved needle arcs rotated through tissue, and small bites that include epidermis and superficial dermis. The non‑dominant hand intermittently manages the free suture tail, lays counter‑traction across the pad and stabilizes the wound margins.

During this interval the operator occasionally pauses after a pass to pull the suture through, tension it, and prepare the loop for a securing throw. The sequence shows both new passes being added and some frames where the operator appears to be completing a stitch—advancing or locking a knot rather than creating a fresh distant bite. Hands are typically adjacent to the wound (<2–3 cm separation), and instruments cross or run parallel depending on the specific maneuver. Slight differences in handedness are observed: in some frames the left hand holds the driver and performs needle passes, in others the right hand is the driver. Despite these small variations, the core two‑handed method—driver passing needle, pickup/forceps stabilizing and managing suture—remains constant.

Working at the superior short incision and concentrated passes (120.0–164.0 s)
Around the middle portion of the recording the operator concentrates on a shorter vertical defect toward the upper/right corner of the pad — still the same right‑side incision area. The needle driver and long, rod‑like instruments are arranged roughly parallel to the wound in several frames, with the non‑dominant instrument sometimes laid across the wound to provide counter‑traction and guidance. Needle passes are short and controlled, oriented lateral‑to‑medial or medial‑to‑lateral depending on the approach angle, and the tips of the forceps routinely evert the edge prior to penetration. The operator organizes the suture loop carefully after each passage, pulling the suture through and preparing for knotting or the next throw.

At this stage, the pattern shows both interrupted bites and a line of closely spaced passes suggestive of either a continuous running approach or densely placed interrupted sutures. Frames explicitly depict a running pink suture line medially and additional stitches being placed laterally—indicating either augmentation of a running closure or serial interrupted placement matching the running pattern’s spacing. The operative motions include tensioning and dressing the suture loop, as well as positioning instruments for efficient next passes.

Advancing and finishing the superior segment (165.0–209.0 s)
Later in the sequence the operator works at the superior end of the same right‑side incision, making repeated short passes to advance what has been described at times as a continuous/serial closure. The needle driver presents a curved needle with a controlled rotating motion to approximate the superior edge with bites that mirror the spacing and depth of the existing stitch column. The opposing forceps lifts, everts and aligns the opposite edge while the driver passes and withdraws the needle. The suture tail is tensioned with the non‑dominant hand and the operator uses small coordinated motions to maintain even apposition along the superior segment.

Frames in this interval show the operator completing additional bites at the superior-most portion and then withdrawing the needle, suggesting either completion of a running pass or placement of the last interrupted stitch in a sequence. The hands remain within a few centimeters of one another, frequently approaching <1 cm separation at the exact bite site when tensioning the suture or preparing to tie. Instrument approach angles are consistent: the driver generally approaches obliquely from above/left while forceps stabilize from below/right.

Final securing, knotting and inspection (210.0–238.0 s)
In the concluding frames the operator finalizes the closure at the very top of the right‑sided incision. Actions observed include pulling suture tails to tension the line, performing locking/tying maneuvers (small rotations and instrument‑assisted throws), and trimming or manipulating the remaining stubs. The needle is withdrawn in these frames and the suture tension is adjusted with coordinated instrument movement. The operator uses bare fingers briefly in some frames to palpate or point near the central and left incisions, then returns to instrument‑based manipulation over the right wound apex.

By the last frames the incision edges are closely approximated along their entire visualized length. The previously visible spacing between bites has been reduced through the placement of additional stitches and final tensioning. The surface shows mild and consistent eversion at the wound margin—an intentional effect of the bite technique and edging—to optimize skin edge apposition as the suture settles. Instruments are removed from direct contact, and the operator inspects the line with short palpatory gestures and instrument repositioning.

Technique development and consistency throughout
Across the entire recording the operator employs a disciplined two‑handed suturing method: a needle driver handling a curved swaged needle with mid‑shaft-to‑distal grip and a toothed forceps providing tissue control, counter‑traction and suture management. Needle passes are short, controlled arcs directed to capture superficial dermis and epidermis with minimal inclusion of deep layers; the forceps frequently tent a small cuff of tissue to ensure accurate, shallow bites. Slight eversion of the edges is a recurring and deliberate element, used to optimize final surface apposition. Hands and instruments remain close to the wound throughout (commonly 1–4 cm separation) for precise control and coordinated movement.

There are iterative phases of work: initial placement at mid/lower portions, sequential advancement along the incision with repetitive passes, reinforcement adjacent to an existing medial column of stitches, and final bites and knot tying at the superior apex. The operator alternates between placing individual interrupted bites and advancing a continuous/serial line—frames sometimes describe discrete interrupted stitches and at other times a continuous running pink suture line being progressed. These observations are not mutually exclusive in the recorded sequence: the operator augments, mirrors or completes the existing stitch column while also adding individual bites as needed to achieve consistent spacing and tension.

Hand and instrument evolution
Throughout the procedure the relative hand roles remain complementary but flexible: the dominant hand primarily manipulates the needle and driver, while the non‑dominant hand stabilizes tissue and manages the suture. Occasionally the roles swap and the left hand assumes the driver while the right provides pickup/traction, but the bilateral coordination is constant. Instrument positions shift along the long axis of the incision as the operator progresses cranially (superiorly) — early work is concentrated at mid/lower segments, later activity concentrates at the superior end; at all times the instruments flank the incision, either approaching from opposite sides or crossing briefly during needle transfer and knot tying.

Spatial relationships remain tight around the working bite: instruments are commonly within a few centimeters of one another, often <1–2 cm during knot‑security maneuvers. The needle approach angle varies from perpendicular to slightly oblique, chosen to match the curvature of the needle and the desired bite depth. The non‑dominant instrument’s counter‑traction may be applied across the wound or laid across the pad when needed to stabilize prior suture loops.

Final state of the closure
By the end of the recording the right‑side vertical incision is uniformly approximated along the portion visualized. Multiple bites align in a contiguous column from superior to inferior, forming a continuous appearance where prior stitches had been present medially and new bites complete the lateral/ superior segments. Surface eversion is mild but consistent, and wound edges show close apposition with minimal gapping. The needle has been withdrawn, suture tails organized and shortened, and the operator performs a final inspection and brief palpation near the apex to confirm tension and alignment. Instruments are withdrawn from active manipulation, leaving a neat, evenly spaced line of suture along the right vertical incision.

Throughout the case the operator demonstrates controlled, consistent needle handling and tissue control: mid‑shaft needle grips, curved needle arcs, tenting of a small dermal cuff with toothed forceps, brief exteriorization and regrasping of the needle when required, and deliberate tensioning and knot securing at completion. While frames reflect both interrupted bites and the presence of a running/continuous column, the overall strategy is cohesive: sequentially place and secure closely spaced superficial bites to produce a continuous, well‑approximated closure on the right‑sided vertical incision.
