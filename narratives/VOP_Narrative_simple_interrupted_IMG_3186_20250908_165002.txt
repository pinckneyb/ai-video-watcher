COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
What follows is a continuous, chronological account of a single wound being managed: the vertical incision on the right side of the suture pad. From the first moments it is already partially closed with simple interrupted sutures. Over the course of the sequence the operator repeatedly prepares to add another stitch at the inferior portion, then turns to evaluate, tension, and trim existing throws. Although several set‑ups for a new stitch are staged, no additional stitch is actually passed through tissue and tied during the captured intervals. The line ends the sequence with the same four interrupted sutures it had at the outset.

The session opens with the right‑sided vertical incision in view. It runs superior to inferior near the pad’s right margin and already carries four evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures, their knots lying laterally off the wound edge and imparting mild eversion and approximation. The gaps remaining toward the inferior end are modest—enough to warrant another stitch to complete the closure. The right hand enters from the lower right with tissue forceps and lightly tents the right wound edge. The left hand comes in from above and to the left with a needle driver. The curved needle is picked up near the junction of its distal third and mid‑body and set in the jaws with the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin. The driver and forceps straddle the incision axis so the operator can work from either side of the wound without crossing instruments. The forceps’ teeth engage the dermal edge just enough to evert it, avoiding excessive crush. Orientation is consistent with a plan to take a conventional simple interrupted bite across the inferior end: a perpendicular approach, short controlled bites, and a trajectory that would carry the needle cleanly through the near edge and across to the far side if the pass were completed. In these early moments no pass is made; the motion is all about presentation—tissue exposure, driver angle, and alignment—so the next stitch can be placed with symmetry to the existing ones.

As the work continues, the roles of the hands briefly swap to chase better angles. The right hand now carries the needle driver, while the left alternates between Adson forceps and scissors as needed. The needle is re‑grasped on the body, this time about one‑third from the swaged end, again set perpendicular to the skin to preserve the natural arc of passage. The instruments move over the lower half of the right‑side incision, where a small gap remains. The forceps make gentle, intermittent approximations of the edges near that lower third, just enough to evaluate where the next throw should sit for even spacing. The driver’s tip and needle are then parked near the inferior end, poised for the first bite. Throughout this phase, the operator is meticulous about using the forceps for edge eversion rather than traction; he avoids “crushing” the epidermis, keeping the teeth just inside the dermal border. The four existing stitches remain in place and tied.

After this set‑up, there is a period devoted to housekeeping on the same right‑side wound. The forceps work up and down the line manipulating suture tails near the knots and briefly everting or compressing the edges to assess tension and edge alignment. The left hand brings in a needle holder or scissors from above, at times simply parked over the field and at other times used actively to tension or nip suture ends. No curved needle is engaged in tissue during this interlude—the activity is limited to tightening, minor adjustment of the slack at the knots, and trimming tails to leave them short and neat. When tension is applied along the line, the skin puckers slightly, indicating healthy tissue response and confirming that the knots are secure. Throughout, the count remains clear: four completed interrupted sutures run along the right incision; none are removed, and none are added.

With the line tidied, attention swings back to preparing another stitch at the distal end. The left hand once again holds a needle driver, hovering from the upper left over the right incision. The right hand alternates between Adson forceps and a second driver, working directly over the lower half of the line. The curved needle sits in the driver jaws at the proximal third, an orientation that gives the operator fine rotational control and a short working arc across a small gap. The needle and its attached suture remain outside the wound during this segment; the sequence captures repositioning and planning rather than penetration. The right‑hand forceps pick up the dermal margin at the inferior end to present a crisp entry site. At moments both hands bring two drivers together over the wound—either to transfer the needle to a more favorable grip or to simulate the tying step’s hand positions—further evidence of choreographing a simple interrupted placement without actually taking the bite. The existing sutures anchor the wound well enough that the edges are slightly everted even before any new throw is added. No new needle passage is seen; the four earlier ties still define the closure.

By the end of the session the surgeon lifts the curved needle into view with the right hand. The grasp is between the fingertips near the needle’s body, curve directed down and left, hovering above the superior portion of the same right‑sided incision. No instrument contacts the wound at this instant, and there’s no tissue grasping—this is a moment of poised readiness to continue the series of simple interrupted stitches. Along the right vertical line, four completed interrupted sutures remain evenly spaced with mild eversion, and the inferior gap targeted for the next stitch persists awaiting the next pass.

Suture progression and pattern across the sequence are straightforward. From the very first look at the line, four completed simple interrupted sutures are present. The operator’s focus is on finishing the inferior end with another evenly spaced throw that would mirror the spacing established above. Multiple preparatory actions confirm this intent: the needle is alternately grasped at different points along its body (near the distal third/middle, then one‑third from the swage, then at the proximal third) to optimize rotational control depending on hand position and angle of approach; the forceps repeatedly lift and evert the inferior margin to expose a precise entry point; at times, two drivers are brought together over the wound in classic tying or transfer positions. Despite these set‑ups, none of the captured scenes show the needle penetrating tissue or a knot being tied on this right‑sided incision. Consequently, the stitch count does not change during the captured windows.

Hand positions evolve logically as the operator adjusts to the wound’s geometry and to microscopic differences in angle and reach. Early on, the left hand is the driver hand coming from the upper left, while the right hand (from the lower right) uses Adson forceps to tent the near edge. This opposition across the wound gives excellent control and visibility for a perpendicular pass. When the driver shifts to the right hand, the left hand alternates between pickups and scissors; this switch likely aims to improve the line of sight and wrist mechanics for a bite at the lower third where the angle from the right side is more favorable. During the line‑maintenance interlude, the right hand continues to work with the forceps along the wound, while the left brings in scissors or a holder to tension and trim tails; the instruments at these moments sit very close to the wound, often just lateral to the suture line, with tips parallel to the skin surface to avoid nicking the knots. In the subsequent preparation phase, the left hand resumes as the driver hand from the superior‑left corner of the field while the right hand alternates between pickups and a second driver, and the two instruments occasionally meet above the wound to transfer the needle or simulate tying. In the final moment, the right hand alone holds the needle above the superior portion of the wound, with the left hand off frame. This hand choreography is entirely consistent with simple interrupted technique and shows a careful effort to maintain perpendicular needle orientation, stable tissue eversion, and symmetric spacing without traumatizing the skin.

Technique remains consistent throughout. The needle is always oriented perpendicular to the skin, a hallmark of atraumatic passage through the dermis to achieve balanced eversion. The operator uses the forceps sparingly to evert the edge rather than to pull; grasping is at the dermal margin with minimal crush. The driver grips adapt to the exact maneuver: near the distal third when threading the needle into the driver and staging, one‑third from the swage when planning deeper or more controlled arcs, and at the proximal third when fine rotation and a short arc are needed in tight spaces. When trimming, scissors are kept nearly parallel to the skin surface and used to cut tails short without endangering knots, a small but important detail that keeps the line tidy and reduces foreign‑body exposure without compromising security. The presence of two drivers at times above the wound indicates preparation for safe needle hand‑off or for the tying phase; in either case, the surgeon maintains a neat field without dropping the needle into the wound or letting it wander uncontrolled.

Spatial relationships are stable and safe. The incision lies on the right side of the pad; instruments approach from the left and right, opposing each other across the wound so there’s always counter‑tension during critical maneuvers. At the inferior end, where the next stitch is planned, the right hand’s pickups provide just‑enough lift of the near edge to expose a defined bite site; the driver arcs toward the midline from the contralateral side to preserve a ninety‑degree entry angle. When existing sutures are adjusted and tails trimmed, both tools hug the wound laterally, and the tips remain just beyond the skin edge to avoid cutting knots. Even when two drivers are brought into the field simultaneously, they remain organized and controlled, meeting above the wound and then separating cleanly. At the conclusion, a single right hand hovers superior‑right to the line with the curved needle in a gentle, controlled pinch—showing readiness to place another stitch under direct vision while keeping a safe working distance.

Suture count verification and final state:
- At the beginning of the captured work on this line, there are four completed interrupted sutures already present along the right‑sided incision.
- Throughout the procedure, no additional suture is passed through tissue and tied on this line; the operator repeatedly prepares but does not execute another placement within the captured intervals.
- At the end of the sequence, the right‑side incision still displays four completed interrupted sutures with mild, even eversion; the needle is visible above the wound poised for the next step.
- The procedure resulted in 4 completed sutures.

In sum, this segment documents meticulous preparation and maintenance of a partially closed right‑side incision: establishing optimal hand positions and needle grips for a perpendicular bite at the inferior end, intermittently tensioning and trimming existing stitches to refine the line, and finally staging for the next throw. The wound is consistently well‑approximated by four simple interrupted sutures, their spacing and eversion preserved from start to finish, with the surgeon’s hands and instruments moving in a disciplined, symmetric pattern across the wound to protect tissue and set up the next step.
