COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire procedure focuses on closing a single wound: the rightmost vertical incision on the synthetic skin pad, positioned along the pad’s right edge. The other two parallel slits are never manipulated. Over the course of the sequence, the operator works consistently on this same line from its lower end toward the top, methodically building a line of stitches until the wound is largely approximated. The work shows careful control of the needle, disciplined handling of the tissue edges, and deliberate instrument choreography that evolves as the closure advances.

The closure begins at the inferior end of this rightmost incision. The left hand is the primary driver of the needle; it holds a needle driver with the curved needle loaded near the proximal third from the swage, giving the operator a robust arc for a perpendicular entry. The right hand stands opposite with Adson or similar tissue forceps. The two hands straddle the wound, their tips meeting over the gap. The right hand everts and steadies the near edge, exposing a consistent dermal purchase a few millimeters from the cut margin. The left hand then sweeps the needle through with controlled wrist rotation, following the curvature to aim squarely across the wound. The arc is perpendicular to the skin surface, and as the needle tip emerges on the far side, the forceps transition to control and then release the needle, letting the driver regrip for controlled extraction. The suture is pulled through to clear slack, leaving a tail draped inferiorly. At this early stage, passes are being made but no knot is tied yet; the sequence shows clean entry and exit with symmetric depth and a brief eversion of the far edge, but the stitch remains untied as the operator continues to position the suture and prepare for the next pass.

As the early work proceeds, the operator remains faithful to this same inferior portion of the rightmost incision. The left hand’s needle driver remains centered or just left of the line; the right hand’s forceps hold the right wound edge for entry, then move to the opposite side to guide the exit. This back-and-forth, tip-to-tip choreography gives good visualization of each pass and paces the suture through gently to avoid strangulation. Throughout, the needle is consistently held at the proximal to mid-third, conferring torque control while minimizing tissue trauma at the tip. The suture tail is kept out of the way and angled inferiorly. Early frames repeatedly demonstrate the first bite at the lower end: entry a few millimeters from the cut edge, perpendicular passage, symmetric exit, and smooth draw-through. These steps emphasize precision and repeatability in bite placement and depth.

Shortly afterward, the view expands to show that at some point a single completed stitch is visible elsewhere along this same wound, near the superior portion. That solitary knot does not change the operative focus—the attention remains on the lower end—but it confirms the first secured stitch has been established on this line. The hands continue to work at the bottom: the right hand lifts and everts the targeted edge, the needle driver crosses from the left, and the needle is driven through the right edge and across to the left. The instruments cross above the wound as the needle exits, and the suture tail trails onto the field. The procedural rhythm is clear: place the bite, guide the exit with forceps, draw the strand through, and reset the driver for the next arc. These frames consistently show manipulation of only the cutaneous edges—no deep tissue handling—and gentle traction to begin approximating the wound without crushing.

There is a brief interlude in which the right hand picks up a needle driver and the left hand holds scissors before the left hand again retrieves a needle driver and the right hand returns to forceps. This moment demonstrates that when needed, the dominant role can switch to accommodate repositioning the needle or trimming ends, but the operative plan remains unchanged: the needle driver and forceps oppose one another across the same rightmost incision, and the next bite is taken at its inferior end. A free suture strand is seen emerging from a small puncture at the near (right) wound edge; the right hand manages this strand and helps present the tissue while the left hand positions the needle for the next pass. Even as the hands switch tools briefly, the basic geometry is preserved: the driver works from just left of the wound and the forceps from the right edge, with tips converging at the bite site.

As these early arcs accumulate, the lower end of the wound begins to demonstrate approximation, though at first, there are no tied knots visible in that field of view. Soon afterward, the first fully secured stitch at the lower end is evident. With that anchor in place, the operator proceeds to place the next stitch a short distance superior to the first. The right wound edge is lifted and everted to present the dermis; the needle is loaded to pass right-to-left, and the forceps cross to the opposite side to assist the exit. Traction on the strand draws it through and begins to bring the wound edges toward alignment. These steps again stress perpendicular needle orientation, consistent entry distances from the cut edge, and symmetric depth on each side, all elements that encourage proper edge eversion and even spacing.

Once the lower anchor is in place, the number of completed stitches starts to increase steadily. The operator tightens a prior knot in the lower-middle portion and then advances to place a new bite just above it. Forceps lift and evert one edge, then the other, while the driver brings the needle across with short, controlled arcs. The suture is drawn through and tensioned just enough to approximate without blanching the edge. At this stage, two completed stitches are visible along the lower half, and the wound below them lies flatter and better aligned than the open portions above. The spacing is even, and the entry/exit symmetry remains consistent.

The work now climbs gradually toward the middle and superior portions. With three completed stitches visible along the lower half, the same pattern is repeated: needle driver just left of the line, forceps on the right, a perpendicular pass across the gap, and methodical traction to remove slack. The right hand steadily presents whichever edge is being penetrated or exited, briefly everting the margin to protect the epidermis and favor dermal purchase. The left hand’s driver makes small regrips when needed to adjust the needle angle, preserving a clean arc that maintains perpendicularity to the skin surface. The suture line is becoming a regular ladder of evenly spaced throws that tame the gaping edges and begin to create mild, deliberate eversion.

As the activity reaches the upper half, three secure stitches are present and a fourth is being added. The right hand alternates sides to stabilize the edge for each pass; the left hand advances the needle and then uses the driver to help tie. Tying begins near the end of this step and is completed in the next sequence, bringing the total of secured stitches to four. The edges in this zone show slight puckering between knots, consistent with appropriate tension and the small dermal bites used to control the margin. The instruments remain close and parallel to the incision, the driver slightly left/superior and the forceps slightly right/superior around each stitch site. The operator maintains a short working distance of just a few millimeters between instrument tips, avoiding sweeping motions that could tear synthetic tissue.

The next advance brings the count to five completed stitches. The right hand, still with forceps, presents the superior edge; the left hand drives the needle through the far edge and retrieves it through the near edge, maintaining the clean, perpendicular path. The suture is pulled through and laid across the wound with a neat loop. The small ridges that develop as stitches accumulate are expected on synthetic skin, signaling consistent dermal capture and mild eversion. The spacing remains regular, and the stitch line has progressed from the lower third through the midline, approaching the superior end.

At the top end, the operator continues the same steps, now working within one to two centimeters of the wound’s superior corner. The left hand keeps the driver slightly lateral to the line, and the right hand uses forceps both to stabilize tissue and to reposition the needle when needed. A new bite is placed at the top corner, the driver following the needle’s curvature with deliberate pronation and supination. The suture is snugged to lend approximation and remove slack from the line below. At this point, six completed bites are clearly visible along the wound. The edges lie approximated, with mild puckering that reflects the small, closely spaced dermal captures along the line. The superior end now receives the next pass, and the operator begins loop management to set up the finish.

Near the very end, the hands work even closer together at the superior tip. The right hand alternates from forceps to assist loop handling and tensioning, sometimes bringing in a second driver to facilitate instrument ties. At one point the left hand holds the driver for the tie while the right hand controls the free end and then brings in scissors briefly to trim. The passes are short and precise, and the line of stitches from inferior to superior is continuous in appearance, with each bite sitting close to its neighbors to maintain edge alignment. A terminal bite is placed and the operator starts to secure it. The next glimpse shows another pass at the top being tensioned, with the needle and thread momentarily set to the right of the board once pulled through.

Throughout the procedure, the hand positions evolve but remain faithful to the wound’s geometry. Early on, the left hand almost exclusively serves as the needle driver while the right hand handles tissue with forceps, everting edges and guiding the needle tip during exits. Midway, the right hand briefly takes over the driver and the left hand holds scissors before the left hand again assumes primary needle control. Later, as the closure reaches the top, both hands crowd the superior end for knot management, with the right hand alternately assisting with loop transfers, suture tension, and occasional instrument tie maneuvers, and then moving lateral to cut a tail. The instruments consistently oppose one another across the wound, tips meeting over the bite site, and the needle is repeatedly held at the proximal-to-mid third with a perpendicular approach to the skin.

The tissue handling remains conservative throughout. Only the cutaneous edges are grasped; the forceps lift the dermis just enough to present a safe, even bite a few millimeters from the margin. The needle driver advances the needle across with a small arc, and the suture is drawn through smoothly to avoid sawing. The operator keeps tension modest—firm enough to approximate and evert without strangulation. As stitches accumulate, the wound edges become progressively aligned, with mild puckering and slight elevation typical of closely spaced dermal captures on synthetic skin.

Counted over time, the number of secured stitches rises in a stepwise fashion. It begins with no completed stitches at the very start as initial passes are demonstrated at the inferior end. The first fully secured stitch is then evident; subsequent work adds to that foundation. The lower half achieves two secure stitches, then three, and tying of a fourth follows. Advancing toward the top, a fifth stitch is completed, and then a sixth. The superior end then receives another pass that is pulled through and tensioned. Although some descriptions later in the sequence characterize the overall appearance as a continuous line of bites near the end, there are moments where a fresh pass at the superior corner is not yet tied, indicating that not every pass seen is secured at that instant. This is consistent with the final frames, which show the suture pulled through at the top with tensioning underway but without the knot actually thrown within those frames.

Mandatory suture count verification:
- By the end of the procedure, six completed stitches are visible along the rightmost vertical incision. This is the exact count shown in the final frames.
- The count evolves as follows: it starts at zero while the first bites are placed at the lower end; it increases to one once the first stitch is secured; it grows to two and then three along the lower half; a fourth is tied as work moves upward; a fifth is added; and a sixth is visible as the operator works at the superior end. A subsequent top pass is made and tensioned, but because it is not tied within the final frames, it does not increase the tally of completed stitches beyond six.
- Final state: six completed stitches span the incision with slight, regular puckering and visible edge eversion. A new pass at the superior end has been pulled through and tensioned, but no final knot is thrown within the last view.

A few annotation details within the sequence appear to conflict—for example, there are moments where an early frame shows a single knot present near the top even as other frames in the same early interval depict the very first bites being placed at the bottom; similarly, the late sequence alternately describes a continuous line and then shows a fresh pass at the top without a visible tie. These inconsistencies do not alter the overall assessment or the continuous focus on one incision. The work stays on the same rightmost vertical wound from start to finish, progressing from its inferior end toward the superior end with controlled, perpendicular needle passes, conscientious edge eversion, and steady approximation.

In summary, the operator closes the rightmost vertical incision exclusively, building a clean, evenly spaced line of stitches from bottom to top. The needle is consistently grasped near the proximal-to-mid third, aligned perpendicular to the skin, and driven with controlled arcs. The right hand’s forceps provide precise edge control and eversion, and both hands coordinate to pass and retrieve the needle, manage loops, take up slack, tie where needed, and cut when complete. The closure advances in a measured pattern, steadily increasing the number of secured stitches. The procedure results in six completed stitches visible at the end, with the edges approximated and mildly everted; a final pass at the top is present and tensioned but remains untied within the last frames, keeping the confirmed total at six.
