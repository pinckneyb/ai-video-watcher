============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on the rightmost of three parallel vertical incisions on a synthetic skin pad, the one closest to the right edge and marked by terminal dots. The two central lines remain unused throughout and are disregarded. From start to finish, every maneuver, needle pass, tie, and instrument exchange is focused on bringing together the edges of this single right-sided incision, progressing from its inferior end upward, with technique and hand positioning adapting to maintain accuracy, tissue protection, and a consistent path of closure.

The work begins at the lower end of the right incision. The left hand holds a needle driver, the right hand a pair of red-handled tissue forceps. With the needle grasped at its proximal third and presented perpendicular to the skin surface, the driver advances at the lower right target dot. The forceps gently lift and evert the right wound edge to present dermis and protect tissue as the needle enters. The driver follows the needle’s curved arc across the incision, and the right hand transitions to the far side to guide the exit and pull-through. The suture is drawn across cleanly, with the strand trailing to the right to keep the field clear. In the next moments the scene shows the second pass beginning: the needle is directed once more perpendicular to the skin, the forceps stabilizing the near/right edge while the driver follows the arc across to the far side. The needle driver approaches from the upper-left of the field toward this right-sided incision, crossing diagonally and then straightening as the tip follows its curvature through the dermis. The pickups assist in guiding and stabilizing the needle as it emerges, carefully avoiding crushing tissue. Through these early sequences the edges are handled delicately and bites are placed close to the marked line for alignment.

Before another penetration, the instruments pause for suture management at the inferior end. The driver is briefly oriented vertically to reestablish a stable needle grasp; the right-hand forceps manipulate the suture and maintain exposure. No new tissue pass is made in this moment—tension is adjusted, slack is removed, and the next pass is prepared, still at the lower portion. Then the driver advances a fresh entry from the right edge toward the left, again perpendicular to the skin surface. The right hand lifts and everts the near edge, the needle crosses the wound smoothly in an arc, and the edges begin to draw together.

Attention then shifts to securing the work at this inferior end. The left hand continues to hold the driver, now serving as the tying instrument. The right hand posts the short tail with the forceps. A series of instrument throws is laid down over the right-sided post, each throw cinched with the long limb pulled across the field from left to right. The knot stack seats directly at the lower third of the incision. Throughout, the needle is parked safely while tying is completed. The resulting knot cluster sits just lateral to the cut line on the right, with fresh suture tails visible—a stable base for continued closure above.

With that anchor secure, a fresh needle–suture assembly is introduced from the upper left. The left hand again carries the needle driver over the superior half of the same right incision, presenting the needle perpendicular to the skin. The right hand remains lateral to the wound with forceps ready to evert and control tissue. The next bite is prepared with the needle aiming to enter the right edge and traverse to the left. For this sequence the driver is briefly in the right hand, underscoring that the operator alternates hand roles as needed for ergonomics and line-of-sight: the right hand brings the driver in over the right side, while the left-hand forceps lift and evert the edge. After some fine adjustments, reloading, and tensioning of previously placed loops, a new pass is completed. The needle is grasped roughly a third of its length back from the swage, the jaws perpendicular to the needle’s curvature, and the driver follows the arc across to achieve a symmetrical bite. The right-hand forceps steady the exit and assist in pulling through, maintaining even edge approximation with slight eversion.

Progress builds steadily up the incision. Several sequences show slack being removed and previously placed loops being snugged without crushing the skin edges. The operator repeatedly regrips the needle in the driver to maintain a perpendicular approach and an efficient arc of travel. The suture strand is kept to the right side to avoid tangling and to maintain a consistent vector for tightening. When ties are formed, the driver alternates positions above the wound to place and seat the knot stacks directly over the incision line, with the forceps controlling the free end or acting as a post. Knot tails lie to the right of the wound, and trimming occurs after they are stable and out of the way of upcoming passes.

As the closure proceeds upward, the roles of the hands continue to adapt. In some sequences the right hand carries the needle driver, approaching from the lateral side, while the left hand uses forceps from the medial side to present the dermis. In others, the left hand runs the driver from a superior-left trajectory, with the right hand staying lateral to lift the right edge or retrieve the needle. Each bite is prepared with the tip perpendicular to the skin, the forceps providing just enough traction to evert the margin and expose the dermis without excessive pressure. The edges come together in measured increments, and the line shows consistent spacing and mild eversion, matching the architecture of earlier stitches.

Midway through the procedure the inferior and mid segments have several knots seated on the right side with intervening segments approximated. The operator occasionally pauses to trim the tails of the most recently tied knot using scissors brought briefly into the field, then returns to the driver and forceps. Another pass begins at a point just proximal to the last tied stitch. The curved needle is reloaded—often at the proximal third to mid-body—and aligned perpendicular to the surface. The right-hand forceps lift the near edge; the driver follows the arc through one margin and then through the opposite, retrieving the needle on exit and controlling the path with the forceps to avoid tearing.

Near the upper third of the incision, the operator increases the cadence of pass–pull-through–reset. Bites are taken across the wound with consistent spacing, and suture is drawn through after each pass while the forceps lift and control the edge to ensure precise entry and exit locations. Hands work in opposition across the wound: the driver from the superior-left side or lateral-right side depending on the angle, the forceps from the contralateral side. After each pass the suture is pulled laterally to the right to clear the field and to set the stitch before the next one is taken. The needle is repeatedly reloaded to maintain an optimal orientation—grasped at the proximal third or just distal to the midpoint—so that entry points remain perpendicular and arcs are controlled.

Approaching the most superior segment, the driver hovers above the next intended bite site while the forceps lift the right edge. A new bite is completed and the suture pulled through. The needle is then parked superior-right while the operator tensions the strand to bring the edges together at the apex. The field shows a neat series of approximated bites below, with the more central lines of the pad untouched.

In the final phase, the closure shows a short run at the top executed in a continuous locking fashion, recognizable by the small lateral loops that form as the suture is drawn laterally to the right before the next pass. After each pass, the long limb is pulled to the right to snug the loop and secure the lock at the wound edge, producing a series of consistent external loops along the right margin without excessive strangulation of tissue. The left hand with the needle driver remains just medial and slightly superior to the working bite, while the right hand with the forceps stabilizes the edge and briefly releases to pull on the free strand to tighten. The rhythm becomes pass, lock, tension; pass, lock, tension—edges are maintained in good apposition with mild, uniform eversion. Throughout, the suture is managed laterally so it never obscures the next planned entry point. Once this short locking run is adequately seated, there is a brief period of final tightening and seating of the throws. The needle is then parked and scissors are brought in for trimming. The hands mirror each other with scissors for a moment while the extra strand is cut flush enough to be tidy but not so short as to risk unraveling.

Across the entire procedure, instrument choreography remains consistent despite occasional hand role changes. The driver always presents the needle perpendicular to the skin and follows the needle’s curvature to minimize tissue trauma; the forceps lift and evert just enough to show dermis and guide the needle’s tip; and the suture is kept to the right side of the wound, where knots, loops, and tails live away from the working axis. The driver routinely regrips the needle between throws to preserve optimal needle orientation, and the forceps frequently regrip tissue and occasionally the needle itself for safe transfer. When tying, the driver becomes the tying instrument, placing instrument knots with the right-hand forceps serving as a post on the short tail. Tails are trimmed only after the line is secure and the next segment will not be impeded.

It bears noting that early on the inferior portion shows discrete knot clusters characteristic of intermittent tying at each stitch, while the superior end culminates in a short locking sequence with lateral loops: the visual blend of discrete knots and a locking run reflects a progression that anchors the line securely at the bottom, builds a series of well-spaced passes upward, and then finishes the top segment as a short continuous lockup for efficient, even approximation. The technique remains coherent throughout, with bites perpendicular to the skin, edges everted and aligned, and the suture consistently managed laterally to the right. Any appearance of isolated knots midway is handled as secure anchoring within the same closure plan, and these are integrated seamlessly into the final line.

By the end, the rightmost incision is neatly approximated from the inferior end into the upper segment. A series of evenly spaced stitches lies along the wound, with knot stacks and locking loops consistently positioned on the right/lateral side. The edges are gently everted with minimal gapping and no evidence of tissue crush or tearing. The superior segment’s short locking run is snugged and seated, the surplus suture tails are trimmed, and the needle is parked out of the operative path. The result is a tidy, secure closure on the right-sided incision, achieved through deliberate passes, meticulous tissue handling, and disciplined suture management, while the two central incisions remain unmanipulated throughout.
