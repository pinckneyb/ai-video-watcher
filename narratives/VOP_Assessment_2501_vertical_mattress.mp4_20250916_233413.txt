Pattern: Vertical Mattress

Summative assessment:
Four completed sutures close the wound with acceptable alignment and generally gentle handling. Knot quality and perpendicular needle control are competent, and spacing is serviceable though not fully uniform. However, this does not meet vertical mattress standards. The essential far-far then near-near layering was not performed, so deep support and deliberate eversion were lacking and knots were not lateralized. To meet the vertical mattress standard, take a deep far bite 5–8 mm from the edge on each side, then return with shallow near bites 2–3 mm from the edge, maintaining perpendicularity and lateralizing the knot. Standardize spacing at 5–10 mm, achieve a consistent eversion ridge without blanching, and streamline motion by minimizing instrument swaps and unnecessary departures.
