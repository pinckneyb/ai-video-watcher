Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
This was a controlled, methodical execution with clean perpendicular passes and reliable hand-to-hand coordination during instrument ties. The rhythm was deliberate: pass, pull-through, instrument tie with opposing tension, then move to the next stitch. Parking the needle and introducing scissors only when trimming supported a tidy field and preserved flow.
