COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a synthetic suture training pad bearing several parallel vertical slits, but all operative attention remains focused on a single short vertical cut positioned in the upper-left quadrant of the field, just left of center near the superior aspect of the pad. From the outset to the final moments when the working area moves off camera, the operator steadily builds a line of interrupted closures along this one incision, advancing and securing each stitch with instrument ties, then trimming tails as the closure consolidates.

The first sequence shows the beginning of the closure. With the wound clearly identified, the left hand controls a needle driver while the right hand uses tissue forceps to present the edges. The needle is held correctly at the junction of its proximal third and middle third, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. The right-hand forceps gently evert the left margin to expose the dermis and define entry spacing a few millimeters from the edge. The needle tip is aligned and driven following its curvature, advancing across the wound from the left side with a smooth wrist rotation. The forceps then shift to the right wound edge to present the opposite side for the through-and-through passage. The suture is pulled through, establishing the first placement on this incision without tying just yet. The scene quickly transitions into knot formation: the needle is not driven further; instead, the left-hand instrument serves as the tying tool, and the right hand feeds and manages the free end. Loops are formed around the driver, the short end is grasped and delivered, and the knot is advanced down the suture track, cinching directly over the wound. As tension is applied, the slit edges approximate with slight, controlled puckering, indicating appropriate apposition without excess strangulation. Successive throws are alternated in direction to square the knot and secure the stitch. Once seated, the operator brings scissors to cut the tails close to the knot, completing the first closure element on this line.

The next pass is set up immediately. The left hand again holds the needle driver; the right hand, now with fine forceps, stabilizes the opposite side. The needle is reloaded in the driver at about two-thirds from the tip, and its orientation is reset perpendicular to the skin. The tip is aimed at the left margin near the wound’s superior half, while the forceps on the right define an exit point across the slit, opposing the intended entry to keep bites symmetric. A shallow, consistent bite is taken on each side, preserving dermal alignment. The suture is drawn through, and the needle is then kept away from tissue during tying to avoid catching the skin or glove. Instrument ties follow the same sequence as before: the right hand loops the long limb around the driver, the short end is grasped, and the throw is snugged down over the wound. Throws are alternated to square the knot; edges are gently approximated and mildly everted. The tails remain temporarily uncut to allow the operator to maintain control while the next step is prepared. A brief interlude follows where the right hand stabilizes the tails and an instrument approaches to trim, confirming the completion of that stitch before moving on.

With two knots now seated on the left-side incision, the operator advances up the line. At this stage, the left hand maintains the driver just superior-left of the wound, and the right hand alternates between forceps and directly controlling the suture tail. The needle remains correctly grasped two-thirds from the tip, presented perpendicular to the skin, and is driven in a smooth, arcing motion. Bites remain shallow and symmetric; the right-hand forceps alternately grasp each margin near the dermal edge to produce slight eversion and to standardize bite spacing. After each passage, the suture is pulled through, the needle is parked and kept away from the tissue, and instrument throws are formed to secure the knot. The operator displays good suture management: short working distances are maintained, the long limb is kept oriented away from the wound during tie formation, and the throws are seated directly over the incision with gentle, progressive traction. As each knot is secured, the scissors return to trim tails close to the knot stack, tidy the line, and prepare for the next passage.

The technique remains consistent yet adapts fluidly to situational needs. During one sequence, the right hand uses gloved fingertips instead of forceps to hold the free end and modulate loop tension while the left-hand driver forms throws—this substitution keeps the line steady and the view clear as the knot is seated. At other times, the right hand reintroduces forceps to present the next tissue bite, especially when slight eversion is needed for clean entry angles. The operator is careful to maintain perpendicular entry and follows the needle’s curvature, minimizing the risk of overshooting or creating asymmetrical bites that could roll the edges inward. The wound edges behave as expected on synthetic skin, showing gentle approximation and slight puckering as each knot is tightened—evidence of adequate, not excessive, tension.

Progress moves steadily toward the superior end of the incision. Early in the mid-procedure, the left vertical slit shows several closely spaced stitches approximating much of the wound, with a small residual gap toward the top that becomes the next target. The operator places a new stitch at this superior segment: left-hand driver on the near side, right-hand forceps on the far side, eversion achieved with precise pinching of the dermal margin. The needle enters a few millimeters from the edge and follows an arcing trajectory across the wound. After the second bite and suture pull-through, tying begins immediately. The driver is used to loop, grasp, and seat alternating throws, with the right hand either managing the tail or stabilizing tissue. Consistent with the earlier steps, the needle is kept out of the wound’s path during tying, enhancing safety and preventing inadvertent tissue snags.

As more stitches are added along the same slit, occasional brief segments show consolidation rather than new placement: the right hand pinches suture tails to snug down a recently tied knot, aligning the knot stack along the left edge; then scissors or a scissor-like needle holder trims excess tails. At one point, the operator moves along the line from superior to inferior, inspecting each knot and cutting tails to uniform length. This sequence of trimming demonstrates a methodical finalization phase—first confirm each knot is seated and tensioned, then tidy the line for a clean finish. During these finishing passes, the instrument tips remain aligned perpendicular to the incision to avoid nicking the tissue and to produce consistent tail length.

Between these cycles of placement and trimming, there are moments of preparation and positioning without immediate penetration of tissue. The needle holder hovers at the superior margin, opening and closing near the target zone, aligning angles for the next bite, while the assistant hand stabilizes the pad or lightly presents the edge. In one such sequence, scissors first return to shorten tails on the most superior knot, and then the driver takes position as if for the next pass; however, the actual penetration is not captured in that interval. Despite these pauses, the continuity of the closure is clear: all manipulation remains at the same short left-side slit, and the technique is consistent with successive simple, symmetric passes, followed by instrument ties and standardized tail trimming.

Midway through the closure, the operator’s hand positions evolve slightly with the wound’s contour. Initially, forceps are used almost every time to present a crisp edge; later, the operator alternates between forceps and fingertip control of the free strand, depending on whether a bite or a tie is underway. The needle is consistently grasped at the proximal third to middle third junction and held perpendicular to the driver jaws, optimizing control as the needle follows its arc through the dermis. The right hand frequently crosses over the wound to deliver the short end to the driver during instrument ties, and then retracts to maintain counter-tension while the driver seats the knot. The driver’s tip stays close to the wound but is lifted just slightly during the cinch to avoid burying the knot too deeply or dragging tissue.

Later frames show primarily adjustment and completion steps on this left-side incision. The operator checks the line’s superior portion, where prior frames had shown mild residual separation, and addresses it with additional passes and secure tying. As the series of knots increases along the vertical slit, the wound edges are drawn progressively more flush, with slight eversion particularly where forceps were used to present the dermal edge. Mild puckering around knots indicates appropriate tension rather than strangulation, and the spacing between stitches appears short and regular, maintaining alignment along the wound axis. The cutting instrument then moves systematically along the line from top to bottom, trimming any long tails. During these finalizing moves, hands work millimeters from the incision, and the driver and scissors remain parallel or perpendicular to the wound as appropriate to maintain clarity and safety.

In the final minutes, there are intervals where the camera shows no active manipulation. The pad is in view with multiple slits visible, but no hands or instruments are working; the short midline slit appears briefly with small puncture marks and slight gaping, yet remains untouched. This is a non-operative interlude—no new bites, throws, or trimming occurs. Subsequently, a gloved hand moves across the frame and lifts the pad, momentarily displaying the central incision as the entire board is relocated. There is still no suturing at that central site; the earlier left-side closure remains the only site that had been actively managed throughout the procedure. The final frames show the work surface without the pad, then a blue instrument board with a couple of white rods and a metal component—evidence of wrap-up and tray organization rather than ongoing operative work.

Across the entire session, the technique is consistent. Each stitch is placed with the needle perpendicular to the skin, bites are small and symmetric on both sides of the slit, and the needle’s curvature is respected to avoid skiving or tearing. The forceps are used judiciously to lift and evert edges without crushing tissue. Knots are formed with instrument ties: loops are alternated, and tension is applied evenly to seat each throw centrally over the wound. The needle is deliberately parked away from the wound during tying to prevent accidental catching of the skin or glove, and suture tails are trimmed only after the knot is confirmed secure. Hand positioning remains stable and ergonomic: the driver generally approaches from the left with the right hand opposite, and when roles shift—for example, when the right hand pinches the suture tail instead of wielding forceps—the overall relationship to the wound remains balanced and controlled.

By the time the operative focus ceases and the pad is moved off camera, the short left-side incision has been converted from a gaping slit into a neatly approximated line with closely spaced interrupted knots. The superior portion, which initially showed a mild gap, has been addressed with additional passes and secure tying. The knot stack lies consistently to one side, tail lengths are trimmed to uniform short stubs, and the wound edges demonstrate gentle eversion with minimal residual puckering. No further bites are added after the completion and trimming sequences near the end; subsequent footage shows no return to this site. The final appearance suggests a completed interrupted closure of the short vertical incision, with adequate edge apposition and tension, and with the field cleared and instruments set aside as the session concludes.
