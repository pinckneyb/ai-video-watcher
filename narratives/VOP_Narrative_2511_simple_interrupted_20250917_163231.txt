COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The recording opens on a quiet field: a synthetic skin pad centered on a wooden base with a ruler at the top and three parallel vertical incisions—left, center, and right—running down the middle of the pad. For an extended interval, no hands or instruments enter. The central slit carries faint midline marks suggestive of previous practice, but none of the wounds are manipulated, and no suture threads, knots, or partial passes are visible. The edges of all three incisions are slightly gaped, lying flat without eversion or traction. During these early minutes, the view remains static; because there is no operative activity, the working line cannot be verified in the moment. Only at the very end of this preparatory period does a gloved hand flicker into view above the field, without engaging the tissue.

The operative sequence begins at the lower-right quadrant of the pad and immediately clarifies the target: work is focused on the short vertical slit nearest the pad’s right edge. The right hand presents a needle driver over the inferior end of this right-sided incision, while the left hand brings in Adson-style tissue forceps to stabilize the near (patient’s right) wound edge. The curved needle is mounted in the driver approximately at the proximal-to-mid third of the arc and presented perpendicular to the pad surface. Following good form, the driver uses wrist rotation to advance the needle through the right dermal edge at the inferior portion of the wound, engaging the tissue in a controlled arc rather than pushing straight. The forceps provide gentle eversion and counter-tension, lifting the margin so the needle enters cleanly and follows its curvature. This initiates the first stitch at the base of the right vertical incision.

With the first bite set, the roles of the hands define an early pattern that will persist throughout the case. At times the left hand becomes the driver hand and the right hand assumes the forceps; at other times the right hand drives while the left hand exposes. Regardless of which hand holds which instrument, the instruments oppose each other across the wound: the driver centers over the slit to deliver the needle perpendicularly; the forceps flank the edge to control tissue and needle exit, and to hand off the needle when necessary. After traversing the incision from right to left, the suture is pulled through and the driver regrips the needle to maintain control. The operator transitions into instrument ties over the inferior end of the wound, forming throws and cinching the knot neatly onto the incision. The knot lands flush with the surface without strangulating the synthetic skin; short tails are left on the patient’s right side of the wound, establishing a consistent knot orientation that will recur along the line.

With an anchor in place at the lower edge, the work progresses immediately adjacent to this first stitch. The driver reorients the needle perpendicular to the surface for the next pass near the previously placed knot. The forceps elevate the right margin, and the needle is driven in a smooth arc across the slit. Throughout these sequences, the operator demonstrates consistent needle handling: grasping at the proximal third to mid-body, perpendicular entry to minimize tearing, and periodic regripping to maintain optimal needle angle as it exits the far side. Once the suture is through, the strand is tensioned to approximate the edges, then looped for instrument ties. The knot is seated gently but definitively, preserving slight eversion at the wound margins. In the lower third of the incision, the operator alternates between placing a pass, drawing the suture through, and securing it with instrument ties; scissors or a thread-cutting/burning device are then brought in to trim tails close to the knot. The knot stacks and short tails consistently lie toward the patient’s right, lending a uniform look to the closure as it ascends from inferior to superior.

As the stitches advance from the lower toward the mid-portion of the wound, the working triangle remains disciplined. The driver works over the wound axis; the forceps operate a few millimeters lateral to the target bite, everting and presenting the dermal margin for precise entry and exit. The suture strand is kept to the side—often drawn laterally to the right or arcing superiorly and leftward—to clear the field and avoid entanglement. When passing through thicker portions of the material, the driver uses supination and pronation to turn the needle through the tissue; the forceps occasionally grasp the needle tip as it appears to guide it out smoothly, preventing undue drag or skin distortion. The result is a series of evenly spaced, symmetric bites that align cleanly with the wound axis and approximate the edges without crushing them. After each pass, the operator transitions to tying: instrument ties are formed with the driver opposing another instrument or the assisting hand, and each knot is cinched down on the incision with care. Scissors then approach from the patient’s right to trim tails, which are left short and tidy.

In the middle segment of the repair, a brief interval is devoted purely to knot security rather than new bites. The driver manipulates the suture, forming loops and advancing them down in a controlled manner, while the forceps maintain gentle edge alignment. No additional tissue penetration occurs during these specific frames; they serve to finish and seat the stitch that was just passed. This pattern—pass, pull-through, tie, trim—cycles consistently, and the closure line lengthens. The lower half of the wound now displays several completed stitches with slight eversion and approximation. At one point, the right hand momentarily stabilizes the pad surface rather than the wound edge, confirming that the approximated stitches themselves are maintaining alignment without supplemental traction.

As the operator moves into the upper half of the incision, the technique remains coherent and precise. The needle driver—now in the left hand in many frames—returns to a perpendicular approach with the forceps on the patient’s right. The pair of instruments work in counterpoint across the wound: the forceps lift and expose each edge in turn, the needle dips in at a proper setback and depth, and the driver rotates the arc through the tissue to emerge reliably on the far side. The suture is drawn through, bringing the edges neatly together; the driver releases and regrips the needle as needed to maintain control without torquing the tissue. At this stage, the completed stitches below maintain apposition, while newly placed stitches extend the closure line superiorly. In several sequences, the camera captures the driver using a gold‑handled instrument and the forceps with a yellow mark—reliable identifiers of instrument roles as they alternate sides to maintain ideal approach angles for successive bites.

Knotting and trimming continue to punctuate the sequence. Once a pass is completed at the superior end being worked, the suture is tensioned and a series of instrument ties is formed. The knots are cinched down over the incision and tails cut flush, preserving both security and a clean field. The operator is careful not to rock or crush the tissue while setting the knot; tension is firm but measured, ensuring that eversion is maintained and ischemia avoided. In a couple of brief interludes, no needle passage occurs; instead, the driver holds the suture to snug a knot down, or the scissors enter to clip excess. These pauses underscore a methodical cadence: every stitch is fully completed and tidied before the next is started.

Throughout, the spatial relationships remain consistent despite subtle hand-switching. The driver habitually centers above the wound segment being addressed, while the assisting hand opposes it laterally. Approaches are perpendicular, and regripping is used rather than changing entry angles mid-pass. When the suture is pulled through, the long working end is managed away from the wound—often trailing to the right or superior-left—to prevent obscuring the field. The instruments maintain a few millimeters’ separation over the wound, creating a predictable working triangle that keeps the needle path clear and the tissue supported. As the line progresses, the previously placed stitches provide intrinsic alignment, allowing the forceps to use lighter grasps for eversion and exposure, and reducing the need for aggressive traction.

One short sequence presents a visual anomaly: the incision appears horizontal, and work proceeds on its right half with a stitch completed and tails cut before the needle is reloaded near the midline. Given the uninterrupted continuity of instruments, technique, and surrounding field, this moment likely reflects a camera rotation or a brief misframing of the same right-side wound rather than a switch to a different incision. The procedural flow before and after this segment aligns seamlessly with ongoing work on the right vertical slit, and the method—bite across, tie, trim, reposition—remains unchanged. This is noted as a documentation deficiency rather than a change in the operative target.

Returning to the clearly oriented view, the closure advances to the top of the right vertical incision. The operator continues to place precise, perpendicular bites at the superior end, with the forceps presenting each edge and the driver following the needle’s curvature through the material. A pass is made across the topmost segment; the suture is drawn through and the edges are approximated adjacent to the existing series below. In the following frames, tensioning and final knot formation secure this stitch, and scissors enter to trim the tails. A subsequent setup shows the needle reloaded and poised at an appropriate angle for what would be the next bite, indicating readiness to continue the same consistent technique further up or to complete any remaining gap.

By the end of the recording, the right-sided vertical incision is partially to largely closed from its inferior end upward with a series of neatly placed, evenly spaced interrupted stitches. The wound edges are well aligned with gentle eversion along the repaired segments, and the stitch line demonstrates consistent bite depth and setback across the length addressed. Knot stacks with short tails are visible primarily along the patient’s right side of the wound, reflecting uniform orientation and methodical tie placement. The lower and mid-portions are secure and trimmed; the superior portion has just received new passes, with one stitch tensioned and completed and positioning underway for the next. No suturing is performed on the central or left incisions at any time once instruments enter the field; earlier frames that showed the central slit without activity are superseded by the unambiguous, continuous work on the rightmost incision once the procedure begins.

Across the entire sequence, the technique remains consistent with well-executed interrupted suturing. The operator repeatedly demonstrates:
- Perpendicular needle entry and wrist-driven rotation to follow the needle’s arc.
- Balanced bites on each side with appropriate setback and depth to promote even approximation.
- Gentle eversion using Adson forceps, avoiding crushing or undue traction.
- Controlled draw-through of the suture with deliberate thread management that keeps the field clear.
- Instrument ties seated directly over the incision, cinched to “snug but not strangulating,” and tails trimmed short and uniform.

Hand positioning adapts as needed—at times the driver is in the right hand, at others in the left—yet the spatial logic is steady: instruments oppose across the wound, the driver stays centered on the bite axis, and the forceps present tissue and guide needle exit. Moments of regripping reflect attention to needle control and trajectory rather than changes in plan. Occasional brief pauses for tightening or trimming highlight a careful, stepwise rhythm in which each stitch is fully completed before the next begins.

In summary, what begins as a static overview transitions into a deliberate, organized closure of the short vertical incision along the right edge of the pad. The repair starts at the inferior end, secures an anchor stitch, and then advances proximally in a series of consistent, well-spaced interrupted stitches. Each stitch follows the same disciplined sequence—expose, pass, draw, tie, trim—resulting in progressive, cosmetically sound approximation with slight eversion. By the time the video ends, the right-side wound is neatly approximated through its lower and middle segments with additional work underway at the superior end, and the knot and tail profile along the patient’s right side confirms uniform, methodical completion of each step along the same continuous suture line. Where the footage is silent or momentarily misaligned, it limits real-time assessment but does not alter the clear procedural continuity: the closure proceeds exclusively on the right vertical incision using a consistent interrupted technique from bottom to top.
