COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a deliberate, methodical closure of a single linear laceration on a synthetic practice pad, returning to the same wound segment over time as the operator progresses from its inferior end up toward the superior end. Depending on pad orientation and camera view at different moments, the cut appears variably vertical, horizontal, or oblique, but the operative behavior remains consistent: the same line is addressed throughout, using simple interrupted sutures placed in sequence with careful attention to edge eversion, symmetric bites, and secure instrument ties. The technique is steady and largely consistent, with minor variations in hand use and tool choice as the surgeon alternates between driving the needle, tying, and trimming.

The work begins at the bottom of the line, at a short, full-thickness slit in the lower central field. The right hand, using a needle driver, approaches from the upper-right quadrant. The left hand enters with fine tissue forceps from the lower-left. The needle is loaded near its proximal third with the driver’s jaws and held perpendicular to the skin. At the very start, the left forceps steady and evert one edge and then the other, sliding to the right side where the first bite is taken. The tip of the needle contacts the right dermal margin at the inferior end, and the driver initiates a controlled rotation, driving the curved needle through in a natural arc. The two hands work in a compact triangle over the lower end of the cut, both staying close and parallel to the wound axis as the needle begins its passage. This first sequence establishes the surgeon’s rhythm: forceps present the dermis with minimal crush; the driver follows the arc; the entry and exit remain close to the wound edge to encourage precise approximation.

Immediately thereafter, the operator completes a full stitch and transitions to knot tying on the same line at a nearby segment that, in this view, appears transverse at the bottom of the field. The right hand still holds the needle driver superior-right to the wound, while the left hand—working from inferior-left—alternates between forceps for tissue control and the suture itself to handle the short tail. The needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip, driven through the near edge and out the far side in a smooth, rotational movement. Entry and exit points mirror one another, and the forceps maintain gentle eversion. Once the suture is through, the needle is parked safely out of the way and the driver becomes a tying instrument. The operator executes an instrument tie with multiple throws, cinching the knot centrally so the margins come together with mild puckering—typical of a snug simple interrupted closure. The hands cross briefly over the wound during the throws, then separate along the long axis of the cut to seat the knot.

Moving a little proximal along the same line, the surgeon places another stitch in a short vertical segment located in the lower central-left region. The right hand remains in charge of the needle driver; the left hand begins with tissue forceps to lift the near dermal margin and aid insertion. The needle is held at the proximal third and again oriented perpendicular to the surface. The pass is made across the wound, leaving a loop of suture. As the needle emerges, the driver regrips to pull it through. The left instrument then withdraws the forceps, later returning with scissors as the operator transitions to tying. The closure sequence is consistent: a bite is placed across both edges, then the suture is tensioned and readied for an instrument tie.

A subsequent segment shows the same wound as an oblique cut in the lower-left quadrant. Here, the tissue bite has already been taken; the operator focuses solely on tying over the existing stitch. The needle is not clamped—the driver is used purely to manipulate the suture strand. Throws are laid and cinched, with the left hand occasionally coming into view to steady the free end. The driver alternates positions just superior and to the right of the line, crossing it during throws and then pulling squared knots down centrally. No forceps are applied to tissue in these frames, and no additional needle passes occur. The edges are already approximated and compress further as the knot is tightened.

With that knot secured, the tails are trimmed. The driver stands vertically over the knot to lift and present the suture. Scissors enter from the left and pass beneath the driver tips to snip the tails close to the knot. This tidy sequence—parking the needle, tying with the driver, and cutting with scissors introduced from the left—repeats in later portions of the procedure whenever a stitch is finalized. The operator’s economy of movement is notable: the instruments remain directly above the wound, and only the minimum suture manipulation needed to achieve a neat knot and clean cut is performed.

Returning again to the same lower-central line, the surgeon advances superiorly to place a new pass above a previously tied stitch whose lower “X” is visible. The right hand positions the needle driver over the right margin, the left hand uses forceps on the left margin to provide counter-traction and eversion, and the needle is aligned perpendicular to the surface. Carefully, the needle tip is set just lateral to the right edge, and the pass is initiated toward the left. This sequence closely mirrors the initial approach: the left forceps present the dermis with a light, atraumatic grip; the driver uses a smooth, arcing motion; and the bite depth and distance from the edge appear consistent with the prior suture. As the needle exits the left side, the suture is drawn through fully, leaving sufficient tail for an upcoming knot. In these frames there is no tying—only placement and pull-through—demonstrating a stepwise, repetitive technique applied up the length of the same wound.

In a set of tying sequences centered over an oblique-appearing segment, the surgeon secures the recently placed stitch with instrument ties. The right hand (superior/central) repeatedly grasps and releases the standing end to form loops, while the left hand at the lower-left holds the short end steady and provides counter-tension. The suture traverses across the laceration, and successive throws draw the knot downward until it seats centrally with the edges neatly opposing. Again, minimal additional tissue handling is performed; there is no need to re-grasp the margins because the prior bite has already achieved alignment and eversion.

Completion of these stitches includes deliberate trimming. The right-hand driver stabilizes the knot just superior to the line, maintaining light upward tension to expose the tails. The left hand brings scissors in from the left to cut the ends close to, but not flush with, the knot. Each cut is performed with the instruments centered over the wound, ensuring that trimming neither disturbs edge approximation nor leaves tails excessively long.

The operator then continues superiorly along the same slit, with the wound now viewed as a short vertical segment near the lower center. A previously tied knot lies inferior to the new bite site. The right hand brings the needle driver from the upper-right toward the incision; the left hand uses Adson-type forceps from the lower-left to control and evert the right wound lip near the bite site, a common maneuver when the dominant hand is planned to enter that side first. The needle, held about two-thirds from its tip, is oriented perpendicular to the skin with an intended pass from right to left. After the bite is driven and retrieved, the forceps switch tasks smoothly—first stabilizing tissue, then briefly seizing the needle tip to guide it out, before releasing for the driver to regrip. Symmetry is emphasized: small, matched bites near the margin are chosen to preserve alignment and encourage uniform eversion.

Once that pass is complete, the surgeon ties it. The left hand controls the tail, and the right hand—still using the driver—executes an instrument tie with smooth, alternating throws. The suture is seated down squarely over the incision. In some passes, the needle remains attached to the long end and is parked lateral to the field while tying; this keeps the work efficient, though it demands controlled movements to avoid accidental pricks or unintended tissue contact. The wound edges hold well, with eversion maintained by the suture tension and the gentle counter-traction from the two hands as each throw is snugged.

A brief tightening and trimming sequence follows on the same short vertical wound: the right hand centers scissors or a driver over the topmost knot; the left hand occasionally reappears with forceps to hold a tail out of the way; and the cut is made directly above the knot. Instruments withdraw together without disturbing adjacent segments. At this stage, the inferior part of the line is visibly occupied by multiple neatly spaced stitches with the newly secured knot at the superior-most position of that cluster.

From here, attention shifts to a longer, central portion of the same linear wound as the operator continues upward. The view now presents this laceration as the midline vertical incision at the center of the pad. Several interrupted sutures have already been completed in the lower half; the next stitch is planned just superior to those. The right hand holds the needle driver, and the left hand brings in tissue forceps as needed. The technique remains consistent: the needle is held on its body (proximal third to midpoint), perpendicular to the skin, and driven cleanly through the right margin with the driver regripping to retrieve it on the left. The left forceps stabilize and evert the edges during the pass. No tying is shown in that specific passage, but the stitch forms the setup to be secured in the next moment.

The next sequences show exactly that—tying the newly placed bite along this central vertical segment. The left hand assists by everting or gently controlling the superior wound edge while the driver is repurposed to form instrument ties. In some ties, the needle remains clamped in the jaws while the driver manipulates the strand; in others, the needle is parked and the jaws grasp only suture. Throws are laid meticulously, and each is seated with a straight pull along the wound axis to avoid twisting the approximated edges. With the knot secure, scissors enter from the left to trim tails, and the driver maintains mild tension to present the suture to the scissors efficiently.

Working steadily up the same line, the surgeon repeats this sequence of setting a bite, tying, and trimming. One passage shows the driver holding the long end of the suture while the left hand manages the short end near the knot, alternating across the midline during throws. Another segment shows the operator tying and then immediately trimming within the same set of frames, completing a stitch cleanly before moving further up. Each of these cycles is performed within a few millimeters of the wound margins, with the instruments oriented parallel to the incision’s length and the spacing in line with the earlier stitches.

As the surgeon approaches the superior portion of the line, the preparatory movements become more explicit. With the left hand holding Adson forceps at the left wound edge near the top of the incision and the right hand’s driver poised over the right margin, the needle is loaded about two-thirds from the tip. It is lined up to enter the right edge for a right-to-left pass across the gap. The forceps lift and evert the left margin in anticipation of the exit point, ensuring alignment and edge presentation. This setup is repeated for successive superior bites, reinforcing the operator’s pattern of opposing tool positions across the wound and symmetric entry and exit.

At the uppermost segment, the individual passes are performed with special care. In one, the needle is reloaded above the wound and the driver advances perpendicularly while the left forceps briefly grasp the needle tip to guide it through, after which the driver regrips to pull the needle out fully. The suture loop forms as the needle exits, arcing superiorly; the strand is drawn through so that a short tail remains on the left. The left hand, when not controlling tissue, manages the strands, ensuring the tail is available for tying while the long end remains untangled and ready to be looped with the driver.

In the final series of placements, the surgeon continues with the same pattern at the very top of the wound. With several prior stitches already approximating the mid-portion, the right hand holds the driver above and slightly to the patient’s right of the line; the left hand’s forceps enter to the left of the wound to stabilize and evert the edge. The needle is driven from left to right in one pass and in another from right to left, demonstrating facility with either direction depending on which side is best presented. In each case, the needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip and oriented perpendicular to the skin so that the arc follows the curve of the needle. After exiting, the driver regrips on the far side to draw the needle through, and the suture is pulled until the tail length is appropriate for tying.

With the final pass completed, the operator transitions to tying at the top of the line. The right-hand instrument engages the free end while the left hand manages either the standing end or the tail, adjusting as needed to maintain controlled tension. The throws are formed cleanly with the driver, and the knot is seated directly over the wound. No direct tissue manipulation is needed at this stage, as the earlier bites and the final pass already align and approximate the edges. The last act is trimming: the right-hand instrument holds light tension on the suture adjacent to the top knot, and the left hand brings in scissors from the upper-left. The scissors cross briefly under the driver tips to cut the tails close to the knot. The instruments withdraw, leaving a neatly seated knot and well-approximated edges.

Throughout, hand positions and their evolution are predictable and efficient. The right hand almost always holds the needle driver and approaches from superior-right or directly over the wound, both for driving and for tying. The left hand alternates roles—first as the tissue handler with forceps to stabilize and evert each margin during needle passage, then as the assistant to manage the short suture end during tying, and finally as the cutting hand with scissors to trim tails. The two hands repeatedly straddle the wound, creating a working triangle with the cut at the center, and alternate crossing over the midline during throws. The driver’s jaws maintain an orthogonal orientation to the skin during needle entry and follow the curvature of the needle through the tissue; during tying, the same instrument becomes a suture grasper, with throws formed over or adjacent to the wound and then cinched centrally. Scissor entries are consistent—nearly always from the left—with the right instrument presenting the suture for safe, controlled trimming.

The technique itself remains that of simple interrupted closure from start to finish. Each stitch is placed with matched entry and exit points, a small bite depth near the wound margin, and gentle eversion facilitated by the left-hand forceps. Knots are formed with instrument ties; throws are alternated and squared down. Minor procedural idiosyncrasies appear intermittently: in some tying sequences the needle remains in the driver’s jaws while the suture is manipulated, which, while efficient, can be less ideal from a safety standpoint. Occasionally, no forceps are used during tying and the edges are not further everted at that moment, relying instead on the geometry of the bites already taken. And at times, tightening leads to slight puckering or mild inversion at a knot, which is common on synthetic pads and is typically mitigated by spacing and tension control on subsequent sutures. Despite these small variations, the operator’s approach is consistent—adhering to perpendicular needle entry, curved follow-through, symmetric bites, and careful knot security.

By the end of the sequence, the single linear wound—initially addressed at its inferior end and progressively closed upward—is neatly approximated with multiple simple interrupted sutures. Inferiorly, the earliest stitches are tied and trimmed, with tidy, short tails. The mid-portion shows a continuous line of evenly spaced knots with preserved eversion and alignment. At the superior end, the last stitch is placed, tied, and its tails cut, completing the closure. The final state is a continuous series of secure knots along the same line, the edges uniformly approximated with slight, expected puckering around certain knots, and no residual gaps. The work is confined to this one wound throughout, and across all segments the instrument choreography—driver on the right or over the wound, forceps on the left for eversion, and scissors from the left for trimming—remains stable, culminating in a clean, well-executed simple interrupted repair from the bottom of the laceration to its top.
