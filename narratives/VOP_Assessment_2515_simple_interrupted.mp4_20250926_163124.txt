COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses on the single vertical incision located on the right side of the practice pad. From the earliest frames through to the end of the sequence the operator returns repeatedly to and works along the same right‑sided linear wound, progressively placing, tightening, and securing a row of interrupted skin sutures from a more distal portion toward the superior end. The sequence shows a consistent approach: bimanual control with a needle driver and toothed tissue forceps to evert and approximate edges, passage of a curved needle in controlled arcs with mid‑shaft or near‑swage grips, followed by knot formation, tail management and trimming. Some frames capture needle passes and knot‑tying; other intervals show manipulation of already‑placed sutures or a single hand controlling suture tails, but these episodes all relate to successive interrupted closures along the same incision.

Initial approach and setup
At the outset the operator identifies the vertical incision on the right pad and positions gloved hands over the wound. Early frames show both hands approaching from above and slightly laterally, with the dominant hand taking a needle driver and the non‑dominant preparing to use fine toothed forceps. The field is a synthetic dermal pad; there is no bleeding, and work is limited to approximating the skin edges. The operator consistently chooses small, skin‑margin bites — generally close to the epidermal edge — intended to approximate the dermis with minimal bulk. Throughout the recording the operator uses a curved needle and monofilament suture material. Instrument tips habitually converge over the wound within a narrow working distance (typically 1–3 cm), favoring precise bite placement and control.

Passage technique and tissue handling
Needle grips vary slightly frame to frame but remain within standard practice: the needle driver grasps the curved needle at about mid‑shaft to one‑third to one‑half of the length from the hub in many passes, and occasionally closer to the swage for greater control when tying. The needle is driven in a controlled arc through the synthetic dermis; the driver’s wrist rotation and short, deliberate motions permit perpendicular or slightly oblique entry and exit relative to the wound edge. The opposing forceps lift, evert and stabilize the near edge prior to each pass, producing the slight eversion visible at each completed stitch. Bites are consistently superficial to mid‑dermal on the simulator rather than deep transfixion, producing a neat approximation of the skin without excessive puckering.

Hand dynamics and spatial relationships as suturing progresses
Across the timeline the relationship of the two hands is remarkably consistent: the instrument that holds the needle and performs the active passage alternates between the operator’s left and right hands in different segments, but in any given pass the pair works in close coordination. Typically one hand (needle driver) approaches from a superior/medial or lateral direction to place the needle, while the other (toothed forceps) opposes from slightly inferior or lateral positions to elevate and evert the margin. Instrument tips often cross minimally above the incision to facilitate a perpendicular bite; at times they are held nearly parallel. Hands remain within a very small workspace directly over the incision for precise control.

Progression of stitch placement along the incision
Work on the incision proceeds in a sequential fashion from an area of preexisting closure toward the superior end. Early and mid segments show placement of individual interrupted stitches adjacent to preexisting sutures, while later intervals show knot tying, tightening, and trimming of recently placed stitches as the operator advances superiorly. The operator routinely orients the needle tip toward the intended exit point and withdraws the instrument in a controlled fashion, pulling suture material through the tissue and managing the free limb with the non‑dominant hand or forceps. In many sequences a new bite is taken directly next to the prior stitch, maintaining consistent spacing with slight eversion to promote edge apposition.

Technique during active needle passes
When actively passing the needle the operator consistently uses bimanual technique: forceps lift and evert the near edge, then the needle driver advances the curved needle through the opposite margin with a short arc. The grip on the needle is firm and placed to maximize control of the curvature; the curvature is used to facilitate the arc through the pad without wide sweeping hand motion. Needle entry tends to be close to the wound edge — a small margin — and the exit mirrors that margin on the opposing side to achieve symmetric bites. During these passes the suture is drawn through until a loop is formed; the free tail is then managed and prepared for knotting.

Knot formation, tightening, and tail management
Following needle passage, the operator typically transitions into knot‑tying and suture management steps in the same short working area. Several intervals depict the needle driver being used to rotate the needle or to hold the suture while the opposite hand tensions the free limb with fingers or forceps. Knot formation is performed through coordinated movements of both hands: the driver positions the suture loop while the other hand provides counter‑tension and manipulates tails. Once the surgeon seats and secures the knot, scissors or a hemostat are introduced in some frames to trim the tails; these instruments appear briefly and are removed once cutting is complete. In other frames the driver and forceps adjust and tighten knots without additional instruments. Throughout, the operator ensures the knot seats properly so that the wound margins remain approximated with the slight eversion desired for skin closure.

Variations and intermittent single‑handed activity
Not every segment shows an active needle pass; multiple frames depict phases where needle or knot activity is not visible. During those episodes the operator either manipulates already‑placed sutures (tensioning, positioning, trimming tails), or only one gloved hand is in frame working on suture tails while the other temporarily withdraws. There are also intervals where instruments rest at the periphery of the field and the stitch line appears static. These episodes reflect natural transitions between passes and the process of finishing individual interrupted sutures. A small number of frames show needle or needle holder not visible at all; where that occurs, sutures remain intact and edges approximated, consistent with intervals devoted to knot securing and trimming rather than fresh needle passage.

Consistency of stitch placement and tissue apposition
Across the entire course the operator maintains consistent bite depth and spacing. Each stitch is positioned to approximate the dermal edges with mild eversion; no deep layer work or undermining is attempted on the model. The forceps are used repeatedly to lift and evert the margin before each pass, producing a uniform outward roll at suture sites. Tension is applied prudently during tightening, enough to seat knots and close the gap yet avoid overtightening that would excessively invert or strangulate the synthetic dermis. The continuity of technique — needle grip, trajectory, opposing forceps elevation, and knot technique — is maintained from early placements through the final stitches.

Directional sequence and overall pattern
The operator progresses serially along the same vertical incision in a cephalad direction. The earliest described passes and earlier‑timestamp frames concentrate on bites near the inferior and mid portions of the wound where prior sutures already exist; subsequent frames show placement and completion of additional interrupted sutures moving toward the superior end. Later timestamps capture the final passes, the finishing of last knots, snipping of tails and a brief inspection of the completed line. Even when a single hand is visible or instruments are not clearly seen, subsequent frames demonstrate the work linked to the same line and the same pattern of interrupted closures.

Noted observational limitations
A subset of image clusters lacks clear visual of the needle or shows only one gloved hand: some brief intervals capture only suture tail manipulation, or the hand moving over the wound without instruments clearly visible. Also, one very early short clip describes activity at a middle incision which differs from the predominant right‑side focus; given the overwhelming continuity of the right‑sided vertical wound throughout the remainder of the frames, the narrative follows and consolidates the visible actions around that right‑sided linear incision. These intermittent limitations do not materially disrupt the assessment of the progressive interrupted closure of the right‑sided incision, but they do mean a few micro‑details (exact needle grip at a given frame, minute hand rotations at the instant a needle is out of view) cannot be documented in every single frame.

Final inspection and wound appearance
By the closing frames the entire vertical incision on the right pad is bridged by a sequential row of interrupted skin sutures, knots seated and tails trimmed in the newer stitches, and previously placed stitches intact along the length of the wound. Tissue edges are held in close apposition with mild eversion at each bite. The overall line is neat and uniform: small, evenly spaced superficial-to-middermal bites, consistent knot technique, and controlled suture tail management. Hands and instruments withdraw from the immediate field in the final images, leaving a completed interrupted closure that approximates the incision edges with appropriate eversion and without overt tension or distortion.

Summary of procedural flow
Throughout the case the operator maintained a predictable, reproducible method: identify the incision, approximate the edges with forceps to evert the dermis, use a needle driver to grasp a curved needle in a mid‑shaft to near‑swage position, pass the needle in a controlled arc through opposing edges, draw the suture through, and secure the stitch with standard knotting technique before trimming tails. This cycle repeats in sequence from a previously sutured region toward the superior end of the right‑sided incision, producing a continuous, orderly row of interrupted skin sutures and a final closed wound with consistent apposition and slight eversion across its length.
