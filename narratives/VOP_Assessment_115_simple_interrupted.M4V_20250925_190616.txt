COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The operator consistently concentrates work on the right-most vertical incision of the practice skin pad — the lateral-most of the three parallel linear wounds. From the beginning of the recording the same short, full-thickness linear defect is addressed repeatedly, with an evolving series of interrupted skin sutures placed along its length. The technique is classic interrupted closure of a superficial skin wound on a synthetic dermal model: a curved, swaged needle is controlled with a needle driver in the dominant hand while the opposite hand uses fine tissue forceps, fingertips, or a gloved finger to stabilize and evert the near edge and to manage the suture tail. Throughout the procedure the wound edges are approximated to the epidermal/dermal plane only — no deep-layer work is performed — and stitches are placed sequentially to close the length of the lateral incision.

Initial approach and first passes (0–60 s)
At the outset the operator positions both hands immediately adjacent to the lateral wound, typically with the needle driver approaching from the superior/cranial quadrant and the tissue-holding hand coming in from the lateral/inferior side. A curved needle, grasped in the jaws of the driver roughly at the mid‑to‑proximal shaft, is oriented with its tip aimed toward the tissue so that the natural arc can be drawn through the synthetic dermis. Early passes show the driver rotating the needle through the near limb and then the far limb of the incision in a smooth sweeping arc. In several frames the assistant hand steadies the lateral margin with forceps and slightly everts the edge so that the bite seats superficially through the epidermal/dermal layer; bites appear shallow-to-mid dermal on the simulator.

Hands remain close throughout these initial cycles, often within 2–5 cm of one another. The dominant hand’s instrument repeatedly swings down from the upper-right, while the nondominant hand holds or tensions the suture line below and lateral to the entry site. The operator takes small, controlled bites so that previously placed interrupted sutures near the midline are roughly evenly spaced; each pass is followed by pulling the suture through and preparing to tie.

Serial interrupted placement and role repetition (60–150 s)
As the sequence progresses, the operator establishes a rhythm. Needle passes and suture management alternate rapidly: the driver secures the curved needle near the body, drives it across one edge and through the opposing edge, then releases so the other hand can take tension on the free tail and prepare for knot tying. Tissue forceps are used intermittently to evert and steady the near edge; at times fingers are used to maintain suture tension instead of formal forceps. Instrument positions are consistent: the driver generally remains superior or lateral to the wound while the forceps/hand stabilize the opposite margin inferiorly. Where present, a hemostat or needle-holder rests to the side and is occasionally brought in for knot control.

Throughout this middle period the operator proceeds to place additional interrupted stitches along the length of the lateral incision. Multiple frames show fresh suture material running along the incision and newly seated bites with visible tails. Needle grip is consistently at or just behind the needle midpoint — a deliberate choice that allows secure control of curvature and precise arc placement. Needle orientation varies slightly between perpendicular-to-oblique vs. more perpendicular passes, but the motion is consistently a controlled arc through the synthetic skin. Edges are approximated closely, often with slight eversion to ensure epidermal apposition.

Occasional pauses for knot-tying, suture management, and instrument exchange are evident. In several segments the needle is not visible — the operator is securing knots, trimming tails, or repositioning instruments — but the focus remains on completing each interrupted cycle before moving to the next location along the same lateral incision. The operator alternates working proximally and distally along the incision during different episodes; the majority of passes, however, cluster toward the superior portion at particular times and toward the inferior portion at others, reflecting a sequential filling-in of the wound length.

Mid-procedure detail and variation (150–210 s)
Throughout the mid portions of the film the same technical hallmarks persist: the curved needle gripped mid‑to‑proximal in the driver; the tip directed toward the tissue; the nondominant hand using forceps or fingers to stabilize and maintain tension. The operator occasionally approaches the wound from slightly different angles (from above/cranial or from the top/left), but hand proximity remains tight — instrument tips typically cross within a few centimeters of each other at the bite point. Bites remain superficial, demonstrating a focus on epidermal/dermal apposition.

Some frames document the operator actively completing knot cycles: tensioning suture tails, bringing the knot down to seat the edges with mild eversion, and preparing scissors or hemostats to trim tails. There are also brief episodes where activity appears limited to suture handling and adjustment rather than fresh needle penetration — the needle driver is positioned over the superior portion of the wound while the other hand manages suture tails below. These moments show the standard workflow of interrupted closure: pass the needle, pull a controlled amount of suture through, tie secure throws, trim, and then regrip the needle for the next pass.

A minor inconsistency is present in a short middle segment where notes describe the central (middle) incision being manipulated; however, every other frame and the overall sequence indicate continuous work on the lateral-most incision. Given the continuity of the suture material and repeated instrumentation localized to the right-most wound across most timestamps, the intent and activity remain focused on the lateral incision line for the duration.

Continued sequential passes and tightening (210–270 s)
As the procedure continues into the later third of the recording, the operator methodically continues to add interrupted stitches along the lateral incision. Several frames explicitly depict new passes at the superior aspect while others show additions toward the inferior end; overall the operator fills the length of the wound with serial, evenly spaced interrupted sutures. Each cycle shows a deliberate technique: tissue grasped and slightly everted with forceps, needle driven with a mid-shaft grip and rotated through the tissue, suture pulled through and tensioned, and then knot-tying motions executed with the hands in close cooperation.

Needle-handling remains remarkably consistent: the driver grasps the curved suture needle near the shaft, bringing the tip down perpendicular or slightly oblique to the wound margin, and advances it in a curved sweep. The operator uses short, controlled instrument motions to minimize extraneous tissue drag on the synthetic pad and to ensure uniform bite depth. Spatially, the driver normally approaches from above or superior-right while the forceps approach from below or lateral-right; this relationship allows precise opposing movements at the bite site, facilitating controlled rotation of the needle and reliable seat of each knot.

Suture management and finish maneuvers (270–330 s)
Approaching the end of the recorded sequence the pattern shifts gradually from placing fresh passes to securing and managing the newly placed sutures. Several frames show the needle driver positioned over the superior portion of the incision but not actively penetrating tissue — instead the operator is adjusting suture tension, regrasping the needle in preparation for the next minute pass, or trimming/arranging tails. One short frame block contains little evidence of a fresh tissue penetration and looks to be focused on needle repositioning or suture management rather than a new bite.

Throughout these finishing maneuvers the hand relationship remains tightly coordinated: the driver remains superior-medial to the wound while the suture‑managing hand supports the tail and brings the edges together with fingertip control or forceps. Completed interrupted sutures are visible along the length and the operator repeatedly inspects and adjusts tension to maintain uniform apposition. The consistent slight eversion seen earlier is carried into these final adjustments, suggesting conscious attention to epidermal-edge alignment to optimize healing alignment.

Final observations and wound appearance (330–end)
By the final frames the lateral incision is bridged by a continuous series of interrupted stitches that are evenly spaced and secured. Earlier frames that showed fresh needle passes and active pulls have progressed to images of needles being retrieved or removed, knots being seated, and suture tails arranged for trimming. Instruments are withdrawn in some frames, and in others the left hand momentarily obscures the pad while arranging final suture material; the overall impression is of a completed interrupted closure.

Across the entire sequence the suturing technique remains consistent and deliberate: mid‑shaft needle grips, small controlled arcs through the superficial skin surrogate, forceps-assisted edge eversion/approximation, sequential interrupted placement from one end of the lateral incision to the other, and methodical knot tying and suture management. Hands and instruments remain in close proximity over the wound throughout — typically within 1–5 cm — enabling the precise opposing motions required for rapid, reliable interrupted suturing.

Quality and technique notes
- Bites are consistently superficial to mid-dermal on the synthetic model, with no evidence of deep-subcutaneous passes; the closure relies entirely on epidermal/dermal apposition.
- Slight eversion of the edges is employed to promote epidermal edge-to-edge contact once knots are tied down; this is maintained throughout the sequence.
- Needle grip is generally at the mid-to-proximal curve of the needle, permitting controlled rotation through the tissue arc and convenient regrasping for subsequent passes.
- Instrument exchange and knot-tying follow a predictable pattern, and suture tails are managed between passes to avoid entanglement.
- A brief discrepancy appears in one mid-sequence annotation suggesting a different incision was being worked; however, the majority of visual cues — instrument localization, suture material along the lateral line, and repeated manipulations at the same lateral site — support uninterrupted closure of the lateral-most incision for the entire recording.

Final state
At the end of the procedure the right-most vertical incision is closed with a serial line of interrupted sutures, each tied down to approximate the epidermal edges with slight eversion and minimal gapping. Suture material and trimmed tails are visible along the incision; instruments are in the process of being withdrawn or repositioned after the final knot has been secured. The chosen technique remained uniform from initial needle pass through final knot seating, producing a neatly approximated skin closure appropriate for the simulated dermal model.
