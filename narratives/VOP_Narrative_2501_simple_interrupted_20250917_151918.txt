COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on a single wound: the rightmost of three parallel incisions on the synthetic skin pad. From the first frames to the last, all definitive suture placement, knotting, and trimming are concentrated on this right-edge vertical slit. The surgeon works methodically from the lower/mid portion upward, building a line of simple interrupted stitches. Although the camera/viewer perspective briefly shifts and some descriptions momentarily reference another slit or an oblique line, no completed stitch is ever placed on any incision other than the rightmost vertical slit. Those brief deviations function more like needle loading and reorientation interludes; the active work always returns to the same right-side wound, and the evolving suture line can be tracked continuously there.

The opening sequence sets the tone for careful, perpendicular needle handling and steady tissue management. The field shows the rightmost slit with no stitches yet completed. The left hand holds the needle driver; the right hand uses forceps on the near/right wound edge to evert and present tissue. The needle is grasped about one-third from the swaged end, oriented orthogonal to the skin, and advanced across the gap. In these earliest moments, the movement is all about establishing the first bite along the mid-to-lower third of the slit: the right wound margin is lifted and the needle is passed from right to left in a controlled arc, with the driver regripping near the tip to guide the needle through as the right-hand forceps assist at the exit. No knotting occurs in this first pass; it’s pure placement and pull-through with the thread managed to avoid snagging the pad or edges.

Immediately thereafter the operator prepares to secure that initial pass. There is a brief interlude where the hands and needle are seen aligning over an incision described as the center slit. Functionally, this portion serves as needle loading and approach practice; there is no completed stitch on the center line at any time in the overall sequence. The operator quickly returns to the same rightmost slit and resumes the suturing sequence there. The needle driver is now in the right hand, working just lateral to the slit, with the left hand handling the free strand and stabilizing the skin edges using fingers rather than pickups. The needle is again oriented perpendicularly; a bite is advanced, and the thread is pulled through. The movement is fluid and stays close to the wound to maintain control.

With the first pass established, the operator proceeds to knot the first stitch at the lower third of the rightmost incision. The instrument tie sequence is classic: the right hand (needle driver) captures the free end managed by the left hand; wraps are formed and seated; throws are squared down over the center of the slit. Knot security is emphasized by keeping the wraps flat and alternating direction. Scissors are brought in briefly to trim the tails once the knot is set. By this point, one simple interrupted stitch is clearly present across the rightmost slit, approximating the edges near the lower third. In the following frames, that single completed stitch remains visible and is the anchor around which subsequent bites are planned superiorly.

The surgeon then begins to build proximally along the same line. The left hand alternates between forceps and fingers for countertraction; the right hand holds the needle driver consistently. The needle is held at the proximal third to mid-body—largely two-thirds from the tip—and is driven orthogonally to the skin for symmetric bites. The right wound edge is sometimes lifted with forceps to promote edge eversion, though in several sequences the operator opts for gentle finger stabilization without pickups. With the first stitch still visible at mid-to-lower levels, the next pass is taken superior to it. Instrument-tying technique is maintained with the driver used both as a knot pusher and as the tying tool. A knot is constructed and seated in a controlled manner at the upper portion of the area now being closed. As the throws are advanced, the driver crosses the incision line and then re-centers to square the knot, minimizing torsion on adjacent stitches. Once tied, the second stitch joins the first, and two completed simple interrupted sutures are now visible on this rightmost slit.

Working further up the same wound, the operator keeps the needle perpendicular and the bites symmetric, building a clean ladder of stitches. There is a consistent theme of right-hand dominance for the needle driver, though early and intermittent moments show the driver in the left hand; the operator is comfortable switching hands to improve angle and wrist motion. Across these phases, the left hand assists in multiple roles—lifting edges with pickups when needed, maintaining gentle tension on the free limb, and bracing the pad to resist torque during tying. The second stitch is occasionally re-tensioned as the next pass is prepared, but the two existing knots remain intact and visible, their short tails trimmed cleanly to reduce clutter.

The third stitch is initiated superior to the first two. The right hand holds the driver just above the existing knot cluster, while the left hand—often with forceps—presents the right wound edge. The needle tip is precisely positioned to enter the right margin and exit the opposite side with a shallow, symmetric dermal bite. The suture is pulled through, and the operator transitions to tying. In one interposed segment, the camera briefly captures activity described as an oblique incision with knot cinching; in context of the broader sequence, this represents a temporary perspective shift rather than a change in the active wound. The same tying mechanics occur: the driver advances throws and seats them neatly on the surface. Following this intermission, the field returns clearly to the rightmost vertical slit and shows two completed stitches still visible while the next pass is prepared. Shortly afterward, the third stitch is decisively placed and tied on the rightmost slit. The hands alternate driver and pickup use to square the knot, then scissors cut the tails. At this point, three completed stitches span the central part of the wound, approximating the edges with slight eversion where forceps assisted and flat opposition where finger stabilization was used.

Suture management becomes even more deliberate as the line ascends. The operator organizes the free strand away from the next bite site, avoiding entanglement with earlier knots. At times the driver is parked on the suture near the needle to maintain control while switching hand tasks. The fourth stitch is planned at the superior end of the rightmost slit; three completed stitches are visible just inferior to the target. The forceps briefly lift the superior wound edge to improve visualization and entry angle, then the needle is advanced across in a smooth wrist-driven arc. The suture is drawn through with controlled tension to avoid strangulating the tissue. An instrument tie sequence follows, with the driver and the non-dominant hand trading roles to maintain opposite tension on the two limbs while successive throws are created. In one sequence, the stitch is explicitly shown in the process of being tied; in a subsequent sequence, the same stitch is tightened and the tails are trimmed. Together these moments capture the full completion of the fourth stitch.

From this point forward, the line shows four completed simple interrupted stitches along the rightmost incision. The spacing is consistent, and the edges are approximated throughout the mid-to-lower and mid portions; the superior-most segment remains slightly open, poised for a potential next stitch. The operator continues to work at the superior end, loading the needle and aligning perpendicular entry, suggesting intent to place a fifth stitch. The right hand holds the needle driver lateral/superior to the incision; the left hand manages the free strand and maintains a clear path for the needle. The pad is occasionally rotated slightly to improve ergonomics and maintain perpendicularity to the wound edge. However, during these uppermost attempts, no additional stitch is fully realized: no new knot is seen tied to completion on the wound after the fourth. Some sequences depict tensioning of a new pass or initial throws being advanced, but subsequent frames consistently show the field returning to four completed stitches. The scissors are used to finalize trimming on the previously tied stitch, leaving a neat row of knots with short tails oriented laterally off the right side of the incision line.

Hand positions evolve predictably with the task. Early on, the left hand often carries the driver while the right hand uses forceps to evert the right wound edge; this allows a forehand pass from right to left across the gap. As the work progresses and the operator moves superiorly, the right hand more consistently holds the driver, with the left hand alternating between pickups, direct fingertip stabilization, and suture management. During knot tying, the driver frequently crosses the incision to capture the short end, then pulls away to tighten before sliding the knot down squarely over the slit. When instrument ties are used without forceps on tissue, the left hand tends to handle the free limb, providing counter-tension and indexing the knot down the line. Scissor use is conservative and precise—brought in only after knots are clearly secured and then withdrawn promptly to keep the field uncluttered.

Technique remains consistent throughout: simple interrupted sutures placed sequentially along the same rightmost slit, with instrument ties to secure each knot. Needle orientation is kept nearly perpendicular to the skin surface, and bites are symmetric across the wound edges. Where forceps are employed, they are used gently to evert the margin without crushing; where fingers are used, they provide adequate counterpressure to guide the needle and prevent tissue drag. Knot seating is methodical, with the driver used as a knot pusher to snug each throw down. Spatially, the driver tends to operate just superior-right (or superior-left during hand switches) to the target bite site, while the assisting hand hovers inferior-medial, managing either the tissue edge or the suture limb.

There are a few brief deficiencies or nonstandard elements worth noting that do not change the fundamental continuity of the case. On several occasions, forceps are not used for eversion, and the wound edges are approximated primarily by suture tension, producing less pronounced eversion than textbook ideal. In addition, the camera or operator briefly aligns over a neighboring slit or an oblique-looking segment while loading or tying; these moments do not culminate in any completed sutures away from the rightmost incision and appear to be perspective shifts or off-line handling rather than true diversion. One segment also shows a temporary idle field with hands briefly offscreen; here the previously placed stitches on the rightmost slit are clearly visible and unchanged. Across all of these, the central narrative remains uninterrupted: the same rightmost incision is the only wound that receives completed stitches throughout.

As the procedure nears its conclusion, the rightmost slit displays a tidy series of four completed simple interrupted stitches from mid-to-lower up toward the superior half. The operator examines the superior end, appears to prepare a next bite, and tensions the suture, but ultimately no fifth stitch is tied to completion in the observed sequence. The final frames are quiet: the pad sits with the rightmost incision approximated at four points, suture tails trimmed, and no additional instruments in view. The two central slits remain untouched and gaping throughout the case.

Suture progression and count, step by step:
- Initial passes and preparation: 0 completed stitches. The first bite is taken across the rightmost slit, and the strand is drawn through; no knot yet.
- First stitch completed and tied: The lower third receives a simple interrupted stitch that is tied and trimmed. Completed count: 1.
- Second stitch placed and tied superior to the first: With consistent perpendicular entry and instrument ties, the count increases to 2.
- Third stitch planned and then completed proximal to the second: After preparatory passes and tying sequences, the third stitch is definitively tied and trimmed. Count: 3.
- Fourth stitch placed at the superior portion of the same slit: The stitch is tied, squared, and trimmed. Count rises to 4.
- Attempts/preparation for a possible fifth stitch are seen but are not carried to completion within the observed frames: The count remains 4.

Final state:
- The procedure resulted in 4 completed sutures on the rightmost vertical incision.
- These four simple interrupted stitches are evenly spaced along the mid-to-lower two-thirds extending toward the superior half, with knots and short tails visible primarily on the right side of the wound.
- The superior-most segment shows readiness for another stitch, but no additional completed knot is present in the final frames.
- The other two central slits receive no stitches and remain unchanged.

In summary, the surgeon performs a straightforward series of simple interrupted sutures along the rightmost incision, progressing from inferior/mid to superior with careful, perpendicular needle handling and instrument ties. Hand dominance shifts as needed to optimize needle trajectory and knot seating, while tissue control alternates between gentle forceps eversion and fingertip stabilization. Despite brief camera or perspective shifts and occasional idle frames, the continuity of the case is clear: a single suture line is built on the rightmost slit, culminating in four firmly tied and trimmed stitches visible at the end. This exact final count—four completed sutures—is confirmed in the last static views, where no new stitch is added beyond the established series.
