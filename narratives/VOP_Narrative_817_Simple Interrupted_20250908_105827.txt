COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a suture training pad with multiple linear incisions. Work begins at the lower‑central slit. The right hand introduces fine forceps to gently evert and steady the left wound edge while the left hand brings in a needle driver carrying a curved needle held at the proximal-to-middle third. The needle is aligned perpendicular to the skin and precisely aimed for the first bite; the suture trails free and controlled.

The first pass follows immediately. With the driver still in the left hand, the needle arcs through the near (left) edge. The right-hand forceps assist both by everting the far (right) edge and by briefly controlling the needle tip during the handoff. The driver regrips on the far side to complete the passage, and the suture is drawn across, leaving a balanced configuration: a long strand to the upper right and a shorter tail to the left at the entry site.

Without pausing, the operator transitions into instrument ties. The needle is kept parked off to the side on the long strand to avoid the knot. The left-hand needle driver becomes the post above the wound, while the right hand manipulates the free end with fingers. The long limb wraps over the driver; the driver captures the short tail and draws it through, sliding the first throw down to approximate the edges. Subsequent throws are alternated in direction to square the knot, with the driver and right hand trading sides to maintain even, opposing tension. The knot settles directly over the incision without blanching, the wound edges coapted by suture tension rather than forceps.

Briefly, the right hand pulls residual slack through the previously placed bite, organizing the suture arc and clearing the field. No new penetration occurs during this interlude; it’s a tidy choreography of traction and setup for the next step.

Attention shifts to the small central incision. The right-hand forceps now evert the left edge as the left-hand driver reorients the needle, adjusts its grasp closer to the ideal segment of the curve, and initiates a new entry on the left margin. Penetration begins cleanly with the needle perpendicular to the dermis, though the sequence cuts away before the exit is shown.

The next view returns to tying. The needle remains parked near the edge while the driver grasps the short end and the right hand presents the long limb for an instrument tie. Throws are formed and seated with alternating counter‑tension, the working distance kept short so the knot tracks straight down the post without excess slack. In the final moments of this knot, a second instrument briefly joins to help tension and align the strands as the square is completed.

There is a short reset with the field quiet. Instruments reappear positioned for the next stitch at the central‑lower slit: the left hand holds the needle driver with the needle properly grasped; the right-hand forceps hover to refine needle orientation and stabilize the target site.

Now the driver moves to the right hand for a pass at the adjacent incision. The left forceps control the exiting tip and lightly oppose the wound edge. The needle is driven along its curvature, then regripped to follow the arc out. Once the suture is delivered, the needle is released and the long strand is pulled diagonally to the upper right, leaving a short tail at the left—an intentional setup for efficient instrument tying.

Tying resumes with the needle clamped and parked off the field. The left-hand driver serves as the post while the right hand loops and transfers the free end for successive throws. Horizontal counter‑traction across the incision sets each throw; the knot squares and sits low on the epidermis. With the knot secure, scissors arrive alongside a stabilizing needle holder to trim the ends to short, neat tails while the holder maintains tension so the knot does not loosen.

The workflow then advances superiorly along the left vertical incision where several simple interrupted sutures are already visible below. The right hand now drives the needle for a new stitch while the left forceps evert the near edge and then guide the exit on the far side. Bites are symmetric and consistent with the prior row. The stitch is pulled through and the instruments transition seamlessly into tying: the left driver posts, the right hand manages the strand, and alternating throws square the knot over the line. After securing, the scissors return to trim the tails while the other instrument stabilizes the knot.

This drive–tie–trim rhythm repeats up the incision. At one point, the operator pauses to trim a previously tied superior knot: the right-hand needle driver grips the suture just lateral to the knot as the left-hand scissors, aligned parallel to the wound, cut the tails to length. A curved needle briefly appears elsewhere in the field but is kept clear and not used in that moment.

Preparation for the next stitch includes deliberate setup: the left driver holds the needle at the proximal/middle third; the right forceps evert the contralateral edge and indicate the target level, ensuring perpendicular entry and a clean path across. The needle passes, the forceps briefly control the tip, and the driver regrips to draw the suture through. Slack is cleared laterally to keep the field open.

Instrument ties continue with the left driver acting as the post and the right hand forming a double first throw followed by alternating single throws to build a square knot. The strands are separated and tensioned in opposite directions after each throw; the knot advances smoothly and seats centrally. Scissors then enter to trim, working between instruments with clear visualization of the knot.

Near the superior end of the row, the left hand again uses the needle holder to pull the suture through a completed pass while the right-hand forceps stabilize the near edge. The needle is moved aside and attention shifts to managing the tails, culminating in a careful trim close to the knot line.

A final superior bite is initiated with the left driver and right forceps working in opposition. After passage, the right hand draws the long suture wide across the upper field as the left hand parks the driver near the wound, arranging the strands for a controlled tie. The last set of instrument ties is executed with measured, alternating tension, the needle still kept off to the side to avoid the knot. An assisting instrument briefly parallels the driver to help tension the loop. The top stitch is cinched, squared, and left with short, even tails.

The closing frames are quiet. For a moment, both gloved hands touch down near the right side of the pad to steady it; no suture manipulation occurs there. The camera lingers on the left-of-center incision now closed with a tidy series of evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures, knots centered and tails trimmed uniformly, with mild, consistent eversion along the repair. Other incisions on the right remain untouched. The overall impression is of a deliberate, repeatable cadence: precise needle drive and roll, clean handoffs, organized pull-through, efficient instrument ties with the needle safely parked, and disciplined trimming—each cycle flowing into the next as the repair progresses methodically from inferior to superior.
