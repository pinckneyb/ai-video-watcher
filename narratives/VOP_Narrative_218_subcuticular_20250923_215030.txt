COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a silicone suture pad marked with multiple reference lines, but only one wound is actually treated from beginning to end. That wound runs along the lower aspect of the pad, beginning at a right‑sided corner where a short vertical extension creates an “L”-shaped step off the main horizontal segment. From there, the laceration continues leftward across the bottom in a gentle curve, with subtle changes in orientation: horizontal near the right corner, slightly curved through the central region, and with short vertical and oblique segments as it approaches the lower‑center and left‑inferior portions. Despite the variety of orientations in the images, the work remains on this single, continuous laceration throughout. Auxiliary marker lines are never engaged; all needle passes, traction, and knotting occur along this one wound.

The surgeon begins at the rightmost corner of the wound, where the horizontal cut meets a short vertical limb. With the right hand controlling a needle driver and the left hand using Adson forceps for counter‑traction, the needle is grasped about two‑thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin surface, and driven through the right lip of the corner. The left hand everts and stabilizes each edge, lifting just enough dermis to protect the tissue as the needle follows its curvature. The pass is completed across to the opposite side, the suture is drawn through, and a crossing strand spans the gap. At this early stage, the technique is careful and deliberate—full‑thickness bites, symmetric margins, and smooth rotational motion matching the arc of the needle. The suture is managed to avoid snagging on the pad’s surface and is redirected superiorly to clear the field.

Staying in this same right‑end corner and moving incrementally leftward, another pass is placed on the same laceration. The right hand continues to drive the needle; the left hand alternates between tissue forceps and a second driver to assist with threading and setup for tying. The bites remain equidistant from the wound edge, balanced in depth and spacing across the two sides to ensure proper approximation. The tissue is not crushed; eversion is maintained with light pickup pressure and precise handling. By the time the next frames appear, an instrument tie is performed directly over the incision: the needle holder serves as the post, and the opposing hand manipulates the free end, forming and advancing loops with controlled, alternating throws. Tension is balanced so the knot seats squarely on top of the incision line without digging into the material, bringing the edges together with slight eversion.

After securing the early stitch, the operator re‑positions along the same wound as it curves gently in the right‑central region. Here the driver shifts to the left hand for a more ergonomic approach to the incision’s curvature, while the right hand manages the pickups. The needle is reloaded at its proximal third, reoriented to keep a perpendicular attack angle, and then advanced across the incision in a smooth arc. The forceps momentarily lift and align the far edge to match the entry point. No tying is shown in this brief sequence; it captures needle loading, entry alignment, and the beginning of the next pass on the same wound.

Continuing along the lower horizontal segment into the left half of the wound, the surgeon places another stitch. The left hand remains on the driver, approaching from the superior‑left to the near edge, and the right hand stabilizes the tissue from the inferior‑right. Each bite follows the consistent pattern seen earlier: perpendicular entry, curvilinear rotation through the dermis, re‑grasp to complete the arc, and safe retrieval. This methodical approach produces well‑balanced purchase on both sides of the wound. Throughout, the suture is kept out of the needle’s path, trailing away from the operative area to prevent entanglement.

The next passage shows a short interval at the same right‑side horizontal corner where the needle is reloaded and repositioned, but no penetration is made. The pickups touch the edge intermittently to orient the margin, while the driver is re‑prepared for an optimal angle. This momentary pause illustrates disciplined setup—ensuring the needle approach remains orthogonal to the tissue to maintain bite symmetry and edge eversion.

The action then returns to the long horizontal midline portion of the same cut, particularly its right third. With the right hand again on the needle driver and the left hand with forceps, another stitch is driven through, the edges are gently everted, and the suture is pulled through. The same precision is maintained: symmetric entry and exit points a few millimeters from the cut edge and a smooth curvilinear trajectory that respects the needle’s shape. No knot is tied in this segment; it depicts the pass and thread delivery.

Further along the lowermost horizontal segment, still on the same laceration, the left hand performs the needle passes while the right hand steadies the far edge. A new stitch is placed at the right end and the thread is brought through, leaving a long tail angled out of the way toward the upper left. The surgeon prepares for the next bite without tying yet—this is a common rhythm: place, manage slack, and set up the next maneuver with careful instrument exchange and reloading while maintaining a clean field.

At the lower center of the pad, where the same wound has a short horizontal stretch, another pass is made. The needle is presented perpendicular to the surface, driven through the near edge, and re‑gripped to exit symmetrically from the far edge. The forceps again provide light eversion and protection for the tissue at the bite sites, and the suture is drawn smoothly across the gap. The driver releases and re‑loads as needed to maintain control and keep the needle oriented properly for subsequent passes.

As the surgeon follows the wound’s contour toward a small vertical jog near the inferior midline, the same disciplined technique continues. The right hand holds the driver; the left hand everts each margin in turn. Symmetric bites are taken on the vertical segment to keep the approximation line straight through the orientation change. The suture is drawn through and left with enough tail to tie securely on the next sequence. Even as the wound changes direction, spacing and bite depth remain consistent to avoid dog‑ears and maintain continuous edge approximation.

Returning briefly to the lower‑right curved segment, the operator places another new stitch and immediately initiates an instrument tie. Both hands coordinate: one stabilizes the “post” limb while the other forms loops and advances them over the post instrument. With alternating throws, the knot is seated directly over the incision, converting the tightened loop into stable edge apposition. The knot lies flat and secure, and the suture is oriented to avoid crossing or torque that might invert the margins.

At the lower center, where the curved guideline meets a small V‑shaped junction in the wound, a new interrupted stitch is placed and fully tied. The left hand uses the Adsons to gently lift each edge as the right hand drives the needle forehand from one side to the other. Multiple instrument throws are then advanced and tightened, drawing the edges into precise contact with minimal tension. Immediately afterward, the left hand switches to scissors and trims the tails, leaving a tidy knot stack with appropriately short ends and preserved eversion.

In the central midline stretch, the next sequence shows knot tying to secure a previously placed pass. The needle has been parked safely while tying proceeds. The two hands alternate roles: one driver acts as the post providing steady counter‑tension, while the other hand’s instrument forms successive loops. Each throw is laid down with attention to direction and tension, so that the knot squarely seats without “seesawing” or loosening. The suture lies transverse to the incision, and as the knot cinches, the edges coapt evenly with a slight, desirable lift at the epidermal margins.

From there the operator works up along the small vertical jog slightly right of center, adding new bites sequentially. The right hand maintains control of the needle, always grasping it at the proximal third and keeping the trajectory perpendicular to the skin. The left hand alternates between lifting the far edge and managing the thread. Each pass is snugged to remove slack, and tension is adjusted to maintain a uniform approximation line. The spacing is regular; depth is matched across each edge; and the line of closure stays straight through the vertical segment before the wound curves again.

Next, attention shifts along the same laceration as it transitions into a diagonal run in the lower‑left quadrant. The left hand now holds the driver for a more ergonomic angle of approach from the left side, with the right hand alternating between forceps and managing the free suture end. The needle is again reloaded at its proximal third, and the arc is followed through the tissue, perpendicular to the surface. The assistant hand gives slight countertraction and eversion where the diagonal begins, and the suture is drawn through to manage slack. No tying is shown in this short segment, which focuses on needle positioning and passage along the diagonal.

At the left end of the inferior curve, a stitch is placed and secured. The driver holds the knot area steady while the opposite hand brings in scissors to trim the tails. This sequence underscores consistent technique: a secure knot placed directly over the incision, edges drawn flush with subtle eversion, and tails cut to a modest length that won’t irritate or catch. The needle is then repositioned to continue along the same incision, following its contour back toward the central portion as needed.

Shortly after, the surgeon revisits a small gap at the right end of the bottom incision to place another pass. The right hand holds the driver; the left hand gently lifts the near and then far edge to guide the needle safely through both sides. The bites are symmetric and taken at a consistent distance from the margin, reinforcing the uniformity of the closure along the entire wound. This pass is not tied within this snippet, but it follows the same meticulous pattern seen elsewhere in the procedure.

Near the lower‑left apex of the oblique segment, another stitch is completed, tensioned, and the tails are trimmed. The nondominant hand remains close to the inferior apex, stabilizing the tissue during both needle passage and cutting, while the dominant hand crosses the wound path as needed to deliver the needle and then switch to scissors. This secures the far end of the laceration, making the leftmost segment as neatly approximated as the right corner where the work began.

There is then a brief pause in which no tissue is manipulated and no incision is engaged. The hands hover at the sides of the field, and instruments rest idle. This appears to be a repositioning moment—confirming suture security, assessing alignment, or preparing to continue—without any change in the operative target. When work resumes, it remains on the same laceration as before.

Throughout the case, the hand positions evolve in service of the wound’s geometry while remaining consistent in principle. The driver switches between hands to maintain an orthogonal needle approach and to keep the wrist in a comfortable, controlled range of motion. The non‑driving hand almost always provides eversion and stabilization with Adson forceps, grasping lightly at the dermal edge to present the tissue. During ties, the hands separate along the line to create a clear post and a maneuvering limb; as throws are advanced, they converge to seat the knot precisely over the incision. Scissors appear only after a knot is secure, and tails are trimmed cleanly without disturbing the approximation.

The needle handling is textbook throughout: grasped at the proximal third or about two‑thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the wound edge, and advanced via controlled wrist rotation that follows the needle’s arc. When needed, the needle is re‑gripped mid‑pass to complete the curve and retrieve it on the far side. The surgeon avoids torqueing the needle or “drilling” through tissue. Entry and exit points are matched in depth and distance from the edge to maintain a straight line of closure across each segment, whether horizontal, vertical, curved, or oblique.

Tissue handling remains gentle and purposeful. The forceps stabilize without crushing; eversion is kept subtle but consistent. Traction on the suture is moderated so the knots seat without strangulating the edges. When tying, the driver acting as a post holds the limb steady while the opposite hand forms loops; throws are alternating to lock securely and maintain a flat, square knot. Knots are centered directly over the incision rather than off to the side, and tails are cut to a uniform, appropriate length.

Although a few frames depict setup, reloading, or a short idle interval without a visible bite or tie, these do not reflect a change of target or technique—only the natural cadence of suturing a single, multi‑segment laceration with variable orientation. When the camera shows different portions of the same cut—right corner with an L‑shaped step, long horizontal midline stretch, a short vertical jog near the inferior midline, and a diagonal turn into the lower‑left quadrant—the operative behavior remains consistent: symmetric bites, perpendicular needle travel, careful loop management, and instrument ties that seat knots directly over the line.

By the end of the sequence, the laceration along the lower aspect of the pad is brought together with a series of well‑spaced interrupted stitches. Early stitches at the right corner are secured and trimmed; central stitches are placed and tied with careful approximation; vertical and diagonal turns are closed with the same symmetry and eversion; and the leftmost apex is secured, with tails cut cleanly. The final state is a continuous, evenly approximated closure following the entire length of the wound’s contour. The edges meet neatly with slight eversion, knots are neatly stacked over the incision, and the suture lies free of tangles or undue tension, leaving a tidy, consistent repair from the right corner across the bottom and into the left‑inferior segment of the same laceration.
