Pattern: Vertical Mattress

Summative assessment:
Six completed sutures were placed with clean technique, consistent perpendicular needle handling, square knots, and careful trimming. The wound edges were well approximated with slight eversion, spacing was orderly, and instrument control was disciplined. Time and motion economy were strong, reflecting good procedural planning and steady hand coordination. However, as a vertical mattress repair, this fell short: there were no far-far/near-near paired passes, no layered deep support, and thus none of the intended tension-sharing or robust eversion typical of this pattern. If you intend a true vertical mattress, you must execute the deep far-far bites (further from the edge and deeper), followed by the superficial near-near bites (closer to the edge) before tying, so the deep loop bears tension and the superficial loop approximates the epidermis without blanching. The fundamentals of handling and knot security are solid; now match the pass geometry to the stated technique.
