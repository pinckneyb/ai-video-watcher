COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses on closing a single wound: the long, straight vertical incision running down the middle of a three‑slit suture pad. The two lateral slits are never manipulated. Work proceeds on this midline cut from its inferior segment upward, using the selected interrupted technique with standard instrument handling—needle holder and Adson forceps—and consistent attention to perpendicular needle orientation, symmetric bite depth, and edge eversion. Throughout the case, the operator alternates which hand drives the needle and occasionally brings in scissors to trim, but the line being closed remains the same central incision from start to finish.

Initial placement begins near the inferior end of the wound. The left hand controls the needle driver and the right hand uses the pickups to elevate the right wound edge, everting the dermis for accurate entry. With the needle grasped about two‑thirds from the tip and held perpendicular to the skin, the first pass is taken from the right edge across to the left at the lower portion of the central slit. The pass follows the curve of the needle through the dermis/subcutis, and the thread is pulled across the gap without tying. The forceps are used carefully—grasping the dermal edge to present tissue while avoiding crush—so that the entry is a clean, perpendicular bite a few millimeters from the margin. The suture tail trails toward the operator’s right, marking the start of an interrupted closure sequence but leaving the knot for the next step.

Immediately afterward, the first completed stitch is secured at the lower‑to‑mid portion of the incision. The left hand keeps the needle driver, and the right hand alternates between the forceps and managing the suture tail. Throws are formed with controlled, opposing tension. The knot is centered over the incision and cinched to bring the edges together with slight eversion. Once secure, the needle is reloaded for the next pass. At this point, one completed suture is present on the central line.

Moving superiorly, a new bite is placed across the central slit. For this pass the right hand takes the needle driver while the left hand maneuvers the forceps, indicating the operator can work ambidextrously. The needle is still grasped at the proximal third and driven perpendicularly, following the arc across both edges. The thread is drawn through and tensioned, but no knot is tied in this interval. Scissors are briefly brought into the field but not yet used. The camera’s crop in this segment momentarily suggests no prior stitches; however, earlier frames have already documented one completed knot inferiorly. The work continues with the same central line, the previously tied stitch remaining just outside the immediate field of view.

The right‑hand driver continues for another pass, with the left hand alternating between pickups and using an index finger to guide and tension the suture. The needle follows its curve through the near edge and then the far edge; the strand is drawn through cleanly. Again, this sequence is about placing and pulling through rather than tying. The pickups help maintain gentle eversion at entry and exit points, and the needle holder tip is occasionally used to guide the arc so the exit is symmetric and at an appropriate depth.

Attention returns to the inferior end, where the left hand again holds the needle driver and the right hand the forceps. The forceps lift the right dermal edge, and a pass is taken across to the left at approximately 2–3 mm from the wound margin. The operator keeps the needle perpendicular and the bite depth moderate to capture the dermis without excessive subcutaneous tissue. The needle is re‑grasped on exit as needed for mechanical advantage, and the suture is pulled through, forming a loop across the wound; tying is deferred. The hands stay close and parallel to the wound, straddling the incision to control the suture and tissue.

A similar sequence is carried out at the mid‑portion of the incision. The left hand drives the needle, and the right hand with the Adson forceps stabilizes first the far edge and then the near edge to assist a smooth, controlled arc from near to far, followed by retrieval and pull‑through. The edges are everted gently and presented just enough to allow a precise, perpendicular bite. The pass is completed, and the suture rests across the gap. Up to this point in the midline, several passes have been placed without tying; the earlier inferior knot remains the only completed stitch.

Next, a pass is placed, pulled through, and tied centrally, bringing the wound edges together at the midline. The left hand remains on the needle driver and the right on the forceps. The forceps intermittently lift the right edge to expose dermis for needle placement and then help retrieve the needle on the far side. After the pass, the operator performs instrument ties, alternating direction to secure a square knot. This adds a second completed stitch to the central closure and visibly approximates the local wound edges with a slight, controlled eversion.

Additional passes are then laid in the midline without immediately tying. The left hand keeps the needle holder, maintaining a grip about one‑third back from the needle tip to preserve a perpendicular approach. The right hand stabilizes tissue and occasionally re‑grips the needle tip as it emerges. The suture strand often arcs broadly across the pad, with the free end trailing toward the operator’s right. As the needle is advanced near‑to‑far through one edge and then the other, the camera shows the driver crossing the incision, the forceps opposing it, and both instruments working millimeters from the wound margins to keep the bites symmetric and at consistent depth.

As the repair progresses into the upper third of the incision, the lower two‑thirds become visibly approximated by previously tied stitches. Three completed sutures are now visible along the mid‑to‑lower segment. The operator places another bite at the superior open segment, again with perpendicular entry and an arc driven from the right (far) edge toward the left (near) edge. The forceps in the right hand elevate and evert the far edge during the first bite, then switch sides to present the opposite edge for the reciprocal bite. The new pass is not yet tied at this moment; the three inferior stitches maintain apposition of the lower wound.

Soon after, the count increases to four completed stitches at the start of a subsequent sequence, indicating that one of the previously placed passes has been tied in the interval. With this foundation, another pass is placed but not tied. Throughout these upper‑segment placements, the left hand alternates between the needle driver and scissors, while the right hand keeps the Adson forceps on the tissue margin. The driver crosses the incision to the contralateral side as the forceps lift and evert the edge being entered or exited. Bite placement remains consistent—moderate‑depth dermal capture on each side, equidistant from the margins, and with a near‑perpendicular approach to favor eversion.

At the superior end, the operator then places and ties an additional stitch. The left hand maintains the driver just inferior to the forceps, which are elevating the right/superior wound edge. The needle is driven in a controlled arc across the wound, and after the suture is pulled through, throws are formed to secure the knot. In a tight, cropped field at this stage, two completed stitches are visible inferiorly in view, and after tying there are three in that cropped frame. Given the earlier broader views showing more knots below, this localized count reflects field‑of‑view limitations, not a change in the single line being repaired. The work remains on the same midline incision, and the previously tied inferior sutures are simply outside the camera’s immediate focus.

The next sequence emphasizes instrument tie technique at the superior‑mid portion. The left hand with the needle holder forms loops for the throws while the right hand manages the tail and steadies the tissue with light forceps contact. The knot is cinched with opposite directional pulls to lay flat and secure, finalizing another interrupted stitch. By the end of this interval, four completed stitches are visible along the incision in the field.

With four knots in place, the operator secures yet another superior stitch. The left hand with the needle driver forms the throws, the right hand controls the free end, and the knot is advanced and set. This step brings the visible count from four to five in that moment. The edges remain slightly everted with good dermal capture, and minimal direct tissue manipulation is used during tying; approximation is accomplished by the suture tension itself. The driver crosses above the wound during the throws, then releases once the knot is seated.

Immediately around this time, another view shows a pass placed just below a superior knot, with only one completed stitch visible in the tight frame and additional sub‑bites present but not tied in that specific sequence. This momentary discrepancy relative to the broader count from the preceding step is best explained by the camera’s tight zoom on the very top of the wound and the exclusion of the inferior field. The technique and incision remain the same; the operator is simply working on the same central line at a different zoom level.

The case concludes with top‑end finalization. The right hand tensions the suture end on the superior‑most stitch while the left hand brings in scissors/needle driver to prepare for trimming. No new needle passes are taken. The movement is limited to cinching and cutting the ends of the top stitch. Hands remain parallel and close to the superior third of the wound, with the instruments straddling the incision line. The lateral slits on the pad are again visible and remain untouched, reinforcing that all work has been confined to a single midline closure.

Hand position and instrument handling evolve predictably throughout. Early on, the left hand is the primary driver with the right hand managing forceps. Midway, the right hand occasionally assumes the driver role for placement while the left hand uses pickups, demonstrating bidextrous control. During tying phases, the left hand commonly uses the needle holder to perform instrument ties while the right hand manages the tail and provides gentle counter‑traction across the wound. Scissors appear later for trimming, usually in the left hand while the right hand holds tension on the free end. Across all phases, the instruments oppose each other over the incision, their tips meeting just millimeters from the wound edges to maintain precision. The needle is almost always held at the proximal third to middle of its curve, oriented near‑perpendicular to the skin so that its arc follows the tissue plane. The forceps are used to evert and stabilize rather than crush, and bite placement is generally symmetric and at a moderate depth within the dermis/subdermis, fostering reliable edge approximation and slight eversion.

Technique remains consistent with the selected interrupted closure throughout. Each stitch is conceived as a discrete unit: a near‑perpendicular pass through one edge at a measured distance from the margin, a reciprocal pass through the opposite edge at a mirrored depth and offset, pull‑through to remove slack while maintaining edge eversion, then throws laid with alternating direction and opposing traction to produce a square knot that sits just atop the epidermis. When trimming is performed, it is done after the knot is set and the edges are stable, with tails cut to a reasonable length.

Suture progression and counting, tracked across the entire video and reconciled with occasional field‑of‑view limitations, unfolds as follows. The first pass is placed inferiorly and then tied, bringing the count to one. Multiple passes are then placed without tying as the operator advances up the line; a central pass is tied next, increasing the count to two. As work continues into the upper third, three completed stitches become visible along the mid‑to‑lower portion, and then a fourth is tied. A tying sequence later in the superior segment shows a fifth stitch being secured at that moment. However, the final camera view focuses tightly on the top end while the operator tensions and trims the superior‑most stitch; within that last field, four completed sutures are visible along the midline. Given the instruction to base the final tally on what is actually visible in the concluding frames, the definitive end‑state count is determined from that final view.

Final verification
- The procedure results in four completed sutures visible in the last frames.
- Progression by observation: 0 after the very first pass; 1 after the first knot at the lower‑mid segment; 2 after the central tie; 3 and then 4 as additional stitches are tied while advancing superiorly; a fifth is tied in one mid‑to‑late sequence but is not visible in the final cropped view; the final visible count, taken strictly from the concluding frames where the top stitch is cinched and cut, is four.
- The central vertical incision, and only this incision, is worked from the inferior portion toward the superior third with consistent perpendicular bite orientation, forceps‑assisted eversion, and instrument‑tied knots.
- The final state shows the midline approximated with four knots evident in view, tails trimmed on the superior‑most stitch, and the lateral slits untouched throughout.

Any intermittent discrepancies in intermediate counts reflect camera framing rather than a change in the single suture line or the technique itself. The line is closed in a stepwise, interrupted fashion from bottom to top, with the last view confirming four completed stitches visible at the conclusion.
