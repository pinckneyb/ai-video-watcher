COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure focuses entirely on the left-most vertical incision of the practice pad — the medial-most of three parallel linear defects on the model — and that single wound is addressed from the start of the recording through the end. The operator works methodically along the length of this one vertical incision, placing and securing a series of individual interrupted stitches to restore approximation of the synthetic epidermal/dermal edges. Throughout the case the team uses a conventional two-handed, instrument-based technique: a needle driver to control the curved suture needle and a counter-instrument (tissue forceps, Adson pickup or hemostat) to stabilize, evert, and present the wound edge.

Initial approach and first passes (0–60 s)
At the outset the left-most vertical incision is inspected and the first stitches are planned around preexisting entry/exit points. The operator positions both hands closely over the left column of the pad, with the needle driver held in the dominant hand and toothed forceps in the nondominant hand. The curved suture needle is repeatedly grasped in the needle driver roughly at mid‑shaft or slightly toward the tip (depending on the bite), and the driver is used to rotate the needle through controlled arcs. The non-dominant forceps tent and evert the near edge, providing counter-traction to expose the dermal layer and align the epidermal lips.

Needle trajectories are generally short, dermal-to-dermal arcs taken immediately adjacent to the wound margin so that each bite captures epidermis and superficial dermis. The operator favors small, symmetrical bites with slight eversion at each entry/exit to achieve apposition of the skin edges on this simulated tissue. Early sequences show a suture passed through one side, drawn across the gap, and prepared for subsequent knotting — an interrupted, through-and-through style approach consistent with placement of individual stitches rather than a continuous running line.

Systematic interrupted placement and progression (60–240 s)
After the initial bite is placed, the operator proceeds to place additional interrupted sutures along the same vertical incision in a stepwise manner. Hands remain close to the wound (typically 1–4 cm apart), working in opposition: the needle driver approaches from a slightly medial/cephalad or lateral/caudal angle depending on the exact bite location, while the forceps hold the opposite edge. The instrument shafts generally converge over the incision at gentle angles (commonly 30–60°), facilitating controlled needle transfer and retrieval.

Across this phase the pattern is consistent: reposition the forceps to present the next bite, grasp the needle about mid‑shaft in the driver, drive the curved needle through the far edge in a controlled arc, retrieve the tip with the forceps (or draw the suture tail through), and then manage the loop for knot-tying. The operator sometimes re-grasps the needle nearer the tip when a tighter curve is needed to negotiate a shallow entry or to withdraw the tip cleanly. The bites are kept superficial — focused on dermal capture without deep fascial bites — and tensioning is adjusted to bring the wound edges into close apposition with slight, purposeful eversion.

As stitches are added, knots are tightened in sequence and suture tails are handled with fine pickups or short scissors. Several frames show the operator pausing to secure and trim tails before proceeding, indicating an organized cycle of pass → tie → trim. At times the operator appears to begin a new bite distal to a recently tied stitch and later returns to adjust tension or re-locate the next bite — an efficient, local sequence that keeps the work concentrated to the same incision line.

Mid-procedure refinement, knot work and occasional instrument changes (240–420 s)
Through the mid-portion of the recording the left incision contains multiple closely spaced interrupted stitches. The operator concentrates on filling the remaining open segments and reinforcing approximations that show slight gapping or eversion variation. Hand roles remain stable: one hand remains the primary needle driver (usually the operator’s dominant hand), the other maintains tissue control and manipulates suture tails. Instrument grips are fluid — sometimes the needle is held mid‑shaft for a full pass, other times nearer the body for precise withdrawal or when negotiating a shallow edge.

Knot-tying sequences become more prominent in this phase. Many frames document tightening of loops, additional throws for security, and trimming of short tails. The operator intermittently uses a small pair of scissors or a suture cutter to snip tails immediately after knot security is visually confirmed. The left incision is closed in a staggered fashion: the operator alternates placement and tying where necessary — adding a bite, securing it, then moving along the line to the next open segment. This measured cadence ensures consistent eversion and uniform spacing of the interrupted stitches.

Throughout, the synthetic skin is treated gently: the forceps provide only enough traction to tent the edge and evert the dermis; no aggressive undermining or deep tissue manipulation is employed. The needle trajectory remains a smooth needle-driving arc, with controlled rotation of the driver to favor tissue-friendly penetration and to avoid tearing the model’s surface.

Approaching completion — final passes and adjustments (420–600 s)
As the number of interrupted sutures along the left incision increases, the operator transitions to final passes at the superior and inferior bounds of the wound. Hand positions become even more tightly clustered around the closure site — instrument tips are often within 1–3 cm of one another — to permit precise last bites and knot‑security maneuvers. The non-dominant forceps frequently rest immediately lateral to the incision to stabilize the edge while the dominant hand advances the needle.

Several frames depict the operator placing the last few interrupted stitches in the remaining gaps and then immediately tensioning and securing these with meticulous knot-tying technique. At times the needle is withdrawn and repositioned in the driver to complete a short, shallow withdrawal arc; other moments show suture tails being managed with a second instrument while the driver readies for the next throw. The visual result through this phase is a line of even, closely spaced interrupted sutures approximating the skin edges with mild eversion and no obvious wide gaping.

There is occasional brief alternation in the hand-instrument pairing: on a few frames the left hand momentarily takes the needle driver while the right hand steadies tissue, but this is transient and the two-handed, instrument‑based technique persists. One frame sequence shows a configuration that resembles advancement of a continuous suture loop, but this appearance is fleeting and the dominant, consistent technique throughout remains placement of individual interrupted stitches. That small inconsistency does not indicate a change in overall approach; rather, it reflects transient variation in how the needle and suture were held during a tight area of closure.

Finalization, trimming and inspection (600–705 s)
In the latter portion of the recording the operator focuses exclusively on securing knot integrity and tidying the suture line. Multiple frames show the left-most incision now carrying a row of tied knots with short suture tails; the wounds exhibit consistent apposition with slight eversion where knots pull the edges together. The operator performs final tightening adjustments, uses scissors or a small cutter to trim tails close to the knots, and smooths adjacent tissue with forceps to assess approximation.

Hand positions at the conclusion are clustered immediately over the superior aspect of the left incision: one hand holds short instruments to manipulate and cut suture tails while the other supports the tissue or holds the suture steady. The very final frames show a gloved hand above the left incision with no needle visible, confirming that all passes have been completed and remaining motion is knot control and trimming.

Spatial relationships and instrument mechanics throughout
Across the entire case the interrelationship of hands and instruments is consistent and tightly coordinated. The needle driver is repeatedly positioned slightly above or to the medial side of the incision, advancing the curved needle in short rotational arcs across the wound margin. The counter‑instrument (variously described as Adson or toothed forceps, a Kelly clamp, or simple pickups) is positioned lateral/inferior to the bite to present and evert the edge. Instrument tips converge over the working site at shallow angles to optimize needle entry and retrieval; hand spacing varies between about 1–6 cm depending on whether the operator is placing a bite, tying a knot, or trimming a tail. Grip adjustments on the needle vary according to the bite demanded by local tissue geometry: the operator commonly grasps the needle at mid‑shaft for full passes and nearer the tip when withdrawing or threading through a tight corner.

Technique consistency and evolution
From beginning to end the technique is a disciplined, interrupted-stitch approach. Needle handling demonstrates standard surgical needle-driving mechanics: mid-shaft grips for control, rotation of the wrist and driver to follow the needle curve, and short dermal bites designed to produce slight eversion for aesthetic skin apposition. Knotting technique is regular and secure, and suture tails are trimmed promptly. Over time the operator’s movements become more compact and deliberate as more stitches are secured: early passes involve more gross positioning, while later stages are dominated by fine knot work and trimming.

A few brief frames hint at procedural variation (a transient continuous-loop appearance, or occasional grip at a different needle position); these do not supplant the overarching interrupted pattern. Instead, they reflect practical, momentary adaptations made to optimize needle retrieval or suture tension on a constrained training model.

Final condition of the closure
At the end of the procedure the left-most vertical incision is closed with a continuous series of completed interrupted sutures spaced evenly along its length. The wound edges are closely approximated with consistent slight eversion at each bite, resulting in good dermal-to-dermal contact. Tied knots lie along the incision with short trimmed tails; no instrument activity is visible passing a needle through fresh tissue in the closing frames. The overall appearance is of a carefully executed, instrument-based interrupted closure: small dermal bites that approximate the epidermis, secure knot-tying and efficient tail management, and no evidence of deep tissue capture or undermining. Minor puckering at a few knots and slight variation in eversion are present but within typical expectations for practice-model suturing and are addressed by targeted tension adjustments during the final knot-tying sequence.

Summary
Throughout the video the operator confines all activity to the left-most vertical incision and proceeds in a methodical stitch-by-stitch approach: presenting the edge with forceps, driving a curved needle with a needle driver using mid‑shaft grips and controlled rotation, pulling the suture through, tying secure interrupted knots, trimming tails, and advancing along the line until closure is complete. Hand positions and instrument relationships evolve from general placement to focused knot work, but the technique remains consistent — interrupted dermal closure with attention to eversion and close apposition — culminating in a neatly approximated incision with secured knots and trimmed suture tails.
