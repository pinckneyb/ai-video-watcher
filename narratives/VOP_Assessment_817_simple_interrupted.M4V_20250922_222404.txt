COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a continuous closure of a single vertical skin incision on the left side of the pad, beginning at its inferior end and progressing steadily toward the superior end. The operator employs a simple interrupted technique throughout, alternating between precise needle passes and instrument ties, with periodic tail trimming to complete each stitch before advancing to the next bite. Although nearby slits are visible on the model, only this one line is worked from start to finish; the apparent shifts in viewpoint and descriptors reflect movement along the same wound rather than a change of site.

The case opens with careful set‑up at the inferior pole. With the incision gaping slightly at the lower-left quadrant of the field, the left hand controls a needle driver and the right hand uses tissue forceps to present tissue. The needle is loaded properly—grasped about two-thirds from the tip and oriented perpendicular to the pad—so its arc will traverse the skin in a controlled, wrist-driven motion. The forceps evert the near edge lightly, avoiding crush, while the needle tip is aligned to enter close to the margin. This initial positioning sets the tone for consistent, perpendicular needle work and edge-friendly handling that repeats over the remainder of the closure.

Once aligned, the first pass is executed. The driver remains just to the left of the slit; the forceps, from the right, alternately stabilize the near and far edges to present each side for entry and exit. The needle is advanced through the near lip and then retrieved and reloaded to cross to the far lip. The suture is pulled through, leaving a long free strand draped across the field; no knot is tied immediately. The hands form a compact working triangle over the wound—driver lateral, forceps medial—maintaining visibility and control.

With the first bite laid, the operator transitions to knot tying. The needle is now out of play; the driver grasps the standing portion of the suture near the wound while the other hand manipulates the free tail. Using the driver as the tying instrument, standard instrument throws are formed and gently cinched to seat the knot at the left margin of the slit. This approach—parking the needle and using the driver to control the suture rather than the needle—recurs throughout the procedure. The knot is advanced squarely over the incision, tightened without excessive blanching, and then the tails are trimmed with scissors introduced from the left, blades aligned parallel to the incision to cut close without jeopardizing knot integrity. The driver provides counter-tension on the strand as the scissors cut, keeping the knot stable.

A brief interval of strand management follows, with no new tissue passes. The operator repositions the suture and instruments, assuring the field is clear and the prior knot lies neatly at the inferior pole. Then the second stitch is established just superior to the first. The driver, again from the left, and the forceps, from the right, straddle the wound a few millimeters above the previous knot. The needle is loaded perpendicular to the skin and passed in a smooth arc; the forceps intermittently guide the needle tip and maintain gentle eversion of each margin. As the suture is drawn through, the edges approximate without gapping. The needle is parked and an instrument tie follows: the driver grasping the standing strand, the other hand directing the tail, with successive throws alternating direction to square the knot. The throws are seated carefully on the wound surface, aligning tension with the long axis of the incision. After the knot is secure, the tails are trimmed.

The sequence repeats with another pass immediately above, this time without forceps assistance; edge control depends on the needle trajectory and suture tension. The driver regrips the needle as needed to deliver it through both sides and then parks the needle superior to the wound while the strand is drawn through. The knot is set with the driver holding the suture rather than the needle, and the tails are cut. A subsequent pass is performed with the driver working from the operator’s right side and the assisting hand now using forceps to retrieve the suture and draw it through. Again, the bite is symmetric and near the margin, aimed at maintaining even approximation. The stitch is tied with an instrument tie, seated directly over the slit, and trimmed.

By this point the inferior portion of the line shows a small series of evenly spaced simple interrupted knots with short tails, the edges neatly coapted. The operator continues upward, tying and trimming a fresh knot along the mid portion of the incision. The driver, parallel to the wound and just to its right, tensions the standing limb while scissors approach from the left to cut. With each completed stitch, instruments withdraw briefly before re-approach at the next superior site.

The focus then shifts to the more central segment of the same vertical incision, where the lower half is now dotted with completed stitches and the superior portion remains open. The technique remains consistent: a loaded needle in the driver’s jaws (proximal third to midshaft grip, perpendicular orientation) and forceps in the opposite hand to present tissue. The forceps gently evert one margin at a time and assist with needle recovery. Bites are taken a few millimeters from the edge and mirror one another across the gap to maintain symmetry. The needle is driven with controlled wrist rotation; the pass crosses cleanly, and the suture is advanced through.

As soon as the pass is complete, the driver transitions from needle control to suture control for tying. The needle itself is often parked off to the right while the driver and the free hand work the throws. Instrument ties are laid methodically, alternating direction to address the previous loop’s lay, and the knot is brought down squarely over the incision. Tension is applied evenly across the wound, tenting the edges only slightly before relaxing into coaptation, a pattern repeated in all subsequent ties. The throws are tightened just enough to secure without crushing tissue. After each knot is completed, the driver may hold the standing limb to stabilize the knot while scissors approach, parallel to the wound, to trim both tails short.

The operator continues this rhythm as the line advances superiorly. The driver often approaches from the left of the wound, the forceps from the right, creating a predictable instrument choreography. On preparation for each new stitch near the top of the closed segment, the forceps hover at the target edge to control entry, while the driver aligns the needle perpendicular to the skin surface. In some sequences, the pass is captured: the needle enters the near edge on the left-of-center wound, arcs through the dermis, and emerges on the far side with the forceps assisting in retrieval. The suture is pulled through and slack is managed by drawing the free limb laterally and superiorly to maintain a clear field.

At intervals, when a pass has already been made and the suture lies through both edges, the next step is tying. These frames show the driver grasping the suture rather than the needle, and the opposite hand manipulating the free end. Throws are formed around the driver, the loops are drawn across the incision to seat, and the knot is snugged down, sometimes causing a brief, controlled tenting of the wound edges that settles as the knot is squared. The operator maintains the driver just to the left or right of the incision—consistent, parallel alignment helps keep the knot centered. No new bites are taken during these tying intervals; the wound edges already approximated by the pass are brought flush as the throws cinch down.

Periodically, completion work is done: the knot is positioned precisely at the top of the newly placed stitch and the ends are trimmed. The needle driver may grasp the standing limb a few millimeters from the knot to stabilize it while the scissors approach from the opposite side. The scissor blades are oriented parallel to the incision to prevent inadvertently lifting the knot; cuts are made close enough to leave short, neat tails. After trimming, instruments withdraw, revealing a clean row of knots with even spacing.

As the closure enters the superior third, the same deliberate approach continues. The driver loads the needle at the proximal third, perpendicular to the skin, and the forceps elevate and evert the superior wound edge. Small, symmetric bites are taken to produce slight edge eversion as the suture is drawn through. The suture is then used to perform an instrument tie at the top of the incision, eliminating the small gap that remained. The right hand often controls the suture loop with the driver, while the left hand manages the free end, looping and exchanging as needed to alternate throw direction. The knot is tightened carefully, and the edges remain aligned without gapping.

Subsequent sequences in this superior region show additional preparation and passes: the driver stationed just left of the apex and the forceps hovering over the right margin. The needle is guided into the next site with a smooth arc, forceps assisting in presenting the tissue and recovering the needle. Slack is pulled through and the strand is directed away from the field. Instrument ties follow, with the driver now primarily a suture manipulator. These ties are cinched and seated directly onto the wound surface. The edges tent slightly as the throws tighten, then relax as the knot is squared. No forceps are used during these tying segments; all tissue control is indirect via suture tension.

When a stitch is completed at the top, trimming ensues. The driver remains close, perpendicular to the incision, gently tensioning the suture proximal to the knot; scissors approach from the opposite side, blades aligned parallel to the wound, and tails are cut short. Each trimming step leaves the wound looking progressively tidier, with consistent tail length and knot placement.

Approaching the last bit of open skin at the apex, the operator executes another pass. The driver and forceps again straddle the wound, the needle is driven across with a clean 90-degree approach, and the forceps aid in eversion and retrieval. The suture is drawn through, and an instrument tie is initiated immediately, alternating throws to secure the stitch that closes the small remaining gap. The knot is seated squarely at the top of the incision. Once secure, the ends are trimmed with the same scissor technique—parallel approach, tips close to the knot, and minimal movement to avoid disturbing the closure.

The final stages are largely confirmatory and finishing touches. With the most superior stitch secured and tails trimmed, the closure displays a line of evenly spaced simple interrupted knots along the left-of-center vertical wound, each with short, neat tails. The edges are well approximated with mild, intentional eversion and slight puckering near the most recent knots—expected after fresh throws have been cinched down. No new passes are made. Hands occasionally hover near the wound without altering suture tension, confirming stability. Other nearby slits remain untouched throughout.

Across the entire procedure, several technical themes remain consistent:

- Needle handling: The needle is consistently grasped about one-third to two-thirds from its tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin to drive a proper arc. The driver uses small wrist rotations rather than sweeping motions, promoting precise entry and exit points. When tying, the needle is parked safely, and the driver grasps the suture rather than the needle.

- Tissue handling: The forceps, when used, lift and evert the dermal edge lightly, avoiding crush. Bites are small and symmetric, a few millimeters from the margin, to balance strength and cosmetic apposition. Where forceps are not used, the operator relies on needle trajectory and suture tension to maintain approximation and slight eversion.

- Tying technique: All knots are instrument ties built from multiple sequential throws, alternated to square the knot. The driver tip often straddles the knot site, and tension is directed in line with the wound to seat throws without lateral displacement. Tying occurs with the edges already approximated by the pass, minimizing tissue trauma.

- Spatial control: The driver typically operates lateral to the wound (often from the left), while forceps oppose from the right, creating a stable working triangle over the incision. During tying, the hands converge over the knot, then separate to seat and square it. For trimming, one instrument stabilizes the suture while scissors approach from the opposite side with blades parallel to the incision.

- Workflow: Each stitch follows a repeatable cycle—prepare and pass, draw suture through, tie, trim—before the operator advances a few millimeters superiorly to the next site. Periods of strand management occur between steps to keep the field tidy and maintain line tension.

- Consistency and refinements: As the closure progresses from the inferior end toward the top, the operator maintains the same simple interrupted pattern. Minor variations—such as tying without forceps at hand or momentarily parking the needle out of frame—do not alter the core technique. When trimming, counter-tension is consistently applied on the standing limb to keep the knot stable.

At conclusion, the left-sided vertical incision is closed along its length with a uniform series of simple interrupted sutures. The knots sit neatly on the surface with short tails, the edges are coapted with mild eversion, and the superior end—initially gaping—has been closed with the final ties and trimmed tails. There is no further manipulation in the final moments; the hands hover briefly near the line without changing tension, and the closure remains intact, orderly, and complete.
