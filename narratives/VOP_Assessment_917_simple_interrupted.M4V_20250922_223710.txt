COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely in the upper-left quadrant of the practice pad, focused on closing a short, narrow vertical skin incision. From first entry to the final overview, the operator consistently returns to this one small wound, building a line of simple interrupted sutures that approximate the edges with gentle eversion and leave knots and tails positioned to the left of the incision.

Initial approach and first placement (0–29 s)
The opening moments show the surgeon establishing a steady, reproducible workflow at the superior end of the small vertical slit. A needle driver approaches from the left while forceps work from the right, their tips hovering just millimeters from the wound edges. The needle is loaded at the distal-to-middle third on its body, oriented perpendicular to the pad surface to encourage a controlled arc through the dermis. The forceps stabilize and slightly lift the left wound margin at the intended entry, helping to present the tissue and achieve a symmetric bite.

The driver then advances the needle into the near (left) edge, the forceps intercept the needle tip as it emerges, and the instrument pair regrips to continue the curve across the gap and into the far (right) edge. Wrist rotation completes a smooth passage, and the suture is drawn through, leaving a strand traversing the wound. With this first bite in, the right-hand instrument transitions from tissue handling to assisting with suture management, pulling slack superiorly to clear the field while the left hand repositions in preparation for tying.

Early knot tying and orientation confirmation (30–44 s)
With the initial stitch in place, the operator proceeds to tie using an instrument technique. Both hands employ needle holders for the throws, maintaining the knot directly over the small wound. The left instrument secures the short tail close to the incision, while the right instrument manipulates the longer standing limb, which still carries the needle and is kept to the far right of the field to avoid accidental needle strikes. Successive throws are placed in a square, alternating manner, and tension is applied laterally to seat the knot down snugly. No new needle passages occur in this interval; the effort is entirely on securing the stitch just placed. Although in this brief segment the wound is described as a small transverse slit between longer vertical incisions, the location and context match the same upper-left field, and every subsequent sequence returns to the short vertical incision in this area. No other incision receives active suturing.

Setting up the next pass (45–74 s)
After trimming the tails of the first knot, attention returns immediately to the same small vertical cut. The left hand holds the needle driver just left of the wound, and the right hand brings in tissue forceps from the right. A new needle is grasped at about two-thirds from the tip, again oriented perpendicular to the pad surface for a controlled dermal pass. The forceps gently evert the left edge, and the needle is aimed to enter the left lip. The driver releases and regrips partway through the motion to maintain an optimal angle for extraction. The forceps guide the tip as it exits, and the arc continues across the wound and through the opposite edge. The suture is drawn through deliberately to avoid tearing or crushing the synthetic tissue.

Building the line superiorly (75–104 s)
Work continues along the same incision, now just above the existing stitch. The left hand frequently maintains control of the driver while the right hand alternates between forceps and suture management. The forceps intermittently pick up and evert each wound lip as the needle is driven through paired entry and exit points at symmetric distances from the margin. Tension is applied to bring the suture across the wound, and loops are formed in preparation for tying. The subsequent sequence is devoted to securing and trimming what has just been placed: there are no new passes in this brief period, only tightening of the knot and cutting the tails close to the knot stack. Through these actions, the wound edges remain nicely approximated without gapping.

Advancing inferiorly with precise bite placement (105–134 s)
After finishing the previous knot, the operator drops inferior to place the next stitch along the same slit. The driver, still in the left hand, loads the curved needle on its proximal third, perpendicular to the surface, and passes left-to-right with controlled wrist rotation. The right-hand forceps aid with both eversion and retrieval, allowing a smooth needle exit and regrasp to complete the arc. By the end of this run, a new interrupted stitch has been fully passed and then tied using instrument throws. The hands remain close and symmetric around the wound, the driver often holding the post (standing limb) while the assisting instrument guides the free end through the loops and tensions the knot down over the incision. As before, the knot rests slightly left of the wound line.

Refining knots and preparing for continued placement (135–164 s)
Attention shifts briefly to the leftmost end near one of the upper stitches, where the newly passed stitch is tied down with alternating throws, seated neatly on the left side. The operator prepares the tails for trimming, then brings in scissors to cut them close to the knot. Once trimming is done, both hands momentarily leave the field. Shortly after, the right hand reenters with a needle driver carrying a newly loaded needle-suture. The curve is oriented toward the same small vertical incision, confirming continued work along the same wound rather than elsewhere on the pad.

Adding and finishing at the superior end (165–209 s)
The next sequences focus on completing the top portion of the closure. The left hand holds the driver positioned just left and slightly superior to the wound; the right hand alternates between Adson-type forceps and scissors. The needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip and remains perpendicular to the skin for another precise pass. The forceps help evert each edge and control the needle tip as it emerges. After passage, the suture is drawn through and slack removed, and the instrument tie begins. The knot is again seated on the left side of the slit. In the following frames, the operator tightens previously placed stitches without taking new bites, parking the needle superior to the wound while tensioning and setting the knot. Scissors then trim the tails, leaving a neat knot stack with short ends aligned left of the incision. Throughout, the orientation of hands and instruments is steady: the driver is generally superior-lateral, the assistant instrument works just medial to the incision, and movements are kept close to the wound to maintain control.

Progressing to the lower end of the slit (210–239 s)
With the superior portion secured, the operator moves down the incision to work at the inferior end. The right hand now holds the needle driver, while the left hand alternates with forceps to present the wound edges. The needle is grasped about one-third from the swage and passed with smooth wrist rotation; the forceps lift and evert the lower wound edges to present balanced, symmetric bite points. Following passage, the stitch is tightened and then tied using an instrument tie at the most distal part of the slit. The driver remains superior/left of the bite while the assisting hand guides the free limb, forming loops and cinching the throws down squarely at the wound surface. No new bites are taken during the tying sequence; the focus is on securing this distal stitch.

Tightening, trimming, and instrument organization (240–254 s)
The lower stitch is snugged down, its tension adjusted so the edges are approximated without undue compression. Scissors briefly enter to trim the tails, while the driver maintains control over the suture near the knot to prevent loosening. The instruments work in parallel around the incision, with the driver on the operator’s left and the scissors crossing from the right as needed. The silicone skin shows consistent eversion and gentle puckering beneath the knot stacks—a typical appearance when simple interrupted stitches are tied to appropriate tension.

Brief static intervals showing progress and suture management (255–284 s)
The next moments provide a stable view of the closure without active manipulation. The short vertical slit in the upper-left quadrant now displays a short run of evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches progressing from superior to inferior. Knots and tails lie to the left of the incision, the edges are approximated, and the spacing appears regular with modest, uniform tension. Multiple small hemostats have been clipped to the suture tails of the top stitches, extending superolaterally. This deliberate management keeps tails organized and prevents tangling while the operator addresses the remaining gap toward the inferior end. A needle holder or forceps lies horizontally to the left of the incision, idle and not held by either hand. No new stitches are placed during this pause.

Preparation for the next stitch and intermittent idle frames (285–299 s)
The field remains concentrated around the same small vertical wound. A free needle and suture lie across the lower part of the incision, indicating readiness to place the next stitch. Briefly, a gloved hand and instrument pass across the right side of the field but do not engage the wound during these frames. Most of the time, the needle is not actively held; it rests on the pad with its strand draped over the target area. The superior two-thirds of the cut are already closed with neatly arranged interrupted stitches; the inferior portion remains the most open segment, consistent with the plan to continue moving downward.

Final overview of the closure (300–301 s)
The closing view confirms the work remains centered on the same short vertical incision in the upper-left quadrant. Multiple interrupted sutures have been placed along its length, their knots and clipped or trimmed tails all directed to the left of the incision. The wound edges show mild eversion and gentle compression where the knots sit, and the spacing between stitches is even, with only small gaps visible between bites. Other incisions on the pad—central vertical and lateral slits—remain unmanipulated and open throughout the case, underscoring that attention and intervention have been confined to this single upper-left wound.

Technique and hand dynamics throughout
From start to finish, the operator adheres to a simple interrupted technique. The needle is consistently grasped on the proximal-to-middle third of its curve, oriented perpendicular to the pad surface for reliable dermal purchase. Forceps are used thoughtfully to evert and stabilize the edges at each bite, with the grasp taken a few millimeters from the margin to minimize crush and maximize precision. Passes are executed with controlled wrist rotation, and the needle is often regripped mid-arc to maintain optimal angle and prevent tissue drag. After each pass, slack is removed smoothly; the assistant hand manages the free limb to clear the field and prevent entanglement with adjacent stitches.

Instrument ties are the predominant knotting method. Early on, both hands employ needle holders to control the short tail and long limb, respectively, forming square throws that are seated directly over the wound. Later intervals show the driver parked on the standing limb (post) while the assisting instrument guides the free limb through the loops, ensuring the knot lies slightly to the left side, in line with the rest of the series. Tails are trimmed close with scissors introduced from the left or right as visibility permits, always with the driver stabilizing the knot to avoid loosening. At several points, the needle remains secured in the driver while knots are tightened and tails cut, preventing free needles from wandering in the field.

Spatial relationships are consistent: the needle driver most often operates just left of the incision, while forceps work from the right, instruments straddling the slit and converging over the gap only during passage or retrieval. Occasional role reversals—such as when the right hand takes the driver for passes near the inferior end—are dictated by ergonomics and approach angle rather than a change in target. During pauses, especially when multiple stitches have accumulated superiorly, the suture tails are organized with small hemostats to the superolateral side, and idle instruments are laid out left of the incision to keep the working field clear.

Tissue handling and closure quality
Across the sequence, tissue handling remains gentle and controlled. Each stitch is taken with symmetric entry and exit points, and the edges are everted with light forceps pressure rather than crushed. The resulting approximation shows mild, uniform puckering under the knot stacks—expected for properly tensioned simple interrupted closures on a synthetic pad. Knot placement consistently sits to the left of the incision line, creating a tidy lateral knot row. When tying, the operator avoids over-tightening, maintaining perfusion and preventing blanching or tearing of the silicone skin.

Continuity and focus on a single wound
Despite a brief segment in which the wound appears transverse during a tying sequence, every other detail—location in the upper-left quadrant, presence of neighboring untouched slits, instrument approach angles, and the persistent left-sided knot orientation—demonstrates uninterrupted focus on the same small vertical incision. No suturing is performed on the central or right-side slits at any time. The line builds from the superior end downward, with periodic pauses to trim and organize, then resumes with additional passes and ties toward the inferior end.

Final state
By the end of the recording, the short vertical incision in the upper-left quadrant is closed with a line of simple interrupted stitches. Knots and tails are consistently positioned to the left, spacing is regular, and edge apposition is even with slight eversion. Superior segments are fully secured; the inferior portion has been addressed with additional stitches and tying sequences, and the field shows no active manipulation. Instruments and hands are largely off-screen in the final moments, leaving a clear view of a neat, well-organized interrupted closure that maintains alignment along the entire length of the small wound while leaving other nearby incisions undisturbed.
