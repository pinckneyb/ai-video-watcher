COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure documents a focused, stepwise closure of a single linear skin defect on the practice pad. From the first frames through the end of the recording the operator uses a two‑handed technique—one instrument (a needle driver/hemostat) to control a curved suture needle and the other (fine toothed or flat tissue forceps/Adson pickup) to present, evert and steady skin edges—placing sequential interrupted skin sutures along the length of the same cut. The working wound is the vertical linear incision on the right‑central/mid‑right portion of the pad; other completed suture rows visible elsewhere on the pad serve as visual guides and are not the focus of the work.

Setup and initial passes
At the start the operator positions both gloved hands close to the incision, creating a tight working envelope of typically a few centimetres between instrument tips. The dominant needle‑controlling hand holds a needle driver, while the non‑dominant hand uses fine tissue forceps to grasp the near wound edge. The curved cutting/skin needle is consistently grasped in the driver at or near the mid‑shaft to distal third (sometimes mentioned as mid‑curve or close to the tip), enabling controlled rotation through its arc. The driver is repeatedly oriented roughly perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin so each bite traverses epidermis and superficial dermis in a short arc from one margin to the other.

The tissue forceps elevate and evert the edge to present dermis for purchase. Bites are shallow—limited to epidermal/dermal layers appropriate to simple interrupted skin closure on the simulator—avoiding excessive traction or deep tissue engagement. The operator rotates the needle through the tissue by turning the wrist and driver, then the opposite instrument (forceps or the driver itself) retrieves the needle tip on the far side. From the outset the operator maintains consistent spacing and placement adjacent to previously placed interrupted sutures on the same line, using the already‑closed rows on the pad as spacing references.

Sequential interrupted technique and maintained spacing
Throughout the case the same pattern repeats: present and evert with forceps, insert the curved needle with the driver from one edge to the other in a controlled arc, withdraw and retrieve the needle with the opposing instrument, pull the suture through, and prepare for knotting. Multiple frame groups show that the operator places stitches sequentially along the wound—moving from one end of the defect to the other and placing each simple interrupted stitch adjacent to the previous ones. Spacing is generally regular (on the order of a few millimetres, comparable to the nearby completed rows), and each bite targets the dermal margin to achieve edge apposition with slight eversion.

Needle handling remains consistent: the grip is firm but not at the swage or extreme tip; the driver repositions between passes, sometimes advancing the grasp a little to rotate the needle more effectively or to facilitate retrieval. The needle arc is controlled, predictable and repeated—perpendicular entry then rotation across the dermis—ensuring that the suture crosses balanced tissue and produces surface apposition rather than inversion.

Eversion and tissue handling
A recurring emphasis is eversion of wound edges. The assistant hand (forceps) lifts and tent‑presents the near margin so the needle enters into well‑presented dermis, and after passage the operator brings the two margins together with proper orientation. Tissue handling is consistently atraumatic for a simulation setting: light traction with forceps, no gross crushing, and only superficial bites. The operator intermittently adjusts and realigns the skin between passes to maintain even tension and to preserve a slightly everted skin edge at each stitch, which improves epidermal contact once knots are completed.

Hand positions and instrument orientation over time
Hand and instrument positions evolve modestly but predictably as the work progresses along the incision. Early frames show the needle driver approaching from above/left or cranial aspects while forceps approach from right or caudal directions; instruments often cross over the wound in a triangulated pattern that concentrates instrument tips 1–4 cm above the defect. As successive stitches are placed, the operator shifts hand position incrementally along the wound axis so the driver continues to approach the current bite from a comfortable and mechanically favourable angle (often from a superior or medial position) while the forceps move to the opposite lateral or inferior side to counter‑present the tissue. In many frames the driver is the proximal, more mobile instrument and the forceps the stabilizer; on occasion the roles reverse briefly to facilitate needle retrieval.

Where the wound orientation or local access changes slightly (for instance, when the operator works closer to the superior or inferior end of the incision), the driver orients more obliquely rather than strictly perpendicular, but the core mechanics remain the same: midshaft needle grasp, controlled arc, forceps presentation, and retrieval. A few frames show occasional use of scissors, hemostats, or a flat metal instrument to cut tails or stabilize suture material prior to knotting; these adjuncts are used transiently and are not the primary means of tissue manipulation.

Knot management and mid‑procedure adjustments
Between bites the operator ties and secures interrupted knots—frames capture short tied segments and manipulated tails—then trims and adjusts as necessary. There are also timepoints where motions are more consistent with adjusting or tensioning previously placed sutures (repositioning knots, trimming tails) rather than placing new transcutaneous bites. These steps are interleaved with new passes and represent completion of earlier stitches as the line progresses. The operator’s technique in knot formation is efficient and consistent with interrupted closure: after pulling the suture through and bringing edges into apposition, the operator uses the two instruments to create secure throws and tighten without over‑compressing tissue, maintaining slight eversion.

Mid‑procedure, the operator repositions the needle driver grip as needed to control more acute angles or to ease retrieval; forceps may be swapped between toothed and flat pickups depending on whether the operator is holding tissue or manipulating suture tails. Small variabilities—such as temporary instrument exchanges, brief use of scissors, or different approach vectors—appear but do not change the fundamental interrupted technique.

Continuity of the stitch row and references to other lines
Throughout the recording the operator consistently returns to the same right‑central vertical incision, extending the row stitch by stitch. Other sutured lines on the pad—left‑side rows or central horizontal scars—appear repeatedly in the field as reference markers for spacing and alignment. These already‑closed rows are untouched except for occasional tensioning or trimming actions; they function as visual templates to ensure uniform spacing and consistent bite depth. On a few frames, actions near alternate incisions could be misread as a shift in focus, but instrument behaviour, suture tails and the majority of needle passes indicate the operator continues to drive and complete stitches along the same right‑central vertical cut.

Technique consistency and refinement
The fundamental technique—simple interrupted skin sutures placed through epidermis and superficial dermis with the needle driver gripping mid‑shaft and forceps presenting and everting tissue—remains consistent from first to last stitch. Over the course of the procedure the operator refines small elements: improved economy of motion when rotating the needle, slightly quicker needle transfers between instruments, and more uniform knot tensioning as the row progresses. These refinements produce increasingly even eversion and better edge approximation with each subsequent stitch. The operator remains mindful of tissue handling, avoiding excessive tension and preventing inversion.

Spatial relationships and coordinated bimanual work
Hands remain coordinated in a narrow working zone. The needle driver typically approaches from a superior or medial position relative to the incision while the forceps approach from a lateral or inferior direction, though these vectors vary slightly depending on the bite position. Instruments converge directly above the intended entry point; the operator times driver passes and forceps presentation closely to minimize tissue displacement and to maintain control of the needle tip at all times. When the driver is used to retrieve the needle, the forceps often hand off the suture tail so the operator can form knots without losing control of the line.

Occasional frames show the hands slightly farther apart—during knot‑tying or trimming steps—then the operator re‑establishes the close bimanual triangulation for the next needle pass. Near the end of the session the operator’s hands withdraw progressively farther from the wound while finishing knots and managing suture tails.

Final inspection and completion
In the last segments the operator completes the remaining interrupted stitches along the right‑side incision, secures and trims suture tails, and performs a brief inspection of the line. The closure exhibits uniform spacing and consistent slight eversion of the epidermal edges with no visible gaping. Tissue handling throughout has been atraumatic on the simulated pad—no gross tearing or crush injury is evident. After final adjustments the operator withdraws instruments and briefly covers the pad with a card, indicating the suturing segment is finished.

Noted deviations and observational caveats
Throughout the recording there are brief intervals where activity appears focused on knot adjustment or suture management rather than new passes; a few frame groups describe motions on left‑side regions or trimming along adjacent rows. Those moments represent completion and refinement activities or momentary referencing of nearby completed lines rather than wholesale transfer of focus—the technique and needle passes persist on the same right‑central vertical incision. A final frame sequence shows hands withdrawing and covering the pad, which corroborates completion.

Overall impression
The operator executes a disciplined, methodical series of interrupted skin sutures along a single right‑central vertical incision. Technique is consistent: midshaft needle grasp, perpendicular-to‑oblique needle entry, forceps‑assisted eversion and approximation, secure interrupted knot formation, and measured trimming/adjustment. Hand positions remain bimanually coordinated in a narrow working envelope, gradually shifting along the wound axis as the row progresses. By the end the wound is uniformly approximated with properly oriented skin edges and well‑tensioned interrupted knots, and the operator completes the sequence by trimming and withdrawing instruments, leaving a cleanly closed line appropriate for primary skin closure on the simulated pad.
