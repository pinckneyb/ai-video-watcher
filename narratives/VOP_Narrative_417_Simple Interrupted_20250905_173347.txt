COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a synthetic skin pad with multiple linear slits. The right hand, in a green glove, brings in a needle driver and fine forceps to set up the first stitch. The left hand parks a ringed needle driver vertically along the left edge of the pad to serve as a stabilizing post. After a brief reload to refine the angle, the curved needle is oriented perpendicular to the pad. An initial anchoring pass is placed through the lower-left pad margin, creating a fixed reference point to control the suture. With the field organized and the suture kept clear of the working site, the right hand brings the needle toward the left edge of the lower central (inferior midline) incision.

As the sequence progresses, the needle has already traversed the inferior midline slit. The right hand draws the needle and suture through and parks the needle safely out of the central field. The left hand now centers a needle driver over the wound, and instrument ties begin. The driver acts as the post while the right hand manages the free tail. Loops are formed and the short end is passed through, then the strands are pulled in opposite directions across the wound axis to snug the throw.

Knot construction continues with a steady rhythm. The driver reaches across the wound from the superior-left to grasp the short end, then alternating tension seats square throws directly onto the epidermal surface. The movements are compact, with tension applied horizontally across the incision to avoid gapping. The knot settles slightly left-inferior to the wound center as the driver is withdrawn and the needle remains parked to the right for safety.

The pace shifts to a new cycle. The right hand re-grasps the needle with a gold-handled driver at the mid-body and reorients it to a true 90-degree approach for the small vertical slit on the lower-left. A second instrument from the left stabilizes the near edge with minimal lift. The right hand rotates the needle smoothly through its arc, releases and re-grasps to complete the pull-through, and draws the suture across to set up for tying.

Immediately, the operator transitions into instrument ties over this new stitch. The left-hand driver becomes the post positioned just superior-left of the incision while the right hand controls the free end. Throws are alternated to square the knot, with both hands pulling in opposite directions to seat each throw flush. The suture line straightens across the pad, the driver is briefly parked along the left edge while the right hand maintains tension, and additional throws are added to secure the repair.

The next passage targets a precise corner region on the lower-left wound. The right hand switches to tissue forceps, pencil grip, to present and evert the dermal edge for a controlled entry. The left hand holds the needle driver steady with the needle clamped two-thirds from the tip and aligned perpendicular. The needle passes while remaining secured in the driver; the right hand draws the suture through, keeping the needle under control and out of harm’s way. With the bite placed, the operator returns to instrument tying, keeping tension parallel to the wound to avoid gapping.

As these throws are seated, the needle is parked in the driver while the right hand manages the free end. Once the knot is secure, scissors are introduced and the tails are trimmed close to the knot—one of the few moments in the sequence when cutting is shown—cleanly completing this interrupted stitch. The field briefly clears, revealing a line of well-spaced interrupted sutures along the left laceration.

Attention then moves to the more superior portion of the left vertical laceration, which already bears several interrupted stitches. The right hand uses forceps to organize the suture and the needle driver to regrasp the needle on its body at an appropriate position, reorienting it to a perpendicular approach and removing slack. No new bite is taken in this preparatory phase; instead, the operator tidies the setup for the next maneuver and confirms alignment over the wound.

Rather than driving the needle immediately, the next frames show instrument tying on a recently placed stitch along the left-middle incision. The right hand controls the long limb while the left-hand driver alternates across the wound, looping, grasping the short tail, and sliding successive throws down. The tension alternates left and right, producing true square throws that sit neatly on the wound margin without crushing tissue. The left hand maintains consistent counter-traction throughout as the right hand advances and seats each throw.

Additional throws are added in the same measured cadence. Loops are thrown clockwise over the driver, the short end is captured, and the knot is snugged with opposing vectors to keep it centered and flat. The needle itself is left safely outside the immediate tying area, and the edges remain approximated by suture tension alone, with no forceps eversion maneuvers at this stage. Tails are not cut in this sequence.

In the final moments, the left hand briefly reenters with forceps to provide light traction adjacent to the suture line while the right hand manages the strand, likely checking lay and tension. Both instruments then withdraw, leaving a clear field that shows the completed interrupted stitches along the left laceration, with other training slits untouched.

Across the video, the flow settles into a consistent pass–tie rhythm: controlled needle loading and perpendicular entries when taking bites; the needle parked safely away during ties; instrument ties built with alternating throws and opposing tension; and knots seated directly on the epidermal surface without tissue trauma. Hand roles remain disciplined—the left-hand driver often acting as a post and stabilizer, the right hand executing passes, gathering slack, and advancing throws. The result is a calm, methodical sequence that progresses from an initial anchor and first stitch on the inferior midline slit to additional simple interrupted stitches on the lower-left and left-middle incisions, with clean knot stacks and well-approximated wound edges.
