COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
At the start of the recording the operator focuses on the left-side defect of the practice skin pad — a short linear/oblique incision in the upper-left quadrant of the model that is repeatedly approached and closed throughout the session. From the opening frames onward the surgical work consistently proceeds along that same left-sided incision, with earlier and later stitches visible as a contiguous row along the wound margin as the operator advances toward the remaining open segment. The pad is a synthetic dermal model; bites are taken through the simulated epidermal/dermal layer with the operator using standard two‑instrument technique — a needle driver to manipulate a curved suture needle and toothed/fine tissue forceps to control tissue and suture tails.

Initial approach and needle handling
The first passes show a curved surgical needle secured in the needle driver approximately at the mid‑to‑distal shaft in most frames. The driver is frequently held in a vertical-to-oblique orientation over the incision, the needle tip directed down toward the tissue and advanced in a smooth arc. The non‑needle instrument (toothed or fine thumb forceps) is used to lift and tent one wound edge, creating counter‑traction and slight eversion to present the dermis for purchase. The operator’s hands remain close to the wound surface — typically within a few centimeters of one another — allowing precise control of bite depth and needle trajectory.

Needle purchases are deliberate and controlled. In many frames the operator grasps the needle near the shaft rather than at the swage or tip, which permits rotation of the needle through the tissue in an arc that approximates common simple interrupted technique. Depending on the frame, the needle driver approaches from above, superior/medial, or from a lateral aspect relative to the incision, but the pattern of passing the needle from one wound margin to the other while the opposing forceps provides counter‑traction remains constant. Bites vary from superficial-to-middermal in some passes to full‑thickness simulated dermal bites in others; across the sequence the operator consistently aims to evert the edges slightly so that epidermal apposition will be precise once the suture is tensioned.

Sequencing along the incision
From the earliest to the latest timestamps the operator works sequentially along the left incision, placing one interrupted stitch after another adjacent to the previously placed sutures. Several completed interrupted stitches appear distally at the start, and the operator advances along the gap, addressing the unapproximated segment incrementally. Each stitch follows the same cycle: position the forceps to lift/evert one margin and control the suture tail; position the needle driver, rotate the curved needle through the first margin, draw the needle across the trough of the wound, and then retrieve/guide it through the opposite margin. The suture strand is pulled through and managed beneath the forceps while the driver is repositioned for knot forming or subsequent passage.

Throughout this progression the operator repeatedly returns the needle driver overhead of the working area, with the forceps held opposite to stabilize tissue and manage the suture tail. Spatially, the instrument tips converge consistently at or just above the wound edge, separated by a narrow working distance — typically in the order of 1–4 cm — to allow transfer of the needle and control of bite depth. Where the incision geometry curves or the working segment shifts cephalad, the operator adjusts hand approach angles so that needle trajectory remains perpendicular-to-oblique relative to the skin surface, preserving consistent purchase.

Technique details and evolution
The overall technique is the simple interrupted pattern. From the outset the operator demonstrates a methodical rhythm: lift and evert / pass needle / draw suture / prepare for knot‑tying. Needle grips are most often placed at the body or mid‑shaft of the curved needle to exploit the curvature for controlled tissue penetration. The arc of passage is conservative, minimizing undue tissue trauma on the synthetic pad by avoiding overly large bites. In many passes the bites are limited to dermal-subcutaneous depth of the simulator to bring epidermal lips into apposition with slight eversion.

As the session proceeds the operator’s technique refines subtle elements of suture management. Early passes emphasize clean, even bites with modest tension; later passes show more confident manipulation of the suture tail under the opposing forceps and more deliberate instrument tying or hand-assisted knot formation. At intervals scissors are introduced briefly to trim tails after knot tying, indicating progression from mere placement to completion of individual interrupted stitches. In mid‑session frames there are explicit sequences showing knot tightening and then tail trimming adjacent to recently placed stitches, confirming the operator’s closure plan of placing and securing each interrupted stitch before moving on.

Hand positioning and handedness
Although small variations occur in which hand functions as the needle driver versus tissue forceps, the functional relationship between hands remains stable. Most frames show the needle driver held in the operator’s dominant hand (either right or left depending on frame annotation) working from an overhead or superior angle; the opposing hand holds forceps below, lateral, or medial and provides counter‑traction and suture control. The driver typically approaches the wound from above/medial while the forceps approach from below/lateral, but these approach vectors rotate around the incision as needed to follow the curvature of the wound.

Throughout the procedure the tips of the two instruments remain closely apposed to the wound margins to allow the needle to pass smoothly between them. During needle passage the forceps tip often elevates the near edge and temporarily shelters the suture tail beneath the driver, keeping the suture oriented to facilitate a tidy knot later. As the operator moves along the defect, hand positions shift incrementally in concert with the working site: when the operator proceeds cranially the driver may be more cephalad and lateral while the forceps slide medially and inferiorly to maintain optimal needle approach.

Spatial relationships and coordination
Coordination between the two instruments is attentive and repetitive. The needle driver consistently occupies the superior or lateral position relative to the wound while the forceps provides inferior or medial stabilization and suture management. The relationship is intimate: instrument tips are frequently only a couple of centimeters apart, minimizing unnecessary twisting of the needle and reducing torque on the simulated tissue. The operator rotates the needle through tissue in a controlled arc, retrieves the tip with opposing forceps on the far side, and withdraws the suture through the tunnel created by the needle. This mated action repeats with little deviation frame‑to‑frame, demonstrating procedural consistency.

Tissue handling and wound apposition
Tissue manipulation is careful and atraumatic for the synthetic substrate. The forceps elevate and evert the wound edge, producing a mild ridge so that when the suture is tied the epidermal margins come into even apposition with gentle outward orientation. Tension on the suture is maintained at a moderate level so that the edges meet without inversion or puckering. At times the operator slightly mobilizes adjacent skin flaps, especially where the incision is undermined or a small lateral gap remains; these manipulations are subtle and focused on aligning the epidermal edges rather than performing deep fascial closure.

Variations and minor inconsistencies
The overwhelming pattern is of a single continuous repair along the left-side incision, but a few frames contain ambiguous or discordant observations that suggest alternative working regions in the pad. For example, some timestamps include descriptions of a vertical incision on the right side of the pad being tightened and trimmed; elsewhere frames note suturing at a more central vertical incision. These inconsistencies likely reflect either brief camera framing differences or misattributed frame labels rather than an actual change in the operator’s target — the visible progression of stitches and the consistent presence of earlier sutures adjacent to the left-sided defect indicate the operator’s primary focus remains the left-side line. Where bites are described as full‑thickness in some frames and superficial-to-middermal in others, this appears to reflect intentional variation to accommodate the simulated tissue thickness and to ensure epidermal edge apposition; the working goal — aligned, mildly everted epidermal edges secured by interrupted knots — is preserved.

Knot formation, trimming and finishing
Once the needle is drawn through both margins and the suture tail managed, the operator prepares to secure each interrupted stitch. Several frames explicitly show knot tightening maneuvers with the needle driver and forceps, followed in later frames by the introduction of small scissors to trim suture tails. Knot-tying appears to be performed by instrument ties rather than by hand knots alone; the suture material is tensioned, the knot is formed with the driver and forceps, and tails are shortened to tidy the closure. In some sequences the operator positions a small clamp or scissors adjacent to the knot to facilitate safe trimming of the tail close to the knot, thereby leaving a neat line of interrupted stitches.

Final configuration and wound closure
By the later timestamped frames the previously open segment has been bridged with a contiguous line of interrupted sutures extending along the former gap. The wound edges are approximated with consistent mild eversion and minimal residual gaping. Suture tails have been trimmed at intervals, and the completed row presents as a stable, evenly spaced series of interrupted knots. The simulated tissue appears aligned and tension distributed across multiple interrupted points rather than concentrated at a single locus, indicating sound mechanical closure practice.

Summary appraisal
Over the entire recording the operator employs a consistent, methodical interrupted-suture technique to close the left-sided incision on the synthetic skin pad. Needle handling is deliberate — the curved needle is gripped near mid‑shaft and driven in a controlled arc while opposing forceps tent and evert the tissue. Hands remain close to the wound throughout, with the needle driver typically above or lateral to the incision and the forceps counter‑trajecting below or opposite. Sutures are placed sequentially adjacent to the existing row, each stitch being pulled through, secured with instrument-assisted knots, and trimmed. Minor frame-to-frame variations in bite depth (superficial-to-middermal vs. full-thickness) and occasional ambiguous frame descriptions do not alter the coherent progression of closure along this single left-side wound. In the end the incision is uniformly approximated by a neat line of interrupted stitches with even tension, slight eversion of the epidermal edges, and trimmed suture tails — a controlled, complete interrupted closure of the defect.
