COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a pink synthetic skin pad mounted to a wooden board. From the outset it’s clear that the surgeon’s attention centers on the small vertical slit in the middle of the pad—a short, straight midline incision flanked by two longer parallel cuts that serve as landmarks but are not part of the ongoing closure. At the very beginning, a paper card labeled “216” temporarily covers the pad’s center, obscuring the wound and leaving only idle instruments visible to the left. No tissue manipulation occurs during this brief preparatory moment; a gloved right hand momentarily moves loose suture across the upper field, then withdraws.

Once the field is cleared, work begins at the central incision. The left hand takes the needle driver and the right hand brings in Adson forceps. The first passes are classic full-thickness bites on either side of the central slit with the curved needle loaded about two-thirds from the tip so the needle’s arc can be followed naturally. The right-hand forceps present and slightly evert the wound edge as the left-hand driver advances the needle perpendicular to the skin surface. The needle enters the left dermal margin and exits symmetrically on the right, a few millimeters from the edge and at a matched depth. After the far-side exit, the driver regrips the needle and draws the suture through. With the first pass in, the forceps set down, and the driver and right hand work together to tie an instrument knot directly over the center of the incision. The driver functions as a post; the right hand wraps and alternates throws to lay the knot squarely. The approximation is snug without blanching, and the edges show slight eversion. In these early segments, the operator repeats this pattern—placing a stitch and then performing instrument ties—so the wound begins to coapt at midline. On a few of these early passes, the camera angle or pad orientation makes the same midline slit appear horizontal; despite the change in visual orientation, the technique and target line are consistent, with the driver poised above the wound and the right hand alternating between forceps work and suture management to maintain a straight, even closure.

During this introductory phase, the operator briefly looks toward the left vertical slit, positioning the needle driver for a potential bite there and even initiating an approach with the forceps to evert that edge. However, this diversion is not pursued into a separate closure; the effort quickly returns to the same central wound, where the sequence of pass-and-tie continues. This momentary excursion does not change the operative plan, and no sustained suturing occurs on the lateral incisions. Throughout, the spacing and depth of the bites on the central slit remain consistent, and the knot stacks lie centered over the wound line.

As the central closure proceeds, the surgeon demonstrates well-controlled hand choreography. The left hand is the primary driver, grasping the curved needle at its proximal third to middle so the tip is free to lead. Entry is taken perpendicular to the skin edge, and a smooth wrist rotation carries the needle’s curve through the dermis. The right hand, using forceps, gently lifts the near edge to establish slight eversion, then transitions to the far edge to guide the needle out without crushing the tissue. Once the needle exits, the right hand releases tissue, manages the free strand to avoid slack, and helps lay each knot squarely. Instrument ties dominate these early closures: the long strand is wrapped around the driver, the opposite strand is grasped, and alternating throws are seated with even, opposing tension across the incision. After each knot is seated flush, scissors enter briefly to trim tails on at least one of the stitches, demonstrating basic suture housekeeping before the next pass is undertaken.

With several stitches now holding the central incision in good approximation at its mid-portion, work advances superiorly along the same line. The wound edges remain clean and linear, and the marks flanking the wound serve as reference points that help maintain symmetric bite spacing and depth. The left-hand driver positions just superior-left to the planned entry point; the right-hand forceps hover over the right edge, ready to present tissue. A fresh bite is taken: the curved needle engages the left dermal margin at a measured distance from the edge and arcs through to the right where the forceps stabilize the dermis for exit. The strand is pulled through, and the line remains taut without strangulation. In some sequences at this stage, instead of immediately tying, the operator draws the suture through and advances, suggesting a transition from isolated interrupted knots to a continuous progression along the same central incision.

That evolution becomes increasingly clear as the procedure migrates into the upper half of the wound. The string of approximating stitches through the central portion forms the anchor of the closure; superior to these, the surgeon begins to run the line, taking sequential, evenly spaced bites without stopping to tie after each pass. The left hand repositions the needle in the driver so the curvature is maintained, and the tip meets the skin at a true perpendicular to avoid skiving. Each pass mirrors the last: entry on one side, a smooth arc across, and emergence on the opposite edge under forceps control. The right hand modulates strand tension between passes, maintaining a gentle line that holds prior edges together while preserving working space at the leading edge of the closure. This creates the classic working triangle: the driver at the advancing apex of the wound, the right hand holding the suture limb slightly lateral to the wound, and the wound line forming the base. Visibility is excellent, and the instruments never crowd the tissue.

As the running sequence gains length, the surgeon pauses intermittently to snug the most recent turn, keeping the edges aligned without buckling or inversion. When forceps are used, they only lightly pinch the epidermal/dermal margins to present tissue, avoiding crush injury. The bites remain small and symmetric, with consistent spacing from the cut edge, preserving dermal apposition and a slight, desirable eversion. The suture path advances steadily toward the superior apex of the central incision, with the driver typically just left of midline and the right-hand forceps or fingers stationed to the right, ready to receive the needle or control the strand.

At the superior third of the incision, the surgeon prepares to secure the running line. The needle remains clamped in the driver, but during tying it is often “parked,” with the driver functioning primarily as the tying instrument. The right hand releases the forceps and uses the free limb to create loops around the driver’s tip. The driver exchanges the strands and cinches the throw down precisely at the apex. This terminal sequence emphasizes control over loop formation and seating: loops are formed in alternating directions, the driver grasps the opposing strand, and each throw is snugged with controlled, lateral-to-medial pulls that set the knot vertically over the wound line without twisting. The wound edges at the apex are stable and well approximated by the preceding continuous passes; no new penetration is taken during these tying-only frames, and the emphasis is on securing the line rather than advancing it.

In some segments, the operator revisits a recently placed stitch in the central portion to square a knot or to trim residual tails. When scissors are used, they approach parallel to the incision, with the tips oriented to cut the tail cleanly while protecting the skin. These housekeeping steps are brief and precise, after which the focus immediately returns to advancing or locking the superior end of the same midline closure.

The technical consistency throughout the run is notable. The needle is consistently held at its proximal third to middle, preserving a stable working length and giving the driver adequate control for wrist-driven, curvilinear passage. Entries are perpendicular, minimizing the risk of crescent-shaped, oblique tracks. The right-hand forceps never “chase” the needle; instead, they are positioned ahead of the needle to elevate the dermal edge and receive its tip as it emerges. When the surgeon needs to regrasp, the driver releases and reacquires the needle at an appropriate point on the curve to maintain orientation. Strand management is tidy: slack is minimized, and the free limb is kept lateral and superior to maintain a clear operative window.

As the final pass of the running sequence is completed at the superior apex, the closure proceeds through its terminal tying sequence. The driver—typically just left of the apex—becomes the post around which the right-hand strand is wrapped. Multiple throws are laid in alternating directions to produce a secure, flat knot. The suture is tightened directly over the apex, with both hands converging and then diverging in coordinated motions that set each throw without lifting or shearing the approximated edges. During these frames, the needle remains in the driver but away from tissue, functioning as a handle. Once a secure sequence of throws is established, scissors enter briefly to trim the tail to an appropriate length, leaving a neat, compact knot stack at the apex.

After locking the terminal knot, the surgeon inspects the entire vertical line. From the previously placed stitches in the mid-portion to the newer, running segment at the top, the edges are well aligned with slight, uniform eversion. The spacing between bites is even; the depth appears consistent; and there is no visible gapping. Any earlier knots placed in the central portion sit flush on the skin, anchoring the line without bulges or dog-ears. The lateral incisions remain untouched and open, consistent with their role as bystanders throughout. The overall effect is a straight, continuous closure along the midline, with a terminal knot anchored at the superior end.

During the very end of the recording, the field quiets. The driver and forceps withdraw. In one late still, the card labeled “216” again obscures the central pad, and no instruments contact the tissue. A few loose strands of suture are visible below the pad on the board, suggesting the procedure has concluded and extra material has been set aside. No further passes or manipulations occur.

Across the entire sequence, the hand positions evolve naturally with the demands of each step. During passes, the left hand holds the needle driver just left of midline, applying smooth wrist arcs to follow the needle’s curvature, while the right hand, usually with Adson forceps, stabilizes and everts tissue at the right edge. During instrument ties, forceps are often set down; the right hand grips the free suture limb and wraps around the driver, which acts as the post, and the left hand shuttles the suture to pick up and snug the opposing strand. Tension is applied in alternating directions to lay down square, secure knots. When trimming is necessary, scissors approach parallel to the incision; both hands coordinate to avoid lifting the suture off the skin. This bimanual choreography creates a consistent working triangle over the wound, maintains visualization of entry and exit points, and protects the newly approximated edges from inadvertent shear.

There are a few moments where visualization is hindered or activity diverges briefly from the main line. Early on, the “216” card obscures the wound, preventing visualization of any stitch placement in those frames. Later, the left lateral slit is briefly approached as if for a bite, but no sustained suturing occurs there, and the very next sequences resume closure on the central incision. At one point, the same central slit appears horizontal relative to the field—a likely change in camera or pad orientation rather than a change in the target wound—because the instrument relationships and technique remain identical. These minor visual or positional shifts do not alter the continuous narrative of closing the central midline incision.

Technically, the closure demonstrates careful tissue handling and consistency. Bites are taken near the cuticular-dermal junction with symmetric width and depth, avoiding excessive margin distance or deep undermining that might invert or crush tissue. Eversion is achieved with minimal force, typically through gentle elevation with Adsons at the far edge and careful needle trajectory on the near side. The surgeon maintains short instrument travel and avoids sweeping motions that would obscure the field. During running sequences, prior stitches are respected as an anchor; tension is distributed across the line rather than concentrated at a single point, preventing strangulation or step-offs. Knot tying—both for early interrupted stitches and later for the terminal knot of the running segment—follows a disciplined, alternating-throw pattern with precise loop formation and careful seating directly over the incision line.

By the end, the central vertical wound is completely approximated from inferior to superior with a tidy sequence of stitches culminating in a secured apex. The suture line is straight, the edges are coapted with mild eversion, and the final knot is compact and well seated. Instruments and hands have left the field, leaving a clean, completed closure at the precise site where all work throughout the procedure has been directed.
