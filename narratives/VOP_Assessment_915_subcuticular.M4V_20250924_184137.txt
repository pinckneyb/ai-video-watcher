COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a multi-incision silicone skin pad with several parallel vertical slits. One of these wounds—the vertical line on the left side of the pad—is chosen for a continuous running skin closure, and everything that meaningfully advances the repair occurs along this single line. Several brief interludes show the operator rehearsing needle handling or bite orientation on neighboring, open practice cuts; those moments do not change or advance the repair and are best understood as technique calibration between genuine passes on the primary wound. The running closure itself develops steadily along the left-sided incision with consistent attention to bite symmetry, edge eversion, and controlled tension, and concludes with strand management and trimming.

The early portion establishes the operator’s orientation, instrument cadence, and bite geometry. In these opening moments, the hands repeatedly assume the opposing, across-the-wound configuration that will be used throughout the repair: one hand drives the needle perpendicular to the skin surface, and the other hand uses Adson-style tissue forceps to evert and present the dermal edge. The needle is consistently grasped on its proximal third to the mid-curve, giving a stable lever arm for a smooth semicircular pass. Across these early sequences, the operator rehearses and executes individual bites on the right-of-center and mid-left slits—bringing the needle to the near edge, lifting the opposite edge for exit, regrasping the needle tip with forceps when needed, and drawing the strand across. These short passes demonstrate essential elements of the technique—orthogonal approach, small even bites, atraumatic eversion, and a measured pull-through—but they do not culminate in a knot or a sustained closure on those practice cuts. Instead, they serve to standardize the geometry of the intended running pattern and calibrate the working triangle between the needle driver, the forceps, and the wound edge.

As the work consolidates on the intended target—the leftmost vertical wound already showing a line of continuous stitches—the operator transitions from rehearsal to advancement. At this point, hand dominance and approach are consistent with a running closure along the left-sided incision. The driver is usually in the left hand, aligned along the wound axis and hovering just lateral to the incision. The right hand holds Adson forceps, typically lifting or everting the right lip of the wound while the needle is brought in orthogonally for entry. The bites are small and even, taken a few millimeters from the edge, with forceps used to control the bite site rather than crush it. After each passage, the driver releases and re-grasps the needle to continue its arc or to reload it for the next forehand entry, and the strand is drawn through in line with the wound. The goal in each advance is consistent: maintain approximation and slight eversion while avoiding edge strangulation or gapping.

The middle of the procedure is a rhythm of controlled advancement, reloading, and tension management along this same left-sided line. The continuous thread is visible trailing along the wound, and as each bite is added, the stitch line lengthens in a uniform pattern. The operator keeps the suture organized away from the field, often arcing the free strand laterally or superiorly to avoid fouling the working corridor. Forceps work is deliberate: gently picking up the dermal margin to create an orthogonal entry point, projecting the wound edge toward the needle, and occasionally seizing the needle tip as it emerges to protect the tissue and facilitate controlled pull-through. Where visualization requires it, the driver crosses the wound axis momentarily to re-grasp the needle in an optimal orientation; otherwise, the needle is reoriented in the jaws with subtle wrist movements that preserve a perpendicular approach. Bites are mirrored on the far side at a matching depth, achieving even purchase across the gap and maintaining a clean, linear approximation.

Periodically, the camera captures short returns to the adjacent, open practice cuts, where single bites are placed or the needle is presented to an edge without completing a pass. These detours are notable for what they lack: there’s no sustained sequence of passes, no knotting, and no tensioning that approximates or finishes a closure on those cuts. They remain open and serve only as an auxiliary space for reinforcing hand positioning and needle angle. The line that actually moves forward, stitch by stitch, remains the left-sided wound with the continuous thread.

The technique on the main wound remains consistent. The driver holds the needle approximately one-third from the swage to two-thirds from the tip, depending on the angle necessary for entry; the arc is kept perpendicular to both the skin surface and the wound axis to prevent skiving or shallow bites. The forceps consistently evert the target edge so the epidermal-dermal junction is presented clearly to the needle. Where the tissue requires a hand-to-hand transfer, the forceps catch the needle tip, hand it to the driver, and the driver continues the arc smoothly through to the far side. Each passage is followed by a measured draw on the suture strand, setting the tension just enough to coapt the edges and maintain eversion without blanching. The suture line advances toward the distal end of the wound with this repetitive, disciplined cadence.

Several sequences explicitly show new passes being added adjacent to the existing stitches along the left incision. In these moments, the right-hand forceps lift the far lip, the left-hand driver advances the needle in an arc, and after emergence, the driver re-grasps to pull the strand through. The strand is then organized out of the way, readying the field for the next bite. Occasionally, the operator pauses to reposition the needle in the jaws to preserve a true right-angle entry on the next pass; this is especially apparent when working around the mid-to-distal portion of the wound, where the angle of approach needs adjusting to keep the arc orthogonal and the bites symmetric.

The spatial relationships throughout are precise. Hands oppose each other across the incision, forming a compact working triangle with the wound at the center. The driver aligns longitudinally, and the forceps approach perpendicular to the wound margin. When the driver crosses the midline to re-grasp or when instruments cross over momentarily during retrieval, it is purposeful and limited, immediately returning to the more stable parallel alignment. This consistency in instrument choreography helps maintain a clear view of the bite sites and prevents the suture from draping into the field or tangling over instruments.

Midway through the closure, the repaired segment shows a continuous, well-approximated line. The existing stitches provide mild eversion; bite spacing is short and even, and the edges sit flush without gapping. The operator continues to add passes along the same axis, each time retrieving the needle, repositioning it in the driver, and taking the next step forward. In a few passes, the right hand briefly controls the needle tip during reorientation, underscoring the collaborative role of the non-dominant hand in this technique—maintaining the arc and protecting tissue while keeping the strand aligned relative to the wound.

As the line nears completion, the focus shifts subtly from constructing bites to handling the strand and preparing for termination. Tension is balanced along the length of the closure; the operator lifts or tensions the thread to seat the last throws, ensuring the line is uniformly snug but not constrictive. Several sequences show controlled tensioning without taking new bites—an expected step before securing the end of a running closure. The wound edges remain coapted, the stitch line appears even, and there is no evidence of tissue crush or step-off at the margins.

The final steps concentrate on strand management over the same left-sided incision. The needle is removed from the active field, and attention turns to the free end and the suture loop at the terminus of the running line. Forceps elevate or steady the strand directly above the wound; the operator ensures the line is seated and the approximation is maintained. Scissors are then introduced from the left, blades oriented obliquely across the suture line to prevent accidental snipping of the tissue or undermining of the last throw. The assistant hand holds the strand steady while the cutting hand trims with controlled movements, keeping the blades close to the knot/tension point and avoiding contact with the skin pad. The camera shows repeated checks on the approximation during this trimming sequence; there is no additional penetration of tissue, and the closure’s geometry remains intact.

A few late frames show additional strand handling and trimming maneuvers, again entirely over the now-closed left wound. The instruments operate parallel to the incision, with the forceps stabilizing the strand and the scissors completing the cut. The continuous thread is now seated, trimmed, and lying flat. No further passes are taken, and no further manipulation of the right-side practice slits occurs.

Across the entire sequence, the closure that actually progresses is the continuous running line on the leftmost incision. The operator maintains a disciplined pattern: perpendicular needle entry, small and symmetric bites, gentle eversion with Adson forceps, careful reloading and regrasping of the needle to preserve the arc, and controlled pull-through and strand management. While the camera intermittently captures single bites or set-up moves on adjacent, unused slits—likely for demonstration or to maintain needle orientation—those actions are not sustained and do not advance any closure. The only line that receives a sequence of consecutive passes, organized strand handling, and a terminal trimming step is the left-sided wound.

By the end of the procedure, the left vertical incision is fully approximated along the segment worked. The stitch line is continuous and even, with slight eversion preserved. The free ends have been tensioned and cut, leaving a clean, low-profile running closure with no gapping or crossing of strands. The instruments withdraw, and the completed repair shows well-aligned edges and a consistent bite pattern from start to finish, reflecting a coherent and carefully executed running technique.
