COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens with the field oriented to a silicone teaching pad bearing three parallel vertical incisions: a center line already largely closed with a continuous pattern, an untouched left slit, and a clean right-side vertical incision that will be the focus of the procedure. The operator positions hands and instruments to begin closing the right-side incision using the selected interrupted technique. The left hand brings a needle driver into the center of the right-side wound, while the right hand, coming from the patient’s right, uses fine tissue forceps to grasp and gently elevate the near wound margin. The curved needle is mounted in the driver at about the proximal third to mid-body, with the tip perpendicular to the pad’s surface and the arc aligned to pass across the wound. These early preparatory movements concentrate on establishing an ergonomic, perpendicular approach to the entry site and setting eversion through gentle forceps traction so that the first bite can be driven cleanly from the near edge toward the far side. No tissue is pierced during these opening moments; they represent methodical setup and orientation for the first pass on the right incision.

Before the right-side closure proceeds, the operator briefly tends to a previously completed midline running closure. The needle driver holds the needle while the opposite hand manages the free strand at the distal end of the center incision. The focus here is housekeeping—snugging the terminal segment of the continuous line and trimming a tail—rather than new tissue bites. This short interlude over the midline displays tensioning and scissor work to clean the end of a finished running sequence. The needle remains under control in the driver while the free strand is stabilized and cut, and the instruments are handled to avoid crowding or crossing over the wound line. The continuous pattern is not extended; it is simply tidied at the distal end. Once this quick task is complete, the operator’s attention returns to the right-side incision for the main effort of the procedure.

After this brief detour, the center incision receives a few more moments of attention as the operator advances the previously established running line toward its distal end. The needle is grasped two-thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin surface, and driven from one wound edge to the opposite side with consistent spacing and slight eversion. The assistant hand keeps the free strand out of the field and tensions each loop as it is seated. This continues the preexisting continuous line toward the bottom, confirming that the midline wound is already under control and nearly complete. Following these few methodical passes, the middle wound is again tightened and organized. No knots are tied in these frames; the movements are characteristic of incremental advancement of a running stitch, with bites placed symmetrically and loops drawn down in sequence. The field is then cleared, and the rest of the session proceeds with the right-side incision as the focus.

Returning to the right incision, the operator’s instruments localize to the inferior portion of that wound where a single anchoring stitch and tails are visible. The needle driver hovers above the lower segment as the other hand introduces scissors to secure and trim the existing tails. No new bites are taken during this segment; it is a brief maintenance step that organizes the working end, clears clutter, and prepares the field for additional interrupted stitches. After trimming, the operator reintroduces the forceps and aligns the needle, ready to resume closure on the right side.

With the lower end organized, the operator begins placing new bites along the right incision, just superior to the initial knot. The left hand works the driver while the right hand’s forceps lift and evert the near edge. The needle, grasped two-thirds from its tip, is oriented perpendicular to the skin surface and advanced in a smooth arc. The entry point is set at an appropriate distance from the wound margin to ensure strength and avoid cheese-wiring. The needle passes through the near edge and arcs across to exit on the far side at a symmetric point. As the needle emerges, the driver regrips the needle body to draw the remainder of the needle and suture through. The strand is then tensioned to approximate the edges without blanching, with the operator attentive to maintaining slight eversion.

In the next sequence over the same right-side line, the technique continues with similar passes. At times the right hand does not use separate forceps; instead, the free strand is tensioned manually as the driver rotates the needle through the tissue. Each pass shows consistent needle orientation—perpendicular to the skin—followed by controlled regrasping to deliver the suture smoothly. After each pass, the strand is pulled to draw the edges together, maintaining even approximation. Although forceps are not always engaged in these frames, the motion remains consistent with the interrupted technique: a pass, then control of tension, and preparation for a knot.

The subsequent segment shows knot formation on the right incision. The left hand holds the needle driver over the stitch site with the needle parked in the jaws, while the right hand manages the free end to form and tighten instrument ties. The throws are set squarely over the incision, and the suture is cinched to seat the knot without strangulating the tissue. No additional bites are driven during this sequence; it is dedicated to tightening and securing the throw(s) for the stitch that has just been placed. The operator keeps the knot centered over the wound line and maintains even, moderate tension as the knot is locked.

With the knot secure, the operator repositions to create the next interrupted stitch on the same right-side incision. The right hand returns to the forceps, lifting the near edge and everting the dermis. The left hand regrips the needle at the proximal third to mid-body, again aligning the tip perpendicular to the surface. The driver approaches from superior-central, while the forceps present the near margin from the patient’s right, creating opposing vectors that stabilize the entry point. The needle is then driven through the near edge and across the wound, capturing equivalent tissue on the far side and reproducing the earlier symmetry. The pattern and spacing are consistent, with small, controlled bites that produce reliable edge approximation.

After each pass, the knotting routine is repeated. The driver is used for instrument ties while the free end is held with the assisting hand or forceps. At times, the right hand briefly grasps a suture tail or stabilizes the skin edge with fingers rather than forceps; nevertheless, the knots are seated centrally and tightened incrementally to maintain alignment. The operator trims slack and, where appropriate, cuts tails short to keep the field clear for additional stitches.

In one short segment, attention shifts briefly to the central incision where a new stitch is placed low on the line, and the strand is drawn through as initial knot throws develop. This appears to be a demonstration or completion task on the adjacent, already sutured wound, rather than a continuation of the main closure. No additional work is performed on the left incision. The field quickly resets, and all subsequent activity returns to the right-side wound.

The right incision closure advances in a methodical, stepwise manner. At times, the dominant hand holding the needle driver appears to change sides—often the left hand carries the driver, but in a few sequences the right hand takes the driver while the left hand aligns tissue or holds scissors. This handedness adjustment tracks with changes in approach angle as the operator moves superiorly along the incision. Throughout, needle grasping remains at the proximal third to mid-body, with the curve kept perpendicular to the skin surface to facilitate smooth arcing entry and exit.

As the closure progresses into the mid-portion of the right incision, several sequences show the forceps lifting the near edge to promote eversion and present crisp bite targets. The needle is aimed at a consistent offset from the wound margin, then driven across to the far side with careful depth control. Each pass is followed by pulling the suture through and establishing a knot with instrument ties. Knots are cinched down over the incision line and stabilized to prevent slippage. Where needed, the operator uses a cotton-tipped applicator or finger pressure to press and seat knots gently, ensuring that the knot stack lies flat and secure on the surface without burying or skewing the wound edges.

At intervals, the driver is seen hovering over the stitch site with no forceps actively holding tissue, suggesting a brief pause to evaluate spacing, confirm eversion, or prepare the next throw. The operator manages the suture, keeps trailing strands organized away from the working space, and avoids entanglement by maintaining clear, opposing hand positions around the wound. Scissors rest on the field until tails require trimming; then they are brought in from the side, nip the ends to a short, uniform length, and are set down again to clear the operative corridor.

Moving into the superior half of the right incision, the operator introduces a fresh suture and needle. The left hand repositions the driver and reloads the needle for optimal angle, while the right hand holds forceps to stabilize and slightly lift the right dermal edge. After reloading, the needle is driven through the near edge and across to the far side, and the suture is pulled through in preparation for the knot. As before, bites are symmetric and equidistant from the margin, and there is conscious control over tension so that the wound edges meet without inversion or gapping. A brief pass with gauze clears moisture and improves visibility, then instrument ties secure the new stitch. Tails are trimmed once the knot stack is firmly seated.

Several sequences demonstrate the consistent choreography of interrupted closure: near-to-far needle passage with controlled rotation; suture drawn through and organized; knots formed with the driver and either forceps or fingers controlling the free end; knot seating directly over the wound; tail trimming; and reloading the needle for the next bite a short distance superiorly. The repeated use of forceps to evert the edges is notable, though in a few instances the operator relies on suture tension alone—these moments are efficient but offer less direct control of eversion compared with active forceps support. Importantly, the edges nonetheless remain approximated, with slight eversion preserved across the pattern.

As the topmost gap on the right incision is addressed, the driver again grasps the needle at the proximal third, and the right hand’s forceps stabilize the near margin. The needle arcs through with consistent depth, and after passage the driver regrips to pull the suture through fully. Instrument ties follow, and the knot is cinched into place. A cotton swab or light fingertip pressure may be used to settle the knot. When the desired tension is achieved, scissors come in to trim the tails short, maintaining a tidy field and minimizing snag risk.

Near the completion of the closure, the operator performs final adjustments along the upper half of the right incision. The driver holds either the suture or the needle while the assisting hand briefly manipulates a loop or presses a knot stack to ensure it lies flat. Scissors then cut tails to a consistent length. The work remains localized to the right-side wound; the left and midline incisions are not manipulated at this stage. The hand positions mirror earlier segments: the driver working directly over the incision, the assisting instrument or hand opposite it, and both hands meeting over the wound line to secure and finish each stitch.

In the final moments, there is a pause in active suturing. The needle is not clearly visible in the driver’s jaws—most likely a brief reposition or instrument exchange. Both hands withdraw slightly, hovering just lateral and superior to the right incision. The right-side wound edges, now supported by a series of evenly spaced knots with short tails, remain well approximated. There is no eversion work or additional bite; the scene reads as a completion check and reset, with instruments moving out of the field.

Across the entire closure sequence, the technique remains consistent with an interrupted pattern, applied incrementally from the lower portion of the right incision toward the superior end. Key technical features are repeated and refined as the line advances:
- Needle control: The needle is reliably grasped at the proximal third to mid-body, oriented perpendicular to the surface, and driven in a smooth arc from near to far side. After emergence, the driver regrips to deliver the remainder of the needle and suture without tearing.
- Tissue handling: The forceps are used thoughtfully to evert and present edges during entry and exit; where forceps are momentarily absent, suture tension is applied carefully to maintain the same aim of slight eversion without crushing.
- Spacing and symmetry: Entry and exit points are matched on either side of the wound; bites are placed at consistent, appropriate distances from the margin to ensure stability and uniform approximation.
- Knot management: Instrument ties are formed over the incision line, tightened in controlled fashion, seated flush without burying, and tails trimmed to short, uniform lengths. At times a cotton applicator or fingertip helps lay a knot or adjust a loop.
- Ergonomics and field discipline: The driver generally operates from a superior or contralateral vector while the forceps present the near edge from the ipsilateral side, creating opposed, controlled hand positions. Suture strands are kept out of the operative zone to prevent entanglement, and scissors and hemostats rest off to the side until needed.

There are brief interludes at other incisions. Early on, the operator tidies and extends a preexisting running closure on the central line and trims its distal tail; later, a short sequence shows a single stitch placed and tightened on the center wound. These moments are isolated and do not affect the ongoing interrupted closure of the right incision. They appear to be quick housekeeping or demonstration steps on adjacent wounds, not changes to the main objective. The left incision remains untouched throughout.

By the end of the procedure, the right-side vertical incision is closed with a neat series of interrupted stitches. The edges meet evenly with slight eversion, knots are centered and well seated, and tails are trimmed uniformly short. No undue tension or gapping is evident along the line. Instruments withdraw after a short pause and repositioning, suggesting completion of the closure and a final visual confirmation of alignment and hemostasis. The result is a tidy interrupted closure of the right-side incision, accomplished through careful, repetitive execution of well-controlled bites, precise instrument ties, and consistent attention to tissue handling and suture management.
