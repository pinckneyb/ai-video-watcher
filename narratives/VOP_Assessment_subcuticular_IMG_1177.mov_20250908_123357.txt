Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
Your needle control, forceps use, and knot execution were competent, with steady arcs and organized instrument ties. However, the workflow never transitioned into an intradermal advance; momentum was interrupted by serial surface ties and full-thickness traverses. As a result, there was no continuous, symmetric subdermal path or flat, tension-balanced line.
