COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens in a quiet setup phase. On a small suturing card with a drawn linear “incision,” the left gloved hand hovers over the left side while all instruments rest parked on the drape. A curved needle with attached suture lies on the card; nothing is yet in hand and nothing touches the simulated wound.

Shortly thereafter, the right (dominant) hand enters with a gold‑ring needle driver and begins the first preparation. The needle is picked up and loaded across the mid–proximal third of its body, perpendicular to the driver. The left hand’s role is purely assistive at this stage, managing the free suture with fingers to keep loops off the field. Through small pronation–supination adjustments, the right hand orients the needle so the point faces left and the arc is perpendicular to the incision, setting up for a right‑to‑left bite. The driver is briefly set aside to adjust another ring‑handled instrument, then reclaimed to refine loading and approach.

As the first pass is readied, the left hand momentarily presents the needle and then picks up tissue forceps, holding them poised at the left margin without actually grasping “tissue.” The right hand completes the fine alignment. Between these frames and the next sequence, the first drive occurs: by the time the next views appear, the right hand is already following the curvature of the needle through the model and extracting it from the far side. The driver re‑grasps more proximally to control the emerging needle, and the suture is pulled through until slack is removed. The left hand continues to help by lifting and organizing the strand. With the pass complete, the right hand re‑presents and re‑grips the needle, orienting it for the next potential bite.

The technique then shifts into knot tying. The needle driver becomes a tying instrument while the left hand controls the short tail. The right hand enters loops formed around its jaws, seizes the short end, and pulls it through, creating alternating instrument throws. The knot is advanced centrally with coordinated, opposing tensions—left hand up/left, right hand down/right—to seat each throw neatly over the line. Scissors come in briefly to trim a suture tag near the center before the right hand returns to the driver for further throws. Once the knot is secure, the field is kept tidy, with suture lifted off the card to avoid entanglement.

The needle work resumes. The right hand again holds the needle driver, withdraws and reorients the needle after a pull‑through, and reloads it in a controlled, perpendicular posture while the left hand tensions the long limb for presentation. This sets the stage for another bite. The right hand then drives the needle across the incision line, following the arc with wrist rotation, extracts the needle, and draws the suture through, leaving an appropriate tail. Throughout, the left hand stays lateral, stabilizing the pad or pinching the suture, but never uses forceps to grasp edges.

Another tying sequence follows. The right hand uses the driver to execute instrument throws while the left hand organizes the strands and provides counter‑traction. The flow becomes rhythmic: pass, pull‑through, re‑grip, tie, seat, and trim. At one point, the right hand briefly picks up scissors to refine a tag, then reacquires the needle holder and re‑grips the needle, ensuring the arc remains perpendicular to the incision for the next right‑to‑left approach. The left hand maintains light traction to present the needle and keep the working corridor clear.

As the procedure progresses, the same disciplined cadence repeats. The right hand keeps the needle clamped around the proximal-middle third, approaches from the right, and aligns to the near edge. Small pronation–supination movements refine angle and depth. The left hand either stabilizes the pad or pinch‑controls the strands, rarely, if ever, using forceps on the “tissue.” After each pass, slack is managed deliberately: the suture is drawn away from the field to prevent drag, then the hands converge to tie. Alternating throws are laid with the driver grasping and passing the short end through loops formed by the left hand, and the knot is seated with opposing vectors. When necessary, the right hand trims a tail close to the knot with scissors, then parks the scissors and repositions the driver and needle for the next step.

Later in the sequence, the right hand reloads the needle with the left fingertips presenting it, parks unneeded instruments around the periphery (forceps left, scissors superior), and brings the tip to the right wound margin. The needle is held at roughly 90 degrees to the surface, ready for another near‑to‑far pass; the tip appears to contact or just start entry, but full penetration isn’t shown in those frames. The fine positioning continues into the next interval—alignment is perfected, the suture is kept clear, and the working field remains unobstructed.

A tightening-and-trimming vignette follows: with the left hand elevating a strand for exposure, the right hand’s scissors cut a tail close to the knot. Both the scissors and needle driver are then parked to the right; the forceps sit idle on the left. Hands briefly leave the field, then the left hand returns to pick up a new strand, setting up for whatever comes next.

The final minutes quiet down. Both hands hover at the margins; instruments encircle the card without being used. The needle holder sits closed on the right, scissors rest at the top, and two forceps lie on the left. A loose suture drapes over the card. By the very end, the right hand floats near the needle driver but does not engage. The curved needle lies free on the drape above the pad, thread slack across the field. The scene pauses in an idle configuration, a tidy endpoint after a series of practiced cycles.

Across the full timeline, the technique reads as a consistent, methodical rhythm: precise needle loading and perpendicular approach; rotational passage following the needle’s arc; careful pull‑through with re‑grasping as needed; instrument ties with alternating throws seated by balanced, opposing traction; and clean trimming. The left hand remains a dedicated assistant—presenting the needle, managing strands, and stabilizing the field—while the right hand executes the driven steps. Instruments are conscientiously parked between actions, and the suture is kept off the field to maintain order. The overall flow conveys deliberate, stepwise suturing on a training pad, repeated in measured cycles, punctuated by brief pauses and resets.
