COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a methodical, largely uninterrupted closure of the left‑most vertical incision on the pad. From setup through the final maneuvers at the superior end, the work proceeds in an orderly inferior‑to‑superior sequence using orthogonal, symmetric bites consistent with a simple interrupted technique. The operator’s hands maintain a steady rhythm of tissue presentation, perpendicular needle passage, suture pull‑through, instrument tying, and eventual tail management, with only brief interludes to trim or demonstrate on adjacent incisions that do not alter the progression of this closure.

The session opens with a clear setup at the lower third of the left vertical slit. The right hand controls a needle driver loaded with a curved needle gripped on the proximal third to mid‑body, the arc oriented perpendicular to the synthetic skin surface. The left hand alternates forceps use to gently lift and evert the near dermal edge. Instruments bracket the wound: the driver approaches from the operator’s left/top‑left, while the forceps enter from the right/below‑right (0–14 s; 15–29 s). The first needle passages are standard forehand arcs—entry at the left wound margin a few millimeters from the edge, controlled advance across the gap, and exit at the contralateral edge—followed by re‑grasping near the needle tip for perpendicular withdrawal. The suture is drawn through smoothly, leaving a tail that lies diagonally across the field. Early passes remain untied as the operator builds a working rhythm along the inferior portion (30–44 s; 45–59 s).

Having established the first passes, the operator transitions to securing the earliest stitch near the lower half. With the left hand holding the driver and the right hand managing forceps and the free end, instrument ties are executed with clean, alternating throws. Tension is applied in line with the incision to snug the knot without crushing the tissue. Eversion remains modest, and approximation is crisp (60–74 s). This immediately sets the tone for the closure: maintain perpendicular bite angles, symmetric entry/exit spacing, and controlled, gentle handling of the synthetic dermis.

The next sequence returns to the inferior third where the left hand with forceps elevates the near edge and the right hand with the driver positions the needle to enter the left margin. The stroke is again perpendicular to the skin surface; the needle is driven in a smooth wrist arc, and the passage across is completed with a re‑grip to draw the suture through. The edges are kept in plane with only minimal tenting from the forceps (75–89 s; 90–104 s). The operator begins to set up the next instrument ties, using a red‑ring assistance tool to control the tail while the driver captures the working end, ensuring the strands cross above the wound without entrapping adjacent tissue (105–119 s). Each tied stitch consolidates lower‑segment approximation and establishes an even cadence and spacing pattern for those to follow.

A brief instructional detour shows a single pass being demonstrated on the right‑column incision, with the right hand on the needle holder and the left hand using forceps to present the near edge for a perpendicular bite and partial pull‑through (120–134 s). No further work proceeds there, and the closure returns immediately to the left incision.

Re‑focusing at the lower‑left segment of the primary incision, the operator initiates another stitch. The right hand with forceps—identifiable by a red grip—elevates the left margin, exposing the dermis 2–4 mm from the edge. The left hand, again on the driver, orients the needle perpendicular to the surface, grips the body roughly two‑thirds from the tip, and advances into the left edge with a controlled arc (135–149 s). The subsequent frames show the ongoing theme: one hand presents and everts, the other drives; the needle follows its curvature across the gap; the suture is pulled through gently and parked laterally; and, when appropriate, instrument ties secure each pass, stabilizing the approximation without over‑tightening (150–164 s; 165–179 s). Inferiorly, a small cluster of early knots is visible, while attention shifts progressively cranially.

A short housekeeping interval centers over the middle incision, where the driver hovers and scissors appear to trim or clear suture material without grasping tissue for new bites (180–194 s). That interlude closes without advancing any other line. The operator returns to the left incision, now near its lower third again, to place a new bite. Here, the left hand steadies the near edge with forceps, and also briefly guides the needle at entry. The right hand, on the needle driver, receives the advancing needle tip after the pass to complete withdrawal (195–209 s). With edges already less gaped thanks to prior stitches, each new throw proceeds smoothly.

The subsequent passes move into the upper portion of the same line. The left hand on the driver and the right hand alternating between forceps and strand control coordinate a textbook sequence: the needle, grasped about one‑third from the swage, is driven perpendicular to the incision; after penetration, the driver releases and regrips to follow the curve across; and the suture is drawn through with the right hand tensioning diagonally across the field to maintain approximation while avoiding tissue drag (210–224 s). Instrument ties start but are not completed in that subset of frames, underscoring the careful pacing of passage, pull‑through, and securing.

As the suture line marches upward, work concentrates near the superior end. On one pass, the driver remains left of the wound while forceps stabilize the right edge to ensure symmetry of bite depth and lateral spacing; the suture is drawn through and an instrument tie begins immediately, with both hands converging over the wound to square the throws (225–239 s). Then, attention shifts briefly to the inferior portion of this same incision, where the right hand uses pickups to steady the edge while the left hand alternates between anchoring the driver and managing the ends to cinch and set the knot; the needle is momentarily parked to allow secure tying (240–254 s). This periodic return to lower segments to tie and trim tails is a consistent rhythm: it tidies the field and prevents confusion as the closure proceeds upward.

There is a transitional moment with scissors trimming on the left incision, after which the right hand hovers near the right‑column wound, poised to engage a needle that lies concave toward the incision. No stitches are placed there during that interval, and no traction is applied; the scene reads as preparation rather than progression (255–269 s). Immediately afterward, the operator is back at the superior end of the left incision. Scissors briefly appear, then the right hand reappears with a loaded driver while the left hand switches to tissue forceps to elevate the superior‑left edge. With the near edge presented, the driver aligns the needle to enter perpendicular, forehand from left‑to‑right, readying the next stitch at the top of the line (270–284 s).

The stitch is taken and drawn through at the superior portion, with the left hand controlling the near edge and the right hand first driving then tensioning the free strand across the field. The suture is kept taut but respectful of tissue, and after passage the left hand briefly takes the driver near the wound, reflecting smooth role‑swapping to maintain control and visibility (285–299 s). Another pass follows immediately, again on the superior half: the driver, now consistently in the left hand, loads the needle at the proximal‑to‑middle third and drives perpendicular across; the right hand with the red‑banded forceps steadies the edge and controls the pull‑through. Knot tying is anticipated but not shown in those frames (300–314 s).

A short, separate teaching moment takes place over the middle incision: a bite is placed at the superior portion of that line and an instrument tie is initiated. This does not alter or interrupt the left‑sided closure; rather, it serves as a brief demonstration isolated to that central slit before attention returns to the main work (315–329 s).

Back at the upper third of the left wound, the right hand holds the driver while the left hand uses tissue forceps to evert and stabilize the near edge. The bite is initiated with the needle grasped at the proximal third from the tip, aligned perpendicular to the skin. Symmetric placement and spacing are again emphasized, anchoring the aesthetic and mechanical consistency of the closure (330–344 s). The next sequence completes a pass and proceeds directly into instrument tying. The left hand on the driver and the right hand with pickups manage the suture ends, directing tension along the incision axis to seat the knot. The long end is pulled to snug approximation, and the throws are squared and tightened without twisting the tissue (345–359 s).

With the superior end now populated by recent passes, a series of frames shows strand retrieval and final tensioning rather than fresh needle penetrations. The driver remains parked just above and lateral to the top of the wound while the right hand alternates between forceps and scissors to streamline existing strands, refine approximation, and prepare for tail trimming (360–374 s). Immediately afterward, another stitch is initiated at the top: the right hand holds the needle driver, the left hand’s forceps evert the near edge, and the needle is oriented perpendicular to begin the entry stroke. The edges inferiorly remain stable from prior sutures, and the top is manipulated carefully to ensure matched entry and exit points across the gap (375–389 s).

That pass is then completed and secured. The curved needle—gripped about two‑thirds from the tip—is driven across perpendicular to the skin, the suture is pulled through, and the right hand elevates and tensions the standing end superior‑right of the wound while instrument ties are formed and tightened at the top stitch. The knot is seated with the strand pulled diagonally up‑right to maintain apposition and avoid puckering. Preparation to cut the tails follows (390–404 s). A subsequent series continues at this same superior location: the driver remains active at the top of the incision, the left hand alternates between pickups and strand management, and the needle is positioned for another orthogonal pass while tensioning of already placed throws keeps the edges approximated without gapping (405–419 s).

Near the end of the sequence, the driver and forceps straddle the upper third of the same wound, with the needle mounted at the proximal third of the curve and aligned for another pass. The forceps stabilize and evert one edge while the driver positions over the opposite side. After this positioning, instruments withdraw and the wound’s appearance remains unchanged in those frames, suggesting a final check of alignment and spacing before the next or final tie (420–434 s). A very brief shot shows a hand pointing over the central pad while the right‑most incision lies unattended with loosely placed vertical‑mattress‑like throws in view—a passive moment that does not involve manipulation or closure on that line (435–439 s).

Across the entire closure, the same technical hallmarks repeat and reinforce consistency:
- Needle control: The driver almost invariably grips the curved needle at roughly the proximal third to two‑thirds from the tip, presenting the arc perpendicular to the skin and tracking it with wrist motion across the wound. After partial penetration, the needle is routinely released and re‑grasped near the tip for smooth exit and safe retrieval.
- Tissue handling: Adson/pickups are used to lift and evert only the immediate edge being entered, avoiding deep crush or wide tenting. Entry and exit points are maintained at a consistent distance from the margin, matched side‑to‑side, which ensures even tension distribution and a neat, ladder‑like stitch line.
- Suture management: The free strand is routinely drawn diagonally across the field, often superior‑right, to keep the working area clear. When tying, the driver and assisting instrument cross above the wound with deliberate, squared throws; tension is applied in the direction of the incision’s axis to seat knots snugly without strangulation.
- Hand position evolution: At the outset, the right hand often holds the driver while the left hand manages tissue. As the work moves superiorly, roles occasionally invert to optimize angles—particularly at the top of the wound—yet the fundamental opposition of driver on one side and pickups on the other is preserved. During tying, both hands converge centrally over the wound; during passage, they straddle it with a balanced working triangle.

There are brief, non‑progressing interludes away from the left‑sided closure—trimming over the center incision, a demonstrative pass on the middle line, and a short setup gesture over the right column. None of these alter the main storyline of the closure and no sustained suturing continues on those lines during the sequences that matter for the left wound. Notably, a few frames capture the rightmost incision with loose vertical‑mattress‑like throws; this differs from the simple interrupted pattern used to complete the left incision and appears only as a background view without active manipulation.

By the end, the left vertical incision is functionally closed from its inferior end to the superior margin with a continuous row of evenly spaced, simple interrupted stitches. The lower half shows well‑seated knots with tails trimmed after periodic tying sequences; the mid‑portion maintains consistent spacing and tidy approximation; and the superior end receives the final passes and ties, with the last throws tightened while the strand is directed up and to the right to maintain apposition. Throughout, the edges are brought together without gapping, with modest eversion and minimal tissue trauma. The instruments withdraw from the top after a last positioning check and tensioning, leaving a straight, well‑approximated closure characterized by orthogonal bites, symmetric entry/exit points, and neatly secured instrument ties—all hallmarks of a careful, consistent simple interrupted technique carried from the bottom to the top of the same incision.
