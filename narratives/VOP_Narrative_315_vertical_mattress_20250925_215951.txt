COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single, continuous repair carried out on the same horizontal incision of the practice skin pad — the central, lower horizontal slit located in the lower–central/mid‑lower region of the board (the middle of the three parallel slits). From the first frames through the end, all instrument activity, needle work, suture management and knot tying are concentrated on that one linear wound. The team progresses methodically along the defect, placing and securing a row of interrupted sutures to approximate the synthetic dermal edges, then tidying and inspecting the closure until activity subsides and the pad is rotated and stabilized for final review.

Initial approach and first passes (0:00–0:44)
The sequence opens with both hands positioned over the lower‑central incision. Early frames show a standard two‑instrument technique: a needle driver in one hand and fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style) in the other. A curved, swaged needle is grasped in the driver at roughly the mid‑shaft/proximal portion to provide controlled, predictable rotation through the tissue. The assistant hand stabilizes and everts the near edge with the forceps while the driver brings the needle in a downward/medial arc to take a shallow full‑thickness dermal bite on the far edge. Wound edges are gently lifted and aligned to provide even apposition; the operator avoids excessive traction that might puck er the synthetic skin. Movements are coordinated and compact: the instruments cross briefly above the incision, working within a few centimeters of one another to pass the needle, draw the suture through, and prepare for knot tying.

Continuing placement and technique consolidation (0:45–1:44)
Over the next minute or two, the operator repeats the same pattern, advancing to adjacent positions along the same linear defect. The right and left hands alternate dominant roles depending on the bite: sometimes the left needle driver advances the needle while the right forceps steadies tissue and controls slack; at other times the orientation flips as the operator repositions to optimize angle and access. The needle grip remains consistently proximal on the shaft, permitting a smooth arc and predictable exit. Tissue handling is deliberate: the forceps picks up only as much tissue as needed to align the epidermal margins and slightly evert the edges when desired to avoid inversion. The stitching pattern is interrupted — each pass is followed by controlled suture tensioning and tying rather than a continuous running pattern. Scissors and hemostat instruments are available nearby and are intermittently introduced to hold suture tails, provide counter‑tension, or prepare to cut.

Mid‑procedure: coordinated passing, transfer and knotting (1:45–3:14)
As the procedure progresses, the operator works in the mid portion of the incision, frequently placing new stitches between previously tied sutures. The hands converge closely over the wound (typically within 1–4 cm), the needle driver and forceps alternately grasping needle or suture as needed. In several frames the needle is seen being transferred between instruments — the forceps orient the needle tip while the driver accepts it mid‑shaft for the decisive pass through the opposite edge. After each through‑and‑through bite, the free suture tail is managed with a fine pickup while the driver applies counter‑tension. Knot formation is often executed with instrument ties: a ringed hemostat or needle driver is used to provide secure throws, and the assistant uses forceps to control the short tail. The operator periodically uses a hemostat or scissors to hold and tension the strands as throws are stacked, then trims excess material as appropriate.

Intermittent pauses: inspection and suture organization (3:15–4:14)
Between active needle passes, the team pauses to arrange suture tails, inspect apposition, and adjust tension. Several intervals show no visible needle — instead, both hands are occupied with knot tying, manipulating existing suture loops, or stabilizing the pad. During these phases the left or right hand may rest on the pad edge or reposition instruments while the other prepares the next throw. Instruments rest on the board in some frames when hands briefly stabilize the model to improve access. These short pauses ensure consistent spacing and spacing of sutures and allow the operator to evaluate margin eversion and tissue approximation before placing subsequent bites.

Reinforcing technique and adding adjacent stitches (4:15–5:44)
Activity resumes with additional passes placed immediately adjacent to earlier stitches. The operator continues to use a curved needle, mid‑shaft grip and coordinated two‑handed technique. Forceps consistently hold the near edge and lift a small bite, while the driver advances the needle across the wound in a smooth rotational motion. The operator demonstrates controlled depth — bites are superficial enough to approximate epidermal layers without excessive puckering, yet deep enough to secure the synthetic dermis. With each pass, the suture is pulled snugly and secured with instrument‑based knot tying; the assistant routinely steadies or receives the needle and provides counter‑traction while knots are formed.

Tackling medial segments and refining hand positions (5:45–8:14)
As the team moves toward the most medial portion of the incision, hand positions shift subtly to optimize ergonomics. Often the needle driver approaches from one side while the forceps approach from the opposite side; the hands remain close and sometimes cross, with the needle driver slightly more medial and the forceps slightly lateral relative to the local stitch site. There are repeated transfers of the needle between instruments — the operator uses the assistant forceps to orient and the driver to draw the needle through. Throughout, the operator maintains a consistent needle grip around the body of the curve, allowing predictable control and minimizing stress on the simulated tissue.

Knot tying and suture tail management concentrated activity (8:15–10:14)
A substantial portion of frames across this segment show active knot‑tying and suture tail handling rather than fresh needle entries. The operator frequently uses the needle driver and a hemostat or straight clamp to perform throws; the assistant’s forceps manage tails and provide stabilization for the knot. Instrument tips dwell very close to the wound line during knot work — within a few centimeters — and the hands cross above the suture when forming throws. Occasional frames show the operator organizing multiple suture tails, smoothing the line of knots, and ensuring consistent eversion. These organizational steps prevent entanglement and maintain a clean operative field as the row of interrupted sutures is filled.

Late passes and final closure maneuvers (10:15–12:44)
In the latter third of the recording, the operator completes the remaining lateral stitches and finishes final throws. Needle passes continue in the same interrupted fashion: tissue is grasped, needle advanced in an arc, suture drawn through and tied. Some frames capture the needle being held nearer to the driver’s jaws for precise short bites near previously tied knots. The operator remains mindful of spacing, placing new bites in the gaps between existing stitches to produce an even series of closely spaced interrupted closures. Instrument choreography stays consistent — one hand manipulates the needle, the other manipulates tissue and suture tails, and instruments may briefly swap roles as dictated by hand orientation.

Inspection, tension adjustments and trimming (12:45–14:59)
After the mechanical work of passing and tying is largely completed, the operator devotes attention to final tension adjustments and trimming. Several frames show no needle present; activity is focused on pulling suture tails taut, finalizing knot security, and cutting excess suture. The operator uses a hemostat or scissors to cut the tails and then smooths knots by gentle tightening. During these phases both hands often converge centrally over the closure, alternating between holding tissue and trimming strands. The operator also repositions the pad and rests hands at the board edges to rotate and orient the model for a final look.

Final inspection and pad manipulation (15:00–6:30 remaining)
In the final frames the pair stabilizes and reorients the pad to assess the completed repair. Hands are sometimes placed on opposite top corners of the foam board to rotate or present the closure to camera view; instruments rest outside the immediate working zone. No further needle passes are performed. The series of interrupted knots along the incision is inspected for even spacing and approximation; any minor tension adjustments are made by pulling or smoothing suture tails. The wound margins lie closely apposed with slight eversion produced by knot tension, which is commonly desired to counteract inversion during healing in real tissue.

Technique consistency and evolution
Across the entire procedure the surgeon employs a consistent interrupted suturing technique using a curved, swaged needle and a two‑instrument method: a needle driver in the dominant hand and fine tissue forceps in the assisting hand. Grip location on the needle remains largely at the mid‑shaft or proximal third, affording controlled rotation and predictable exit angles. The operator repeatedly uses the same motion: lift and align the near edge with forceps, drive the curved needle in an arc through the opposite edge, draw the suture through, and tie instrument‑based knots while the assistant stabilizes tails. Over time, technique refines modestly — hand positions and instrument grips are adjusted for optimal access to medial or lateral segments, and knot‑tying becomes fluid and efficient. When cosmetic approximation is required, slight margin eversion is achieved consistently. The operator avoids excessive tissue tension, and suture placement depth is kept fairly constant (superficial dermal bites appropriate for the simulated tissue).

Hand and instrument choreography relative to the incision
Hands and tools remain tightly coordinated with the wound throughout. Instruments approach from opposite sides, with tips converging over a small active zone directly adjacent to the incision. The interplay alternates between needle handling, tissue stabilization and knot work: the needle driver supplies motion and torque for passes; forceps control tissue and suture tails; hemostats or scissors are intermittently brought in to secure tails or cut. Distances between instruments are short (commonly 1–4 cm), enabling precise transfers and quick knot formation. Over the run of the repair, the hands shift position to match the local point of work — lateral when engaging peripheral bites, more central and cross‑handed when tying knots in tight spaces. At the end, hands move to the pad margins to reposition and present the repair.

Final condition of the closure
By the conclusion of the recording the incision is fully approximated with a continuous row of well‑placed instrument‑tied interrupted sutures. Knots sit on the surface with short tails trimmed and organized; the wound edges are brought into close apposition with modest, intentional eversion. There is no evidence of gaping at any point along the repaired line; spacing and bite depth are consistent, producing a neat, evenly tensioned closure suitable for the simulated dermis. Instrument activity subsides, no further needle passes are performed, and the pad is rotated and stabilized for final review.

Notable observational details and limitations
Throughout the recording there are intermittent frames where the needle is not visible; during those periods the operator is engaged in knot tying, trimming or organizing suture tails rather than performing fresh needle passes. At times instruments rest on the board between maneuvers, and occasionally the exact needle transfer between instruments is obscured by hand overlap or oblique camera angles. Despite these transient visual gaps, the procedural intent and flow are clear: the operator consistently places adjacent interrupted stitches along the same single linear defect, secures each with instrument ties and trims the tails, and proceeds in a methodical, contiguous progression from one end of the wound toward the other until a complete, secure closure is achieved.

Summary
The video documents a focused interrupted closure of one central lower horizontal incision on a synthetic skin pad. Using a curved swaged needle held near mid‑shaft, the operator and assistant work in close coordination: forceps lift and approximate tissue while a needle driver advances the needle through matching bites, followed by controlled instrument‑based knot tying and suture tail management. Hand positions evolve to maintain optimal access as the repair advances medially and laterally, and final inspections and trimming leave a neatly approximated incision with evenly spaced, securely tied interrupted sutures and slight eversion of the margins.
