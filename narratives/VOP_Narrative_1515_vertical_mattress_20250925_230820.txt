COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video documents a focused skin-approximation exercise on the right-most vertical incision of the practice pad. From the first frame to the last, the operator works exclusively on that single lateral vertical slit, progressing a line of simple interrupted sutures along its length. The work moves methodically from one end of the incision toward the other, with repeated cycles of needle passage, tissue presentation, suture advancement, knot formation and tail management. Instruments are consistent throughout: a curved, swaged needle manipulated with a needle driver in the dominant hand and fine toothed forceps (Adson-style or pickup) in the nondominant hand to present and stabilize the wound edge and manage suture tails. The synthetic dermal material receives shallow, edge-biased bites designed to approximate epidermal/dermal layers with slight eversion; no deep layer or buried mattress technique is applied.

Initial placement and approach (0 – ~90 s)
The operator begins over the vertical lateral incision with the needle driver held vertically above the wound and forceps stationed lateral to the incision. Early passes show the needle grasped near mid-shaft to the distal third, the driver aligning the needle tip for entry at a near‑perpendicular angle to the wound edge. The nondominant forceps present the near edge and control the suture tail while the needle is rotated in a controlled wrist arc, taking short, superficial bites through the synthetic dermis. Hands are close (typically 2–4 cm apart) in a pincer configuration that facilitates accurate needle purchase and immediate control of the suture strand. The operator draws the suture through and prepares to tension and tie; a loop and tail become evident in the nearby field as the first stitches are seated.

Progression along the line — sequential interrupted placement (≈90 – 240 s)
After the initial bites, placement proceeds in a steady, sequential fashion along the line. The pattern is consistent: the nondominant pickup lifts and everts the near edge slightly, the needle driver approaches from above/medial or above/right and advances the curved needle in a short arc through the opposing edge, the suture is drawn through, and the pair prepare for knotting. The needle is repeatedly grasped in the needle driver proximate to the body (not at the tip), allowing controlled rotation through the tissue arc; occasional re-grasps occur to reposition the needle for optimal entry and exit points. Spatially, the needle driver often occupies a superior/medial orientation relative to the incision while the forceps sit inferolateral, creating a compact working triangle over a few centimeters of pad surface. The operator keeps each bite shallow and close to the wound margin, prioritizing edge-to-edge apposition with slight eversion rather than deep purchase.

The operator advances from inferior to superior (distal to proximal) along the slit. As stitches are added, previously tied sutures are visible inferiorly and the operator moves superiorly, adding new interrupted bites adjacent to the last knot. Hands intermittently cross during needle transfer and knot work, but generally maintain the same relative positions: the needle driver controlling needle trajectory from above/medial and the pickup stabilizing laterally/inferiorly.

Mid-procedure tying and refinement (≈240 – 420 s)
Midway through the recording the sequence alternates more frequently between needle passage and knot formation. Several frames show the pair working closely to reduce suture slack, form instrument ties, and manage tails. At times the needle driver is used both to manipulate the needle and to form the knot; the nondominant forceps both present tissue and hold tails for secure throws. The operator’s technique remains predominantly simple interrupted stitches: place a bite, draw suture through, tie and trim or leave short tails, then proceed to the next adjacent bite.

Throughout this phase the clinician maintains consistent hand ergonomics: the dominant hand provides fine needle control with short wrist rotations and occasional re-grasps of the needle nearer the swage or midshaft for leverage; the nondominant hand provides traction, approximation and slight eversion. The bites are even in spacing and depth, emphasizing cosmetic edge apposition on the synthetic epidermal surface. Instrument coordination is tight — the tips meet less than a few centimeters above the incision during needle transfer — and the operator’s head leans in to monitor needle trajectory and tissue alignment.

Final passes, knot finishing and suture management (≈420 – 540 s)
As the operator approaches the superior extent, the sequence becomes dominated by completing the last bites, seating knots, and trimming/managing tails. The needle driver continues to be grasped in a mid-to-distal shaft position to deliver perpendicular-to-oblique entries that exit the opposing margin in a controlled arc. The forceps remain the principal tool for edge presentation and tail control. Final stitches are placed adjacent to the earlier row to produce an evenly spaced line of apposed epidermal edges with mild eversion, consistent bite-to-bite technique, and minimal tissue puckering.

Instrument exchanges and compact movements characterize these frames: small rotations of the needle driver, brief crossings of hands, and short transfers of suture tails to maintain tension while forming secure throws. The operator repeatedly inspects approximation and adjusts tension to avoid gaping; the synthetic skin edges respond with slight eversion when sutures are tightened. The work is methodical, with the operator alternating needle passes and knot-tying until the linear defect is uniformly closed along its length.

Final adjustments, suture tail handling and procedural close (≈540 – 600 s)
In the closing segment the clinician performs final tightening and tail management. Several frames show knot formation and suture tails being organized or trimmed. At times the needle and/or driver are not clearly visible and hands appear to be manipulating suture tails and knots rather than introducing fresh passes; these intervals reflect the tying/finishing phase rather than new bites. One late frame in particular shows a hand remote from the incision with no instrument engagement visible; this is a brief deviation from earlier active needle work but is consistent with final suture handling and procedural wrap-up.

Throughout the last sequences the surgeon preserves the established technique: short superficial, edge-focused bites, mid-shaft needle grips for controlled arc passage, and forceps-assisted approximation with slight eversion. A metal ring instrument and other tools lie idle at times as the operator focuses on the row of interrupted knots. Hands remain largely clustered over the right-side incision, and a card or procedural marker is placed over the pad as part of finalization in the closing frames.

Technique characteristics and consistency across the procedure
The technique used is consistent with simple interrupted skin closure throughout. Bites are superficial-to-mid dermal on a synthetic epidermal model, taken close to the incision margin to ensure edge approximation. The curved needle is usually grasped at or just proximal to mid‑shaft to allow reliable control of the arc; occasional re‑grasping nearer to the hub occurs for leverage when withdrawing or seating a stitch. Tissue is stabilized with toothed forceps, producing slight intentional eversion for epidermal edge apposition. Knot formation is instrument-based (instrument ties), with the dominant hand operating the needle driver for both needle passage and forming throws while the nondominant forceps manage tails and present edges. This pattern remains essentially unchanged from the first pass through to the last — the operator emphasizes controlled, reproducible bites and even spacing, progressing sequentially along the wound.

Hand and instrument motion over time
Hand positions evolve only modestly: initially both hands adopt a tight pincer configuration for needle entry, then maintain that close relationship throughout. The dominant hand predominantly resides slightly superior/medial to the incision line as it drives the needle; the nondominant remains lateral/inferior presenting the edge and tails. Brief hand crossings occur during needle transfer and knotwork, but the relative spatial organization — driver above/medial, pickup below/lateral — is preserved. Movement amplitude is small, relying on wrist and finger rotation rather than sweeping arm motions, which supports precise arc control of the curved needle and predictable exit points. The operator maintains proximity to the work (typically within a few centimeters) to ensure fine control of suture placement and knot security.

Final appearance of the closure
By the end of the recording the right-most vertical incision is uniformly approximated along its length. Interrupted knots lie along the line at regular intervals; suture tails have been managed and trimmed in final frames, and the wound edges are closely apposed with slight eversion. No additional incisions are addressed at any point: the entire procedure is concentrated on this single lateral slit, with stitches added sequentially progressing along the same seam until the closure is complete. Overall the technique is methodical, consistent, and focused on superficial dermal approximation appropriate to the simulated skin model, with careful attention to spacing, tension and edge eversion to achieve an even, secure interrupted closure.
