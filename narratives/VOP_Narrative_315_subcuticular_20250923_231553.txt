COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with both hands coming into the upper half of the practice pad to work on the short horizontal wound located near the superior edge. From the very first frames the workflow is deliberate and consistent: one instrument team handles the needle in a driver while the other controls the tissue with fine forceps, and the working zone is focused on this same topmost transverse incision throughout the recording. The wound is a clean, superficial slit with clearly demarcated epidermal margins and a visible yellow subdermal plane; the rest of the pad contains previously completed sutured patterns that remain largely undisturbed except for brief, intermittent handling.

Initial setup and repeated positioning (0–90 s)
At the outset the left hand presents a needle driver while the right hand brings forceps to tent and evert the near wound edge. The needle is mounted in the driver around the proximal-to-mid third of the curve, the jaws closed firmly so the needle’s arc can be manipulated precisely. The tip is consistently presented at or just off the epidermal margin with the plane of the curve oriented to allow an orthogonal (near‑perpendicular) tissue bite. The forceps repeatedly approach the opposite lip to lift just enough dermis to expose a clear dermal target; the grip on the tissue is gentle, avoiding crushing while producing slight eversion. These early sequences consist of careful alignments, frequent regrips of the needle in the driver, and small adjustments of the entry angle. The suture tail is managed away from the field so it does not tangle.

These preparation cycles recur across several early time windows. The team continually refines bite angle—repositioning the driver, rotating the needle grip between proximal and mid-shaft holds as needed—and the forceps maintain a steady role in presenting the dermal edge. Hands remain opposed across the incision, separated by only a few millimetres to a couple of centimetres, forming a compact working triangle directly over the wound. Occasionally the left hand briefly swaps instruments (introducing scissors or repositioning a second driver), but the left-driver / right-forceps pattern is the dominant arrangement.

First passes and progression to full passes (90–240 s)
Following the initial alignment steps, the operator begins to drive the needle. The first documented entries show the needle oriented perpendicular to the skin and taken in a controlled forehand or right-to-left arc depending on the approach. The right-hand forceps tenderly tent and evert the lip at the point of entry while the driver advances the needle through the epidermis and dermis; the needle is then regrasped as it exits the far side to complete the arc. Bite depths are consistent and symmetrical: the trainee/operator aims for equivalent dermal depths on either side of the slit to encourage apposition. Whenever a full pass is completed the needle is regripped predictably—often at a slightly different fulcrum point—to optimize purchase for the next manipulation.

During this middle period the pattern of activity is recurring: load and align → tent and evert with forceps → drive the needle across the gap following the curvature → regrip and draw the suture through → manage the free ends and, at times, trim excess. At several points scissors are briefly introduced to trim suture tails, then the driver is reloaded to continue. Instruments straddle the wound; the driver commonly approaches from the operator’s left or superior-left and the forceps counter from the right or superior-right. The suture strand is kept taut but not under excessive tension while the needle is worked.

Consolidation of interrupted stitches and coordinated hand work (240–320 s)
As the sequence continues the operator repeats these cycles along the same superior slit. The needle is consistently grasped at approximately the proximal third to two-thirds of the curve depending on the required working length; this allows small, precise arcs rather than large sweeping motions. The forceps habitually lift a few millimetres of tissue to evert the edge and present the dermis; after passage the forceps sometimes guide the emerging needle point to control exit location and preserve tissue alignment.

There are multiple clear instances where a stitch is passed completely and the suture material is drawn through and managed on either side of the wound in preparation for tying. The left hand, when acting as driver, crosses slightly above the wound line as it advances the needle; the right hand keeps the opposing edge exposed and protected from inadvertent needle trauma. When the driver is on the right (observed briefly in mid-sequence), the roles mirror but the hand–instrument dynamics remain the same: driver controls the needle arc, forceps present tissue and guide exit.

Repeated re-loading and angle refinement are prominent. The operator frequently repositions needle purchase, re-grips the swage-proximal body of the needle to change the fulcrum and to ensure a perpendicular trajectory through increasingly small target depths. The suture strand trails behind the needle and is continually controlled to avoid snagging on the pad or prior knots. Throughout these steps the previously sutured midline and zig‑zag patterns lower on the pad are left alone, aside from a few brief occasions when scissors or a second instrument cross the area for trimming or to park the driver.

Mid-procedure management and occasional diversions (320–420 s)
In the mid-portion of the video the same topmost transverse slit remains the focus. The approach becomes slightly more efficient: fewer preparatory regrips before each pass, and a rhythm of advance, regrasp, and draw-through emerges. The operator continues to aim for perpendicular entries and symmetric exits, keeping the needle curve tightly controlled to maintain uniform bite geometry.

Occasional frames show the needle parked across the incision after a throw has been placed, or the suture looped across while hands reposition, which suggests pauses between passes to plan the next placement. At least once the team tightens an existing running strand centered on another portion of the pad; that activity is brief and appears to be a separate closure already completed earlier on the pad rather than the ongoing work on the superior slit. These brief diversions are noted in the footage but the team promptly returns to the upper slit to continue placing interrupted stitches.

One clear repeatable behaviour is the way the forceps deliver the tissue: a gentle, targeted evert-and-present rather than any broad traction. The operator avoids pulling entire wound margins or applying longitudinal tension; instead each bite is taken from carefully exposed dermis, then the suture is drawn through and the free ends managed. When trimming occurs, it is focused on excess strand length and is followed by immediate reloading of the needle to continue with the next bite.

Late-stage passes, regripping and suture management (420–374 s and 375–449 s)
In the later frames there are multiple examples of definitive needle passages across the superior slit where the needle is driven through, regripped and pulled through to bring the wound edges into close apposition. The hands remain tightly coordinated: the driver works across the slit and the forceps follows the needle tip to maintain an ideal exit point. After several of these late passes the operator draws the suture taut and, in some sequences, tucks the free end to the side to prepare for eventual tying.

Intermixed with these late passes are periods of management of other sutured lines lower on the pad. At one point a tie is clearly completed on a midline segment and the needle driver is laid across that line; that completed knot is on a different incision than the superior slit. This represents a slight inconsistency in the captured footage: while the vast majority of activity is concentrated on the top slit, the team briefly completes or refines closures elsewhere. These brief interruptions do not change the overall pattern of work on the superior slit, but they do provide evidence that multiple repairs exist on the pad and are managed in sequence.

Across the final minutes, the operator’s technique becomes economical. Regrips are smoother, the needle is consistently grasped in positions that favor predictable arcs, and the forceps present edges more efficiently. There is also repeated use of the same left-driver / right-forceps choreography, though occasional reversals occur depending on the field and which hand needs to access the needle tail.

Technique progression and consistency
From start to finish the suturing approach shows clear learning and refinement: early frames emphasize alignment and frequent regrips, while later frames display more confident, continuous passes with fewer setup movements. The core components remain constant: use of a curved needle held at the proximal to mid‑third, a near‑perpendicular bite through the dermis, and precise tissue eversion with fine forceps. Bite depth and margin handling remain conservative and consistent—there is no evidence of crushing forceps or aggressive tissue handling. The operator consistently aims to achieve symmetric dermal purchase and predictable needle exit points.

Knot tying and final closure status
Throughout the captured sequences multiple stitches are passed and suture tails are managed for later tying. Direct documentation of completed knots on the superior slit itself is limited within the available frames: a number of stitches have been passed and suture ends positioned to allow final throws, but most of the footage shows needle passage, suture drawing, regripping and intermittent trimming rather than final knot stacks on that particular top slit. The only clearly completed tie observed in the video is on a midline area of the pad distinct from the superior slit. This means that while the top slit received a methodical series of interrupted passes and the suture limbs were organized after each pass, the video does not consistently capture final knotting of each bite on that slit.

Hand and instrument spatial relationships over time
Across the recording the left hand predominantly functions as the needle driver, occupying positions superior, superior-left or directly left of the incision while advancing the needle. The right hand most commonly holds the forceps, approaching from the opposite side to evert and steady the targeted dermal edge. Hands normally straddle the wound within millimetres to a few centimetres of the margins; instruments cross above the incision to permit a perpendicular needle approach. When the right hand briefly assumes the driver role (seen in some frames), the same principles apply—driver controls arc, forceps present tissue—but the workflow mirrors to accommodate the switch. Whenever scissors are introduced to trim a tail, they approach across the wound axis while the opposite hand controls the strand.

Final condition of the wound
By the end of the captured procedure the superior transverse slit has been repeatedly and systematically addressed with controlled dermal bites. Multiple interrupted passes have been made across the length of the slit; suture material is threaded through the dermis in an organized fashion and suture tails have been managed or trimmed as needed. Edges are uniformly apposed in the areas where passes were completed and suture material is in place, but clear, completed knot stacks on the superior slit are not consistently documented in the frames provided. Overall the repair demonstrates precise needle control, deliberate tissue eversion, and progressive efficiency in technique, with only occasional, brief diversions to manage other sutures on the pad.

Notable limitations observed in the capture
- The footage shows thorough placement of stitches through the superior slit, but it does not consistently show final knot-tying on that same slit; one completed tie visible in the video is applied to a different, central wound.
- Several frames depict short, intermittent handling or trimming of other previously sutured lines; while brief, these events create minor discontinuities in the otherwise continuous focus on the top slit.
- The sequence documents repeated needle regrips and minor changes in handedness; these are part of normal technique optimization but introduce variability in approach that is captured across frames.

Summary
Throughout the video the team works almost exclusively on the short horizontal incision near the top edge of the pad. The approach is methodical: careful loading and orientation of a curved needle, delicate eversion of the dermal edge with forceps, perpendicular full-thickness dermal bites following the needle curvature, regripping to complete needle arcs, and organized suture management including intermittent trimming. Over time the operator’s movements become more efficient and confident, producing uniformly placed passes that closely approximate the wound margins. While final knot-tying on that specific slit is not consistently captured, the suturing steps leading to secure closure are repeatedly and competently performed, yielding a series of well-aligned, tension-managed stitches along the superior incision.
