COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with a deliberate setup at the inferior end of the rightmost incision on a synthetic skin pad. The right hand uses toothed forceps to evert and steady the near (right) edge while the left hand, with a needle driver, presents a curved needle perpendicular to the skin. The first pass is placed near-to-far: the driver follows the arc through the dermis and out the far edge, where the right hand catches the tip and helps deliver the needle. The left regrips on the needle body and draws the suture through, leaving a free tail on the entry side.

With that first deep pass seated, the surgeon immediately prepares the return, more superficial limb of a vertical mattress. The needle is reloaded mid‑curve, again kept perpendicular, and a shorter, near‑surface pass is initiated back toward the near edge. Throughout, the right hand’s forceps present and gently evert the margins; bites are symmetric and a few millimeters from the cut edge.

As the stitch takes shape, the rhythm settles: the needle driver places and then is briefly “parked” while the suture is tensioned along its axis; slack is cleared superiorly so the line doesn’t obscure the target. The mattress configuration becomes evident. The right hand controls tissue, then transitions to managing the suture when needed. The inferior stitch is secured with an instrument tie across the wound: the right hand maintains the standing end with forceps while the left hand, still holding the driver, forms loops and passes the free end through. Throws are seated just adjacent to the wound line without blanching. A loose needle lying on the board is picked up and removed to declutter before tying, then the tie is completed; edges remain approximated with mild eversion.

With the initial stitch down, attention moves superiorly along the same incision. The left hand again carries the needle driver from the left side toward the right wound edge. The next sequence begins by penetrating only the right edge inside‑to‑outside to set up the next pass. The driver releases after exit; the right hand—now with forceps—catches near the swage, straightens the strand, and reorients the needle for re‑entry. The workflow becomes a steady cadence of extract, regrip, reload, and present the next bite, with the right hand consistently lifting the dermal margin 3–5 mm from the edge to achieve eversion while the left hand follows the needle’s curve during entry.

As angles change near the mid‑portion, the hands briefly swap roles for better ergonomics: the right hand takes the driver to place a bite while the left hand handles forceps to present the tissue. Regardless of which hand drives, the needle is held at the mid‑to‑proximal third of its body, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin, and rotated through rather than pushed. Suture management remains disciplined—slack is swept laterally or superiorly to keep the incision clear.

After several passes and tensioning maneuvers, an instrument tie is performed to secure the next stitch in the sequence. The left hand, with the driver, and the right hand, alternating between forceps and direct strand control, seat the knot immediately above the wound. Tail ends are left long; the needle is reloaded promptly for the next movement.

Progressing further superiorly, the surgeon continues the pattern of near‑edge control with forceps and perpendicular needle presentation. A pass at the superior end shows the needle already through the right edge; the driver releases and re‑grasps to reload on the proximal third, then drives across toward the far side while the forceps maintain eversion on the near edge. Slack is managed up and left to keep the field open. Subsequent frames show additional setup bites placed outside‑in on the near edge only, with the stitch line above beginning to look continuous as the passes are advanced in close succession.

Approaching the top corner, the workflow tightens. The forceps are used sparingly on tissue—just enough to present the dermis—while the needle is repeatedly regripped and oriented exactly perpendicular before each entry. The left hand crosses from the superior‑left, the right hand holds the near edge just medial to the bite, and the driver follows the curve cleanly. The suture arcs superiorly across the pad as each new pass is set; instruments avoid crowding the target.

At the superior‑right end, the closure reads as a continuous line of closely spaced bites with good eversion. The surgeon pauses to convert this sequence into a secure finish: the left hand uses the needle driver as a tying instrument, forming loops while the right hand manages the free end. Throws are snugged along the axis of the incision, seating a knot at the top of the run without distorting the skin edges.

With the knot down, the surgeon still refines the corner. The right hand briefly brings in a second driver to assist with a precise regrasp and handoff, then switches back to Adson forceps to fine‑tune needle orientation. The left hand maintains primary control, aligning the grasp at the proximal third with the curve perpendicular to the skin, tip aimed at the right margin. After a short, controlled extraction through the right edge, the needle is set down momentarily on the board to clear the view, then re‑grasped and reloaded for a final, tidy corner bite. The field is kept mostly clear as the left hand re‑enters from the superior‑left toward the right wound margin, ready to place the last pass that nestles the corner and consolidates the eversion.

Across the entire sequence, the flow is measured and consistent: opposing hands work in concert—driver advancing from the left while forceps stabilize from the right; small, perpendicular bites; rotational needle driving; thoughtful suture management; and interspersed, neat instrument ties. The technique evolves from an initial vertical mattress at the inferior end, through a series of methodical passes that approximate the length of the incision, to a controlled finish at the superior corner, all with clear exposure, gentle tissue handling, and steadily maintained eversion.
