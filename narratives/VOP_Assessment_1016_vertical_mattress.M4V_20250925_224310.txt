COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The tray is set with a practice skin pad showing three parallel incisions, and from the first frame onward the operator works at the central vertical incision for the entirety of the recording. The central slit — a straight, full‑thickness synthetic skin incision roughly 2–4 cm long — is the only wound that receives active needle passes, suture advancement, knot formation and trimming throughout the sequence. The narrative below follows the continuous progression of suture placement and management on that central line, integrating the changes in needle handling, tissue manipulation, hand positions and stitch configuration observed across the video.

Initial needle passes and setup (0.0–44.0 s)
Work begins with two hands converging directly over the central incision. A curved swaged needle is grasped in a needle driver held from above; opposing tissue forceps (Adson‑style) in the other hand lift and stabilize the epidermal margin. The operator takes controlled, short arcs with the needle mounted near mid‑shaft in the driver, advancing the tip through one wound edge to exit the opposite side. Bites are deliberately small and placed close to the wound margin, engaging full‑thickness simulated dermis without aggressive traction. The hands are very close (a few centimeters), with the driver approaching from the top/medial direction and forceps from the lateral side; tips converge within millimeters to effect precise apposition. Early frames show completion of a new simple interrupted stitch: the suture loop is pulled through and both limbs are brought together for tying, with the scissors already in reach for later trimming.

Transverse and perpendicular bites; tightening and initial knot work (45.0–104.0 s)
After the initial pass, activity oscillates between placing additional bites and beginning knot formation on the stitches already delivered. In some intervals (45–59 s; 90–104 s), the operator pauses needle insertion and focuses on suture management — holding suture limbs in the driver or with fingers and bringing them together to initiate throws. During these moments the needle may be withdrawn, the driver holding suture material near the wound rather than the needle itself. The non‑driving hand repeatedly manipulates and tensions the free tail, using fingertips or fine forceps to align and maintain approximation. Tissue handling consistently shows atraumatic elevation of the edge with slight eversion, preventing inversion of the epidermal margin. The hands remain adjacent, with one instrument working superior/medial and the other lateral/inferior, enabling immediate handoff between needle delivery and suture tying.

Sequential interrupted placement — technique consolidation (105.0–179.0 s)
Through the next segment the operator establishes a clear rhythm of placing sequential interrupted stitches along the central incision. The needle is habitually grasped near the shaft in the driver and oriented perpendicular‑to‑oblique to the wound edge before being rotated through a controlled arc to the opposite margin. The assistant hand (or non‑dominant hand, depending on the frame) uses tissue forceps or fingertips to evert and stabilize the near edge while the driver advances the needle. Small, superficial‑to‑middermal bites are taken consistently to achieve fine apposition and slight eversion. At 120–134 s a smaller triangular/stellate defect within the central area receives a crossed (X) configuration; here the operator places transfixing bites that produce a crossed loop across the defect prior to tightening — an adaptation to close the small complex defect within the same overall line. Later in this interval (165–179 s) the footage briefly shows mattress‑type passes adjacent to the central wound, indicated by closely spaced loops and small tied constructs; these appear integrated with the interrupted sequence to bolster edge approximation where needed. Throughout, the simulator’s synthetic nature limits assessment of true tissue depth and bleeding response, but the operator’s bites remain consistently shallow‑to‑mid dermal for secure epidermal eversion and apposition.

Mid‑procedure consolidation and knot handling (180.0–269.0 s)
The middle portion of the recording is dominated by alternating cycles of needle passage and knot management. Several frames (180–194 s, 195–209 s, 210–224 s) depict periods where no new needle entry occurs: existing suture limbs are being tightened, multiple throws are formed, and tails are trimmed. When new needle passes are resumed, they are placed between previously tied stitches — a progression from superior to inferior along the same vertical line. Needle handling is steady: the driver often grips the needle near the mid‑shaft or slightly closer to the hub to control curvature and exit angle, and the driver’s approach varies between cranial‑to‑caudal and lateral‑to‑medial trajectories depending on which side of the wound the bite starts. The non‑driving hand alternates between fingertip stabilization and forceps grip, both to maintain edge eversion and to manage suture tails during knot formation. Spatially, the hands remain within a narrow working zone (roughly 1–4 cm), crossing occasionally but typically positioned with the driver superior/medial and the suture‑managing or tissue‑stabilizing hand lateral/inferior.

Addition of proximal and distal stitches; consistent technique (270.0–359.0 s)
As the procedure progresses cranially and caudally along the incision, more interrupted stitches are methodically inserted. Frames between 270–314 s and again 330–359 s show the driver delivering the needle from either the superior direction or slightly oblique angles while the opposing hand lifts the near edge and routes the suture tail. There is a consistent approach to bite depth and placement: small dermal purchases taken 1–3 mm from the wound margin to achieve gentle eversion without bunching. The operator places new stitches sequentially adjacent to existing ones, spacing them evenly and maintaining alignment of the epidermal edges. At points (285–299 s, 300–314 s) the hands are staggered longitudinally — one hand above the working plane and the other below — coordinating needle passage and suture retrieval across the same small working field. The needle is often grasped at mid‑shaft or a little distal to it for more precise tip control, and the driver is rotated through short controlled arcs to avoid excess tissue trauma.

Final passes and completion of interrupted series (360.0–414.0 s)
In the final interval the operator completes the remaining interrupted stitches toward the superior end of the incision. Frames 360–389 s and 390–414 s show the routine repeated — the driver advancing a curved needle through the opposing margin while the other hand stabilizes tissue and tension on suture tails — followed by knot fashioning and trimming. Several frames emphasize finishing tasks: cutting suture tails, withdrawing the needle after a pass, and giving final adaptive tugs on suture limbs to even out tension along the line. Instrument orientation occasionally changes to support knot tying (driver tip close to the superficial surface, needle held near the swage), and scissors are intermittently used to trim tails. At no point are additional incisions worked; all actions are confined to the central slit, preserving continuity of the repair.

Hand positions and spatial relationships during the case
From start to finish the two hands operate in a tightly coordinated, reciprocal pattern. One hand (the needle driver) consistently provides controlled needle delivery, approaching the incision from superior, superior‑lateral or cranial directions depending on the bite location; the other hand serves to evert, stabilize and manage the suture limb, using fingertip pressure, thumb–index forceps or hemostat‑style pickup as needed. Roles occasionally reverse between frames — at times the right hand is the dominant driver and at other moments the left hand delivers the needle — but the relational pattern remains: driver near the shaft, tissue forceps or fingertip stabilizing and tensioning lateral to the entry site. The hands remain within a few centimeters of each other throughout, crossing slightly at needle transfer points but otherwise keeping a short, precise working distance to maintain tactile control and visibility.

Technique consistency and minor variations
Overall, the operator adheres to an interrupted stitch strategy, delivering sequential small dermal bites with consistent eversion and secure approximation of the epidermal margins. Occasional technique variations are observed and appear intentional: a crossed (X) stitch for a small stellate defect, and a couple of mattress‑type passes where more robust approximation was required. These are integrated into the interrupted pattern rather than replacing it. The synthetic training pad limits assessment of true tissue layers, suture purchase depth and knot security under physiologic tension, so some judgments about deep bites versus subcuticular bites are constrained by the model.

Final state of the closure
By the end of the recording the central incision is uniformly approximated along its length with a continuous series of interrupted sutures. Edges are brought into close, edge‑to‑edge contact with slight eversion maintained at the epidermal border. Needle entry and exit points appear evenly spaced and the suture tails have been managed — knots have been formed and tails trimmed in the final frames. No gross gapping or tissue bunching is evident in the synthetic pad; the wound surface shows evenly aligned epidermal margins and multiple secure knots along the length. The instrument field is cleared of active needle passes, scissors and forceps lie idle at the board edge, and the final manipulations consist of giving the last knot a final tensioning and cutting the tail, indicating procedural completion.

Deficiencies and limitations
Throughout the video, the simulated environment restricts assessment of certain clinical details: there is no bleeding or tissue pliability comparable to living tissue, and the synthetic dermis obscures direct confirmation of exact bite depth and whether deeper layer closures (subcutaneous) were performed. A few frames (notably 120–134 s and 180–194 s) show stitch configurations (crossed/X and mattress‑type loops) that differ from the prevailing pattern; these variations appear to be deliberate adaptations to local defects rather than changes in global strategy. Despite the model limitations, the operator demonstrates a consistent, methodical approach: precise needle handling, careful tissue stabilization, sequence‑based placement of interrupted sutures, and organized knot formation and trimming to produce a neat, secure approximation of the central incision at the conclusion of the recording.
