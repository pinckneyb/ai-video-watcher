COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds as a focused, single‑wound closure using the selected simple interrupted technique. The work centers on a short, midline vertical incision in the upper center of the pad. Over the course of the video, the operator establishes an initial stitch, secures it with instrument ties, and then builds a small series of additional simple interrupted sutures that march superiorly along the same line. Throughout, the needle is handled with a needle driver, forceps are used to evert and control the skin edges, and the suture ends are consistently managed to the patient’s right to maintain a clear field. Where a few brief segments appear to depict a horizontal slit, those episodes are best understood as camera orientation or descriptive inconsistencies; the closure remains on the same midline vertical wound with stitches placed perpendicular to the incision, which makes the suture segments themselves appear horizontal. When a true discrepancy appears (for example, a distinct horizontal laceration shown with multiple prior stitches), it likely reflects a brief cutaway or documentation inconsistency; nonetheless, the continuity of the technique and the subsequent return to the same central vertical line confirm that the procedure’s active closure is that single midline vertical incision.

The session begins with a stitch being secured on a small vertical wound, with the driver and forceps opposed across the line. The left hand controls the needle driver directly over the wound while the right hand uses Adson forceps to hold the free end and stabilize the tissue. The needle is grasped securely near its proximal third, perpendicular to the pad, the arc is controlled above the wound, and immediately afterward the driver transitions to instrument ties over the incision. The synthetic edges are gently elevated and aligned, and an initial knot is thrown and seated evenly over the wound. Tension is distributed in opposing directions, keeping the approximated edges aligned without crushing the tissue.

Almost immediately, the camera shifts to the upper center where the midline vertical incision that will occupy the remainder of the procedure is engaged. Here, a short transverse slit adjacent to the upper center is briefly used for a pass, but the assault on the main closure line becomes clear within the next sequence, and subsequent actions stay centered on the midline vertical wound. The technique is consistent: the needle is grasped at the proximal third by the driver, the right hand performs a forehand pass from the patient’s right toward the left across the wound, and the left hand with forceps presents and everts the dermal edge to meet the needle. After the pass, tension is applied to pull the suture through while protecting the tissue, and the driver is repurposed as the post for instrument ties. These ties are formed by wrapping the long strand around the driver, then grasping and pulling the short end through. The throws are alternated and seated squarely down onto the wound.

With the first central stitch in place at the upper‑center vertical slit, the video shows multiple sequences of knot tying over the same point. The left hand often acts as the post—either with forceps holding the standing part or with the driver parked across the knot line—while the right hand wraps, grasps, and sets throws. The needle itself remains parked safely on the free strand during tying, kept to the right side of the field. The operator alternates throws and adjusts lateral tension to snug each knot flush against the skin surface, creating slight, appropriate puckering that indicates the edges are coming together. In this early phase, no additional passes are made; the focus is on perfecting and locking the instrument tie on the initial stitch.

As the closure progresses, the operative focus stays on the same midline vertical wound. The right hand usually holds the needle driver slightly superior‑right of the incision, while the left hand with Adsons approaches from the inferior‑left. The curvature of the needle is preserved as it is advanced in a controlled arc, entering a few millimeters from the wound edge, following through the dermal layer, and exiting symmetrically on the far side. The driver regrips the needle midway if needed to complete the arc and retrieve it cleanly. Forceps provide gentle eversion at both the entry and exit points, and the bites are matched for depth and distance from the margin to produce even approximation. The suture is then pulled through and the long end is drawn laterally to the patient’s right before the next series of instrument throws is tied down. The technique alternates in a steady rhythm—place, pull through, regrip, tension, tie—building the interrupted series superiorly along the same midline.

Several sequences show knot tying in detail. In one, the left hand stabilizes the short standing end vertically over the wound while the right hand, with the driver, wraps and retrieves the short end to form sequential throws. Each throw is seated by pulling laterally and then down, keeping the knot centered over the wound and preventing slippage. The driver is sometimes parked holding the needle but away from tissue during these ties, minimizing risk of inadvertent puncture. Consistency is apparent: throws are alternated to lock the knot, and tension is distributed evenly so that the wound edges meet flush without strangulation. The suture tails are cut only after the knot is fully seated, and the cut is close to the knot but not too short, leaving clean, short tails.

As the series of simple interrupted sutures accumulates, the operator begins advancing slightly superior to the previous knot line. Several sequences demonstrate placing a fresh pass just above the prior stitch, again with the right hand on the driver and the left hand handling eversion and retrieval. Each new stitch is placed perpendicular to the wound so that, visually, the suture itself lies horizontally across the vertical incision—an expected appearance that likely underlies the occasional description of a “horizontal” element. Traction is gentle and controlled, used primarily to draw the edges together and check the symmetry and depth of bites.

In the middle of the procedure, the operator pauses from placing new bites to organize suture material. The curved needle is controlled in the driver while the free suture end is managed with the opposite hand. At one point, both hands collaborate to open a new suture packet near the upper‑right of the field, anticipating continuation of the same closure. The existing stitches, already approximating the central portion of the wound, are left undisturbed during this preparation. The strand is kept to the right to avoid entanglement with the field, and the needle driver remains parallel to the wound axis.

After resuming, the operator again returns immediately to the superior portion of the same midline incision. A fresh bite is planned and taken with the needle grasped two‑thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and advanced in a short, symmetric arc. The left hand’s forceps lift the edge to set entry depth and support eversion, and the needle exits the far side at a matching point. The suture is drawn through and an instrument tie is thrown and seated above the existing three central knots. Tension is adjusted laterally to set the stitch without over‑tightening, preserving perfusion and edge eversion. As this stitch is finalized, the knot is stabilized and the tails are trimmed.

A dedicated trimming sequence follows, focusing on the superior‑most stitch. The right hand secures the suture with the needle holder just right/superior to the knot, maintaining gentle tension, while the left hand brings in scissors to cut the tails. The cut is performed close to the knot with careful control; forceps stabilize the area to avoid lifting the wound edge itself. No new tissue penetration occurs during trimming, and the previously placed row remains aligned and approximated.

The subsequent placement reinforces the same pattern: the needle is reloaded by the driver at the proximal third to the mid‑body, presented perpendicular to the wound, and driven in an arc across the midline incision, with regripping as needed to maintain optimal needle curvature and entry angle. The left hand provides counter‑traction and precise eversion on the near edge, then crosses to support the exit. The stitch is tied with multiple instrument throws, alternated for locking security, and seated directly over the incision. As the work advances, the stitches form a tidy cluster in the upper‑middle portion of the line, with evenly spaced knots and short, neat tails.

At one point, a segment shows a lateral horizontal laceration being sutured with multiple existing stitches in line; a new stitch is placed and tails trimmed. Given the immediate return in the next segment to the superior portion of the midline vertical wound—again with three central knots already present and a new throw being tied just above them—and the consistent hand positions and strand management, the most coherent interpretation is a brief documentation inconsistency or cutaway. The technique applied is identical: small, symmetric bites with the needle perpendicular to the skin, forceps‑assisted eversion, tensioning of the long end to the right, and instrument ties seated squarely over the wound. There is no sustained departure from the midline vertical closure, and all subsequent frames continue the series along that same line.

As the last active suturing sequences conclude, the operator finishes a superior stitch and trims its ends. The field then quiets. In the final frames, no hands or instruments are actively engaged over the wound. The curved needle with suture attached rests on the pad to the patient’s right, with the curve facing inward toward the pad—a pause in the work. The previously placed simple interrupted stitches are visible as a row perpendicular to the incision in the upper‑middle segment. The tails are cut short and neat, and the knots sit centrally over each bridge of suture. The superior and central portions are well approximated with slight, appropriate puckering around the knots; the inferior portion of the midline incision remains less secured, showing a residual gap relative to the already sutured segment, indicating the closure is only partially completed at the time the clip ends.

Technique across the session is consistent with the selected simple interrupted method:

- Needle handling is methodical: grasped at the proximal third to mid‑body, oriented perpendicular to the skin, advanced in a controlled arc, and regripped when necessary to preserve curvature and trajectory.
- Tissue handling preserves edge integrity: forceps are used to gently lift and evert margins, with symmetric, shallow bites placed equidistant from the wound edge to achieve even approximation.
- Suture management is tidy: the long end is routinely directed to the patient’s right, kept clear of the field during placement and tying, and the needle is parked safely on the strand when not actively passing.
- Knot tying uses classic instrument throws: the driver serves as the post, throws are alternated to lock, and knots are seated directly on the wound with balanced opposing tension. Where trimming is shown, tails are cut close and clean after the knot is fully set.

A few minor deficiencies are visible and worth noting without detracting from the continuity of the chosen technique. During preparation and at the final pause, the needle rests on the pad to the side of the field rather than being stowed in a neutral zone or returned to its packet; while the sharp is not actively threatening tissue in these frames, maintaining control of sharps is a best practice. In some early segments, edge eversion is minimal during tying; later segments correct this with more consistent use of forceps to present the dermal edges. Additionally, a brief sequence appears to depict a separate horizontal laceration; however, given the immediate return to and continuation of the midline vertical closure, this is most likely a documentation or perspective inconsistency. The operator’s technique, hand dominance, instrument use, and suture management remain continuous with the main closure throughout.

By the end of the clip, the midline vertical incision in the upper center of the pad is partially closed with a tidy cluster of simple interrupted sutures spanning the upper‑middle portion. Knots are square and centered, tails are trimmed short, and the approximated segments display slight, appropriate edge eversion. The inferior segment remains open and would be the next target for additional simple interrupted stitches were the procedure to continue. The suture and needle lie to the right, indicating a pause in the workflow rather than a completed full‑length closure. Overall, the narrative shows a careful, stepwise application of simple interrupted technique—placing individual, perpendicular stitches across a single midline vertical incision, tying and trimming each before proceeding to the next—building orderly progress toward complete skin approximation.
