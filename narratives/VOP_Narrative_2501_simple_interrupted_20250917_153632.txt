COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The entire sequence documents a single skin-pad wound closure carried out with simple interrupted sutures along the vertical incision positioned closest to the pad’s right border. The work begins low on this right-hand slit and then proceeds methodically up the wound toward its superior end. Across the case, the operator alternates between using tissue forceps and fingertips for edge control, and frequently parks the needle while tying instrument knots. Knot tails are consistently seated to the right of the wound, and trimming occurs intermittently as the series advances. The two more medial slits remain unused, their edges untouched, except for one brief detour early in the recording that does not result in any placed or retained stitch away from the primary wound.

The closure opens with a fresh pass on the distal portion of the right-sided slit. The needle is loaded about two-thirds from the tip in a needle driver, brought perpendicular to the pad, and advanced in a controlled arc across the gap. The non-dominant hand uses forceps to gently lift and evert the near wound edge, presenting an even dermal bite without crushing the tissue. After the needle pierces the everted side, it is guided onward toward the opposite margin. The suture strand trails leftward and is managed to stay clear of the wound line. This first maneuver sets the depth, direction, and spacing pattern that will be repeated: perpendicular entry, smooth rotational drive through the tissue, and careful retrieval across the slit with attention to edge eversion and symmetry. No knot is tied in this very first glimpse, but the technique is clearly established.

Immediately thereafter, there is a brief interlude in which the camera and hands appear centered over the middle of the pad, with a pass initiated on the central slit. Forceps and the needle driver align over that line and a right-to-left arc is begun. However, no knots are thrown there, no lines are developed, and this neighboring incision is never revisited in a way that contributes to closure. The remainder of the procedure returns to and remains on the rightmost slit, which is the single wound that is actually being closed throughout. This momentary drift reads as a positioning or practice pass rather than a second active wound.

Back at the right-hand incision, the first completed simple interrupted stitch is placed across the lower half of the slit. The needle is advanced and extracted cleanly, slack is pulled through, and the edges are brought into apposition. The operator forms an instrument tie: the driver wraps, the short end is grasped, and the throw is seated carefully without rolling the wound edges. Subsequent throws follow to secure the knot, and the needle is repositioned for continuing work along the same line. The hands work in opposition—driver hand crossing the slit to follow the arc, while the assisting hand steadies the wound margin and manages the free strand. With this, the pattern of “place a bite, tie, and move proximally” is underway.

A second pass is initiated slightly higher on the same slit. In one sequence the driver is in the left hand and the right hand manages the strand with fingers rather than forceps. The needle is still grasped near its proximal third, oriented perpendicular to the surface, and rolled through in a forehand motion. The assisting hand presses gently on the edge for countertraction and then pulls the thread through to clear slack, maintaining visualization and preventing suture drag. Another pass is staged from a superior-right approach: the needle tip is positioned to enter the right margin at appropriate distance from the cut edge while the left hand stabilizes tissue below and right of the entry site. Again, the drive is perpendicular, rotation is controlled, and the pass is retrieved across the wound without undue torque.

As the early lower and mid-portion stitches accumulate, the operator alternates between using forceps and using fingertips to stabilize tissue and manage the suture. In one stretch the assistant hand does not use pickups at all; instead it tensions the strand to approximate the edges while the driver aligns the needle for entry. In another, Adson forceps return to provide fine eversion at the right lip while the needle arcs across and exits through the contralateral side. The technique is consistent: maintain edge eversion, take symmetric bites, keep needle movement in the plane of its curvature, and avoid crossing the suture over the wound unless forming and seating knots.

The transitions into knot tying show disciplined instrument handling. Often the needle is parked on the strand, out of the tissue and slightly away from the operative site, while the driver performs instrument ties. The driver alternately grasps the short end to deliver it through loops; throws are tightened adjacent to the previous knot stack. At times the left hand briefly leaves the field, then returns to present the short tail or to stabilize the knot while the right hand cinches down successive throws. The knot is typically seated just to the right of the incision, and the line is kept parallel to the slit to avoid sawing across the edge.

Once a few stitches are secure in the lower-to-mid segment, trimming begins. Scissors enter from the upper right, aligned parallel to the wound, to cut the tails near the knot stack without nicking the skin or loosening the throws. This pattern—place and secure a stitch, then trim tails—repeats periodically as the closure marches superiorly. The suture tails, when cut, remain consistently on the right side of the wound, reinforcing the visual orientation for subsequent passes.

Progressing up the incision, new bites are placed immediately proximal to existing knots. In several sequences the forceps lift the right edge to present the bite site, then release as the needle passes. The driver’s jaws hold the needle at the proximal third to midpoint, providing control and allowing an easy regrip if needed. The arc remains perpendicular to the skin, with the tip directed leftward across the slit. Entry points are spaced to maintain even approximation without puckering. After passage, the needle is passed off or regripped, and the suture is drawn through smoothly, minimizing drag on the wound margins.

As the row lengthens, the operator’s hand positions evolve for access. The driver hand commonly sits superior-right of the wound, angling the tip toward the left edge; the assisting hand is inferior-right, providing countertraction or managing the thread. When necessary, the pad is rotated slightly to improve ergonomics; once a stitch is tied, the pad is returned to its original orientation and the work continues along the same line. This micro-adjustment is particularly evident in the upper half of the incision, where room becomes tighter near the top of the pad and existing knot stacks, yet the suture line remains straight and parallel to the slit.

In the mid-to-upper portion, bites and ties continue with the same cadence. The needle is frequently loaded at the proximal third, with the jaws perpendicular to the curve; the driver supinates and pronates to follow the needle’s arc across the tissue. The assistant occasionally tensions the free strand to keep it out of the way, and occasionally uses forceps to assist with eversion as the needle enters or exits. Ties are executed with alternating direction to lock the stitch; throws are cinched firmly but not overly tight, maintaining gentle edge eversion and avoiding blanching. At intervals, scissors return to trim tails flush with the knot while the other hand holds light tension to prevent loosening.

Near the upper third, the sequences show several passes and ties clustered around the next superior bite. The right edge is briefly lifted and everted to accept the needle; once through, the suture is brought across, slack is cleared, and the edges fall together with the familiar mild eversion. The needle is then parked, and the series of instrument ties is performed—multiple throws seated adjacent to the previous knots. The hand choreography is smooth: the driver secures the short end through the loops, hands reset, and the next throw is delivered with good control. The needle, still attached to the long end, is kept away from the tissue surface during tying to prevent accidental stabs or suture catching.

As the last few superior bites are taken, the operative field becomes a narrow channel bordered by previously placed stitches. The driver continues to approach from the right side, aiming leftward, and the bite spacing remains consistent. One sequence shows a pass placed just superior to existing knots, the strand drawn through, but tying deferred momentarily. In the next sequences, the operator returns to snug and secure that stitch, then trims the tails. The scissors approach parallel to the incision; the non-dominant hand stabilizes the strand lightly as the cut is made, leaving a neat, compact knot stack at the top end of the closure.

Throughout, the suture thread is conscientiously managed. The free limb is usually directed laterally to the right, away from the wound line; during tying, the strand is raised slightly above the field to visualize loop formation and prevent tangling with instruments. When the operator needs to reposition, both hands briefly leave the frame and re-enter on the right; the needle is reloaded for the next pass without any extraneous handling of other incisions.

By the time the sequence reaches its final moments, the right-sided wound is spanned by a short series of evenly spaced simple interrupted stitches. The edges are approximated in good alignment with mild eversion and no inversion. Knot stacks sit consistently on the right side, with trimmed tails where scissors have been used; a few knots remain untrimmed temporarily prior to final cuts in the subsequent steps. The two central slits remain open and undisturbed, reinforcing that all active closure work has been concentrated on the rightmost incision alone. There is a brief static view at the end: no hands or instruments are present, and the wound edges along the right-side incision are held together by several completed stitches, appearing generally well approximated with only a trace of residual gapping near the inferior-most stitch—minor and expected before any post-closure dressing or additional inferior coverage.

In summary, the procedure is a straightforward, well-controlled simple interrupted skin closure of the rightmost vertical incision on a multi-slit pad. It begins with a first pass in the lower third, then proceeds in a cephalad direction, one stitch at a time: pass, draw through, tie with instrument throws, and trim tails at intervals. Needle handling remains consistent—grasped at the proximal third to mid-needle, kept perpendicular to the skin, and advanced with rotational wrist motion. Tissue handling emphasizes gentle eversion using forceps when needed and fingertip stabilization when forceps are omitted. Spatially, the driver and assisting hand straddle the wound, shifting slightly for ergonomics but always staying close and parallel to the incision. With each stitch placed and secured, the wound edges come together in orderly fashion. The closure concludes near the superior end with final tightening and trimming, leaving a neat row of simple interrupted knots along the right margin and a well-approximated right-hand slit, while the nearby central incisions remain untouched from start to finish apart from a fleeting, non-contributory excursion early in the recording.
