COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a synthetic skin practice pad that bears three parallel linear incisions. The operator focuses attention along the vertical incision located roughly one-third from the left edge of the pad (the middle-left of the three vertical wounds). Throughout the recording the operator consistently returns to and works along this same vertical incision, advancing closure sequentially along its superior–inferior axis while the other incisions sit either already closed or passively present in the field.

Initial approach and setup
At the outset the worksite is prepared and instruments are in hand: a curved suture needle mounted on suture material is grasped in a needle driver in the dominant hand while fine toothed tissue forceps (Adson-style) are used in the non-dominant hand to manipulate and evert the wound edges. The camera field occasionally captures other wounds on the pad with completed interrupted sutures, but the operator’s hands, instrument orientation and the suture material consistently converge on the middle-left incision. Hands remain gloved and positioned close to the wound, typically within 1–4 cm of the incision so that a tight working triangle is formed between the driver, the forceps and the wound margin for precise needle control.

Needle control and bite technique
Throughout the case the operator uses a small curved needle held in the needle driver with a mid‑shaft to slightly distal grip (often described in the frames as mid-to-distal or near the shaft). This grip gives precise control for short, controlled arcs as the needle is rotated through the tissue. The needle is oriented so the tip is driven nearly perpendicular or oblique to the wound edge for a controlled, predictable bite. The typical trajectory is an arc across the wound from one margin to the other; depending on the moment in the sequence the driver approaches from a slightly lateral or superior orientation, but the arc and the relative perpendicular bite remain constant.

The non-dominant hand uses forceps to grasp and evert the near wound edge prior to passage, presenting dermis for an accurate epidermal-to-epidermal approximation. The forceps hold the margin gently but firmly, lifting it slightly to create slight eversion of the epidermal edge at the point of the bite. Bites are shallow to mid-dermal in depth on the skin analog—no deep fascial or buried layer bites are employed; all closure is through the dermal/epidermal analog consistent with simple interrupted skin closure. The operator manages suture length with the non-dominant hand or gloved fingers as needed, making sure loops are controlled and ready for tying.

Sequential placement pattern
Work progresses in a methodical, sequential fashion along the length of the incision. The operator takes a new bite at the superior segment and then proceeds sequentially toward the inferior segment of the same linear wound, or in some sequences advances from an open superior segment toward already-tied inferior sutures. Each pass is executed with the same basic sequence: forceps elevate and evert the near edge; the needle driver advances the curved needle through the opposing edge in a short arc; the suture is drawn through so a loop forms across the wound; the operator then prepares to tie and secure the suture.

Spacing and tissue approximation are consistent throughout. Bites are placed at even intervals, producing interrupted stitches that sit close to one another without wide undermining or excessive amounts of tissue captured. The edges are approximated with slight, controlled eversion beneath each knot so that the epidermal surfaces meet at the apex. Tension applied to each stitch is moderated—enough to bring the margins together cleanly but not enough to flatten or invert them. The overall visual effect is a row of small, evenly spaced interrupted stitches producing a stretched but well-aligned closure.

Knot and tail management
After each pass the operator moves efficiently to secure the stitch. The needle driver and forceps come together over the wound in a tying motion; because the field is a synthetic practice pad, the same tying motion is used repeatedly and quickly. Suture tails are left intentionally short after knotting in later stages of the sequence—short tails protrude from each knot, consistent with neat interrupted technique. In earlier frames the operator sometimes manages longer tails when pulling the suture through prior to knotting, and those tails are subsequently shortened. Occasionally scissors or instrument tips come briefly into view as the operator prepares to trim tails, though the detailed scissor strokes are not always clearly visualized because of camera distance or brief changes in the field of view.

Hand positions and their evolution
At the start of the sequence hands are positioned roughly 1–3 cm apart over the wound, forming a tight V-shaped approach. The needle driver generally approaches from the operator’s right or lateral side while the forceps occupy a slightly medial or cephalad position. This configuration persists throughout the closure: the driver applies forward/back rotation to the needle while the forceps counter-traction and eversion on the opposite side maintain edge alignment.

As the sequence continues and more stitches are placed, instruments may shift slightly along the axis of the wound. For example, when working at the superior pole the operator’s hands orient slightly more cephalad; when attention moves inferiorly the hands slide down the incision while maintaining the same relative relationship to one another. At times, especially during knot-tying or suture management, one hand temporarily controls suture tails while the other performs a tying motion; the roles alternate smoothly and predictably. The hand positions remain close, precise and deliberately coordinated throughout—there is no large-scale reorientation or awkward reach; the workflow remains compact and efficient.

Instrument details and small variations
A gold-handled needle driver is visible in several frames indicating a standard needle driver with fine control is used. The forceps are described as Adson-style toothed forceps in many observations, suitable for grasping and everting the synthetic dermal edge. The grip on the needle is consistent—mid-shaft to body of the curve—allowing controlled rotation rather than radical regripping. Needle orientations sometimes vary by a few degrees depending on the approach angle, but the principle of a perpendicular-to-curve bite is maintained.

Technique consistency and development
From the first active passes through the end, the operator consistently employs simple interrupted sutures to close the linear defect—short, controlled bites, eversion of the edges and knotting of each stitch. There is no evidence of a transition into a continuous running pattern, mattress sutures, or buried deep-layer closure. Over time, the operator’s technique becomes more ordered and compact: early passes may show slightly longer suture tails and a little more visible manipulation of suture material, while later passes show shorter, tidier tails and tighter, more consistent knots. This reflects an expected refinement in hand-to-hand coordination as the operator proceeds along the line.

There is an emphasis on symmetry: each stitch mirrors the previous one in orientation and bite depth, producing a uniform row. As additional stitches are placed, minor crowding is noted near previously tied knots, so instrument approach is adjusted slightly to maintain clean bites—operator movements become smaller, more controlled and adapted to the limited space adjacent to completed sutures.

Tissue handling and interaction
Tissue handling is gentle and appropriate for a skin closure practice model. The forceps lift the epidermal margin sufficiently to present the dermis without crushing the tissue. Slight eversion is actively achieved before knot tightening, which is a standard approach to ensure the epidermal edges do not invert when the suture is secured. There is no visible excessive tension that would indicate strangulation of tissue; instead tensioning is moderated to approximate without blanching the pad material.

Throughout the procedure the operator takes shallow-to-mid dermal bites—sufficient to achieve security in a skin substitute but not so deep as to simulate fascial closure. This is consistent with the intended exercise of practicing precise skin edge approximation.

Pauses, camera limitations and completion signs
There are intermittent frames in which no hands or instruments are visible and the pad with its row of sutures is shown from a distance. These frames commonly depict the middle-left incision in a state with multiple interrupted stitches already in place and short tails protruding from each knot. In those segments the absence of visible hands suggests either a brief pause, reorientation of the camera, or a moment between passes. Deficiencies in the footage are present—an overhead and somewhat distant camera angle in several segments partially obscures fine details such as the exact bite depth and minute needle tip behavior. On a few occasions the operator’s hands and instruments are off-screen, which limits assessment of needle grip angle and the very last moments of knot tightening. Nonetheless, the continuity of the technique and the progression of stitches along the same incision are clear across the recording.

Spatial relationships and working ergonomics
Across the timeline the spatial relationships among instruments, hands and the wound remain stable: the needle driver and forceps converge over the wound in a working triangle; they cross lightly over the incision as required; and the non-dominant hand consistently stabilizes the tissue while the dominant hand executes the needle arc. When the operator needs to access slightly crowded areas near previously placed stitches, instrument approach becomes more vertical and compact, but the fundamental geometry of oppositional control—driver versus forceps—remains unchanged.

Final configuration and wound appearance
By the final frames the middle-left incision is neatly approximated along its length with a series of evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures. Each knot produces a small amount of eversion under the knot, resulting in a tidy, slightly raised line of closure. Short suture tails protrude from the knots, trimmed to a modest length, and the gaps between stitches are minimal, indicating consistent spacing. The overall wound line appears well-closed: opposing edges are closely approximated along the entire repaired tract with no obvious gapping, excessive tension, or inversion. Adjacent incisions on the pad also show completed interrupted closures, confirming that the operator repeatedly practiced the same interrupted technique across multiple sites on the model.

Summary impression
In summary, the operator performs a methodical, consistent sequence of simple interrupted skin sutures along the middle-left vertical incision. The technique is characterized by mid‑shaft needle driver grips handling a curved needle in short, controlled arcs; Adson-style forceps used to evert and stabilize the near edge; shallow-to-mid dermal bites that yield slight eversion of epidermal margins; disciplined, compact hand positions maintained within a few centimeters of the wound; and orderly progression of evenly spaced interrupted stitches with neat knot and tail management. Camera distance and occasional frames lacking hands obscure a few fine technical details, but the procedural continuity, refinement of hand coordination, and final neatly approximated linear closure are clearly evident.
