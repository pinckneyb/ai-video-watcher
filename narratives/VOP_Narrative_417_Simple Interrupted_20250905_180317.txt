COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video follows a methodical series of simple‑interrupted closures on a synthetic skin pad, showing a consistent rhythm of load, bite, pull‑through, instrument tie, and trim, repeated across different lacerations as the operator works left‑to‑right and inferior‑to‑superior across the field.

It opens with setup and first bite preparation at the lower central incision. The right hand loads and fine‑tunes the needle in the driver for a perpendicular, 90‑degree approach while the left hand elevates the near edge with pickups to create eversion and define the entry point. Between these opening frames and the next sequence, the needle is driven and the suture passed across the horizontal inferior wound, then brought out to the right so the needle can be parked safely off the field.

With the suture now traversing the wound, the focus shifts entirely to tying. The right hand manages the long limb and delivers it to the left‑hand needle driver, which acts as the post for instrument ties. Throws are formed centrally over the incision, alternating direction to square the knot while maintaining gentle, balanced tension that holds approximation without blanching the edges. The driver repeatedly opens and regrips the short end as each loop is laid down and pulled through. As the knot seats, the right hand keeps steady, downward‑and‑lateral tension to snug it directly over the wound. A brief return of the cutting instrument from the superior‑left allows the tails to be trimmed, leaving a single, neat knot at the lower‑left/inferior bite and a clear field.

The operator then transitions to a nearby short vertical laceration in the lower‑left quadrant. The right hand regrips the needle already in situ and completes the pull‑through of an existing pass, keeping the needle orientation orthogonal as it exits, then releasing and regrasping as needed to draw the strand cleanly out to the right. With the pass completed, the needle is again kept out of the tying zone while the left‑hand driver becomes the post. The right hand controls the free limb, sweeping it laterally to clear the field between throws. Successive instrument ties are placed a few millimeters above the skin, alternating direction to flatten the knot. After the final throw, both instruments withdraw, revealing a centered knot with tails oriented inferolaterally and the wound edges evenly apposed.

Next, attention moves to a lower‑left corner or angled laceration. The right hand briefly uses pickups to stabilize and evert the edge, while the needle driver—held initially from the left—advances the needle through the marked bite with an orthogonal trajectory. Once the needle traverses, the right hand pulls the suture laterally to the right to clear the operative view. The tying sequence resumes: the left hand maintains the driver near the wound as the right hand presents and tensions the free end. The driver alternately grasps and releases the tail to deliver successive throws. At one point, a hemostat tags a tail to hold tension and prevent loosening while additional throws are laid, after which it’s removed. The knot finishes centered and secure, with no excess tissue distortion.

The workflow then shifts to the central‑left vertical incision, where several simple‑interrupted stitches already sit. After a brief pause with the field empty, the right hand re‑enters holding a loaded needle while the left hand positions pickups to tent the near edge. The needle is reoriented precisely to a 90‑degree approach; instruments cross above the wound in a controlled working triangle. Between these frames and the next sequence, the needle penetrates and exits across the incision. The right hand then uses the driver to grasp the needle/suture on the far side and completes the pull‑through, after which the driver is repurposed as the tying post. The long limb lies to the right, the short limb to the left.

Tying proceeds with a smooth, practiced cadence. The left hand wraps and delivers the free end around the stationary driver; the right hand lifts the post slightly to seat each throw, then the hands alternate traction across the incision line to set the knot while keeping the edges apposed. The needle remains parked off to the right throughout tying to minimize clutter and risk. Additional throws follow, placed just above the skin without pinning the tissue. The right hand occasionally steps in to re‑tension the long limb laterally, then returns to pass the tail for the next throw. In the final moments, the right hand provides a last controlled tension on the free strand to snug the knot; the left‑hand driver, held vertically just left and slightly superior to the wound, remains steady as the knot settles directly over the stitch line. Both hands withdraw, leaving a clean field with approximated edges and a tidy series of simple interrupted knots along the left incision.

Across the entire video, the hand positions and techniques evolve predictably with each phase:
- During needle work, the right hand prioritizes precise needle orientation and pull‑through, while the left hand uses pickups for controlled eversion only when needed.
- During tying, the needle is consistently kept away from the wound, the left‑hand driver becomes the post, and the right hand manages the free limb to form alternating instrument throws.
- Instrument traffic is deliberate: tools are parked at the field margins when idle, hands avoid crossing under one another, and tension is applied symmetrically to maintain apposition without crushing.

The overall flow is unhurried and repetitive in a reassuring way: align and take the bite, retrieve and clear the needle, convert seamlessly into instrument ties with alternating throws, then secure and trim before moving to the next defect. The result is a series of well‑seated, square knots over neatly approximated wound edges, achieved with minimal tissue handling and a smooth, economical rhythm.
