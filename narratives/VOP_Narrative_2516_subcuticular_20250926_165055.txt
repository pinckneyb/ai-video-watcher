COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows the simple interrupted suturing approach as designated in the system. From the first frames through the end of the recording the operator concentrates on the same vertical skin defect located slightly left of the pad center—a short linear incision on the synthetic skin simulator that is worked sequentially along its length. Over the course of the video the incision is closed by a repeated, deliberate cycle of needle positioning, tissue stabilization with fine forceps, transcutaneous needle passes and suture management culminating in knot tying and tail trimming. The narrative below reconstructs that continuous process in chronological order, integrating instrument grips, tissue handling, suture behavior and the evolving relationships of hands and tools to the wound.

Initial approach and first passes (0.0–44.0 s)
At the outset the operator positions two gloved hands to bracket the central vertical slit. One hand holds a needle driver while the other uses Adson-style tissue forceps to evert and stabilize the near edge. The needle—a curved swaged suture on a monofilament— is grasped in the needle driver usually around the mid‑shaft so the curve can be driven through a shallow dermal bite. The forceps lift the edge to present dermis and the driver advances the needle in a controlled arc from one side of the incision to the other. Bites are taken superficially, through epidermal/upper dermal tissue, with attention to edge eversion. The suture is pulled through to create a loop spanning the wound; tension is controlled manually or with the forceps in preparation for knot tying. Hands sit close to the wound (approximately 1–4 cm apart) to maintain precise control; the needle trajectory is generally perpendicular-to-oblique to the skin surface.

As the first stitches are placed, the operator repeatedly uses the same hand pairing and instrument orientation: needle driver delivering the arc, forceps presenting and opposing. Instruments often cross near the wound axis, with tips within a few centimeters of one another to allow secure needle transfer and delicate manipulation of tissue. Early passes show consistent shallow bites aimed to evert and align the skin edges without excess puckering.

Sequential placement and technique refinement (45.0–134.0 s)
Following the initial introduction of suture material, the operator continues adding interrupted stitches along the vertical slit. Each cycle begins with edge presentation by the forceps, then controlled rotation of the curved needle through the opposite edge by the needle driver. Grip of the needle varies slightly across passes—sometimes the driver grips closer to the distal third, other times nearer the mid‑shaft—but the intention remains the same: use the curvature to trace a smooth arc that captures dermal tissue and exits near the opposing epidermal margin.

Throughout this middle period, the hands maintain a consistent oppositional pattern: one hand (commonly the dominant hand) manages the driver and the needle while the other stabilizes tissue and the free suture limb. Operators repeatedly elevate the far edge to improve bite depth and to evert the skin, capturing dermis to promote good approximation. The suture loops are pulled through and prepared for tying; in several frames the non-dominant hand or a second instrument (hemostat/scissors) is introduced to control the suture tail while the primary hand forms and secures the knot. Tissue handling remains atraumatic overall—there is minimal crushing or overhandling—and bites are intentionally superficial rather than involving deeper subcutaneous layers.

Mid‑procedure transitions and local focus (135.0–224.0 s)
As the sequence progresses, attention focuses on adjacent portions of the same vertical wound. The operator advances along the incision, placing stitches adjacent to previously tied bites. Passage patterns are consistent: needle approaches from one side, transfixes tissue in a controlled arc while forceps maintain eversion, and the suture is drawn through to form a loop spanning the defect. Instrument positioning shows small but notable shifts: sometimes the needle driver approaches from an inferior-lateral direction, other times from a superior or medial approach depending on the local orientation of the bite being taken. The opposing hand mirrors these shifts, repositioning the forceps to present the ideal bite site.

The operator occasionally changes grip for specific maneuvers—grasping the needle nearer the hub for stronger control when passing through slightly firmer regions of the simulator, or moving to a mid-curve grip when needing smoother rotation. These minor adjustments do not alter the underlying technique; they reflect normal ergonomic adaptation as new stitches are added in slightly different wound locations. The suture threads are routinely tensioned and knotted, with the knot-tying step sometimes aided by a second instrument (hemostat) to secure and dress the knot before trimming.

Frequent frames depict the sequence of passing, externalizing the needle and thread, adjusting tension, tying a surgeon’s knot or square knots, and trimming tails. Suture management is pragmatic: the free limbs are looped away from the field or clamped with a hemostat during knot formation. Forceps continue to underpin each bite, ensuring good eversion and alignment throughout.

Close-in work and manual handling (225.0–304.0 s)
During the mid-to-late procedure the operator’s hands move increasingly close to the wound for fine control. At times only a single hand is clearly manipulating the suture tails with fingertips, suggesting the operator alternates between instrument- and finger-based suture handling when securing knots or evaluating approximation. The needle driver and tissue forceps remain within a narrow working envelope (often 1–3 cm apart) so that needle exchanges and transfers are efficient. There are moments when a new stitch is passed and the operator immediately draws the suture into the palm to prepare for knotting—this hand-centered activity reduces instrument exchanges and allows rapid knot formation.

Needle passes remain superficially oriented, with an ongoing goal of edge eversion. The operator continues to place stitches adjacent to previously completed bites so that the slit is closed in a serial fashion. Spatially, the operator tends to work from one segment of the incision to the next—moving cranially or caudally as necessary—while maintaining consistent dermal capture and alignment. The suture loops remain parallel and evenly spaced, and the knots are placed at the lateral edges, slightly off the wound line, so that the central tissue apposition is unobstructed.

Late-stage polishing and completion (305.0–360.0 s)
In the final phases, the suturing pattern is consolidated and the operator focuses on finishing the remaining open segments and tidying suture tails. Instrument exchanges occur: scissors or a hemostat are introduced to cut suture tails after knots are secured. On several frames the operator uses a second instrument to hold the knot while trimming, ensuring knot security and tidy tails. There are also intervals where hands reposition over the wound to adjust tension across multiple adjacent bites, flattening slight puckers and checking approximation.

Across these closing frames the suture line is now a continuous series of tied interrupted stitches that approximate the wound edges evenly. Knots sit laterally, slightly projecting off the skin surface; small areas of eversion are visible at each bite site, consistent with the operator’s intent to promote edge inversion control and optimal healing. Surrounding synthetic tissue shows minimal distortion aside from small puncture entries and localized puckering adjacent to knots.

Final inspection and hand repositioning (360.0–375.0 s)
In the concluding frames the operator handles existing suture tails, adjusts knot orientation and gives a final inspection of the closure. There are moments where no needle is visible—reflecting completion of the needle-driven steps—and hands focus on suture management: dressing knots, trimming or tucking tails, and smoothing the approximation. The earlier pattern of alternating needle delivery and tissue stabilization has ceased; the wound is closed by the series of interrupted bites installed during the procedure.

Technique consistency, variation and tissue response
Throughout the entire sequence the fundamental approach remains a simple interrupted technique: each stitch is independently passed, drawn through, tied and trimmed before the operator proceeds to the next adjacent site. This consistent methodology yields predictable, repeatable results. Small variations appear in needle grip (mid‑shaft versus nearer the tip) and in the direction from which the driver approaches the wound (superior, inferior, lateral), but these are ergonomic adaptations rather than changes in technique. The bites are uniformly superficial—epidermal/dermal capture with intentional eversion—rather than deep mattress or buried-subcuticular closures. Instrument coordination is tight: needle driver and tissue forceps operate in opposition across short working distances so that the needle can be delivered in controlled arcs and tissue can be presented cleanly.

Occasionally, frames show the absence of visible instruments or hands, or depict only suture tails being managed manually. These transient lapses do not represent technique changes; rather, they reflect interstitial steps such as knot dressing, tail trimming or inspection. The synthetic tissue responds predictably: edges approximate well with slight eversion at each bite and minimal overall distortion beyond suture entry sites. Small gaps remain between some bites prior to final dressing, but by the end the incision is globally approximated along its length.

Spatial relationships and hand evolution
Hand positions evolve subtly as the operator progresses along the wound. Early in the closure hands straddle the incision with one hand delivering the needle and the other stabilizing tissue. As stitches accumulate, instrument orientation adapts to each new bite location; at times the operator approaches from a cranial angle to reach a superior bite or from an inferior angle for a caudal pass. Frequently the dominant hand performs needle arcs while the non‑dominant hand repositions the forceps, tucks suture tails or introduces scissors. Toward the end of the sequence, one hand at times dominates suture handling directly with fingertips—dressing knots in a way that suggests experience and efficiency. Throughout, instruments remain within a few centimeters of the incision, enabling precise needle control and tactile feedback during knot formation.

Final state of the repair
At the end of the recording the vertical slit is closed by a contiguous series of simple interrupted stitches placed along its length. The wound edges are approximated with slight eversion at each bite and minimal puckering localized at knot sites. Knots sit lateral to the midline of the incision and suture tails have been managed—some trimmed and some tucked—so that the closure is tidy and secure. The surrounding synthetic skin shows only small puncture marks where needles were passed; there is no evidence of undue tissue tearing or gross distortion. Overall, the closure demonstrates a consistent, stepwise application of the interrupted technique: careful tissue presentation with forceps, controlled curved-needle arcs with a needle driver, sequential passage and retrieval of suture, and methodical knot formation and tail management to finalize the repair.

Summary
From start to finish the operator applies a uniform interrupted suturing method to the single central vertical incision. The work progresses in a methodical serial fashion: presentation and eversion of the wound edge, controlled transcutaneous needle arcs capturing dermis, drawing the suture through, knot tying and trimming. Hand and instrument positions adapt to local anatomy but remain tightly coordinated and close to the wound. The end result is a neat approximation of the incision with slight eversion at bite sites, securely tied knots positioned laterally, and minimal surrounding tissue disruption—reflecting a practiced, consistent approach to interrupted skin closure on the simulator model.
