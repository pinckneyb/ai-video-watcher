COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
From the opening moments through the end of the recording, the operator keeps the work concentrated at the same medial-most linear skin slit on the practice pad (the left-most incision). Although a few isolated frames include brief instrument movement or visual ambiguity near adjacent slits, the procedural thread is continuous and unambiguous: this single left-sided incision is repeatedly engaged, receiving sequential interrupted sutures and finishing maneuvers until the line is fully approximated and secured.

Initial approach and early passes (0–120 s)
The case begins with familiar, deliberate preparation. The operator positions both hands close to the left-most slit and establishes the working geometry that will persist throughout the procedure: one hand holds a needle driver while the other controls fine toothed forceps (Adson-style) or fingertip tissue manipulation. The curved, swaged needle is routinely grasped near its mid‑shaft or proximal curve in the jaws of the driver — a grip that allows controlled rotation during passage. The driver is oriented so the needle tip points toward tissue, and small rotational arcs are used to engage and pass the needle through the skin model. The opposing hand everts and steadies the wound edge with forceps, creating a stable target for the bite and minimizing gapping.

Early bites are shallow, full‑thickness through the synthetic dermis, with emphasis on symmetrical bite depth and slight eversion of the epidermal margins. The operator advances each needle pass with small wrist rotations, withdrawing the needle tip as the suture is drawn through. Suture tails are managed externally by the non‑driver hand, which tensions and orients the strand for subsequent knot tying. Across these opening sequences the operator is placing individual interrupted stitches: each bite is executed, the suture pulled through, and preparation begun for knot-tying; no running or continuous pattern is adopted.

Establishing rhythm and pattern (120–300 s)
As the procedure progresses the surgeon establishes a rhythm: needle placement from one margin to the other, retrieval with forceps, suture pull‑through, and then knot‑formation and trimming. The hands trade roles and positions as dictated by approach angle and ergonomics — at times the left hand carries the needle driver and the right hand steadies tissue and suture tails; in other moments the dominant hand approaches from above or from a lateral direction depending on the bite location. Instrument crossing over the wound is common: the needle driver frequently comes in from the superior/cranial side while the forceps approach from an inferior/lateral position. Typical separation between instrument tips remains small (a few centimeters), allowing precise interaction as the curved needle negotiates the short arc through the model tissue.

Needle handling remains consistent: grasp at or near the mid‑shaft for rotation through a controlled arc; reorientation of the driver between passes to position the needle appropriately for the next bite; and brief transfer or repositioning when the trajectory requires a different approach. The surgeon favors perpendicular-to-oblique entry angles for predictable, symmetric bites. Where needed, the forceps lifts the lateral rim to evert and present the dermal edge; where the other side is engaged the same technique is mirrored. The effect is a closely spaced, evenly approximated series of interrupted sutures forming a short zig‑zag pattern along the slit.

Knot technique and suture management are repeated with attention to security and eversion. Multiple throws of the same stitch are seen in several segments, indicating that the operator ties secure square knots with successive throws rather than a single weak loop. In several frames the needle is absent from the wound and the hands step back as knot‑tying is completed — this alternation of passing and securing creates a clear sequential pattern along the incision.

Mid‑procedure consolidation and consistency (300–480 s)
Midway through the recording the operator consolidates technique and proceeds along the incision in a steady, sequential fashion. The bites remain superficial-to-mid dermal on the synthetic pad, and the suture placement stays tightly spaced for precise edge approximation. The operator generally advances from one end of the slit toward the other, placing stitches adjacent to the previously tied ones so that each new knot buttresses the neighboring closure and compresses the edges into alignment.

Throughout this period the relationship of the hands to the wound shows subtle but consistent evolution. The needle driver alternates between coming from a superior/medial trajectory and a lateral approach depending on the bite, while the forceps remains reliably positioned to receive the needle tip and manipulate the emerging suture tail. The operator will often rest one hand lightly on the pad edge for stability while the other performs the delicate needle rotation. Instrument tips often cross above the incision plane to enable optimal needle angles without excessive wrist strain. The distance between the instruments remains small (typically within a few centimeters), permitting coordinated motion and rapid transitions between needle passage, suture drawing, and knot formation.

Tactile handling of the tissue is restrained and atraumatic for a practice model: the forceps pinch and present the edge with light traction to evert the epidermis slightly, then relax as the stitch is seated. This produces even, slightly everted skin margins when the knots are tightened — a consistent technical objective throughout the case. The operator pays attention to suture tail orientation, pulling the tail laterally and keeping it out of the immediate bite path so that subsequent needle passes are unobstructed.

Finishing passes, knot security, and trimming (480–647 s)
In the later stages the operator shifts increasingly toward securing and completing existing stitches at the superior/proximal end, knotting successive throws and trimming suture tails to tidy the closure. The needle is at times held nearer to the swage to allow precise micro‑adjustment for last passes; at other times it is not inserted into tissue at all as the hands focus on knot-tying and tail control. The left hand frequently holds the driver and manipulates the needle during its final use, while the right hand controls the tails and occasionally introduces small scissors or a hemostat for trimming.

Knot formation remains methodical: multiple throws are placed to create a secure knot stack and slight eversion of the wound edges is maintained as the knot is seated. After ties are completed, the scissors/hemostat appears in hand for tail trimming; the operator cuts suture ends close to the knot and then repositions forceps to flatten and smooth the closure. Hands converge over the superior‑left quadrant of the pad for these finishing maneuvers, with instrument tips typically within a few centimeters of the incision.

Throughout the finishing sequence the practicalities of needle and suture handling are evident: when a needle pass is complete the driver is withdrawn and repositioned in anticipation of the next bite, and the non‑driver hand maintains tension on suture tails to prevent loosening. When multiple knots are present along the line, the operator scans along the slit to confirm uniform apposition and edge eversion before trimming the next tail. The whole effect is a carefully executed, sequential interrupted closure of the single left-sided incision.

Technique evolution and consistency
Over the entire recording the basic technique remains consistent: simple interrupted sutures placed sequentially along a single linear incision with attention to eversion, symmetry, and knot security. While instrument orientation, the hand holding the driver, and approach angles vary adaptively with each bite, the underlying principles do not change. The needle is almost always curved and swaged to a short length suitable for the small bites being taken; the grasp point in the driver tends to be mid‑shaft or slightly more proximal to enable rotational control. Passes are performed in controlled arcs, retrieving the needle with forceps or with the driver itself as necessary, followed by prompt knotting with multiple throws. No continuous running suture is adopted; the operator adheres to interrupted throws for predictable tension control and closure.

Hand positions and spatial relationships
Hand positions are dynamic but predictable. Most often the needle driver comes from the superior/medial side while forceps or the free fingers approach from inferior/lateral positions to approximate, evert, and receive the needle. Occasionally these roles reverse if bite location or space constraints suggest a different approach; the surgeon remains ambidextrous in placement and will change driver orientation to maintain proper needle trajectory. Instruments frequently cross above the incision, and distances between instrument tips stay short (commonly 1–8 cm depending on frame perspective). The non‑driver hand alternates between direct tissue handling and suture tail management, stepping back briefly when the driver is passing the needle and reengaging to tension and prepare for knot-tying. At times the non‑driver hand rests on the pad edge to stabilize the field for more delicate passes.

Final state of the closure
By the final frames the left-most incision is uniformly approximated along its length. The dermal margins are closely opposed with slight eversion produced by the upstream bites and maintained during knot tying. The row of interrupted knots sits along the length of the slit, the suture tails trimmed and tucked, and the closure appears neat and secure for the model substrate. No further needle passes into the pad are seen in the concluding frames; the instruments withdraw from the field as the operator finalizes knot security and trims the last tails.

Notes on occasional frame ambiguity
A small number of frames report activity around neighboring incisions or describe instrumentation near adjacent slits. These brief observations represent either camera‑angle shifts, preparatory repositioning, or momentary manipulation of suture tails along the pad. The dominant and continuous pattern throughout, however, is the sequential interrupted closure of the medial-most (left-most) linear incision. Despite minor visual ambiguities, the single-line progression is maintained end-to-end, culminating in a complete set of secure interrupted sutures with well-approximated, slightly everted skin margins and tidy suture tails.

Summary
From start to finish the operator executes a disciplined series of interrupted sutures along the same left-sided incision: deliberate needle placement using a mid‑shaft grip on a curved, swaged needle; forceps-assisted edge eversion and bite control; sequential knot-tying with multiple throws for security; and methodical trimming of suture tails. Hands and instruments adapt in orientation to meet bite geometry but maintain close spatial relationships to ensure precision. The end result is a consistently approximated and secured linear closure along the medial-most slit on the practice pad.
