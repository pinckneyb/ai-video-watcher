COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
At the outset the team concentrates on the superior-most horizontal incision near the top edge of the simulation pad. From the first seconds the work is localized to the left third of that short linear slit: a needle driver in one hand and fine pickups in the other converge just above and slightly lateral to the incision to set the initial bite. The curved needle is routinely grasped well back from the tip (commonly about two‑thirds from the swage or the proximal third of the curve depending on the moment), with the arc oriented approximately perpendicular to the skin surface to permit a controlled, orthogonal entry. The assistant’s forceps tent and evert the epidermal edge a few millimetres from the wound margin as the operator rotates the wrist and drives the needle through the dermis; the suture is pulled through and tensioned to create the first anchoring stitch at the left terminus. Hands sit close together and parallel to the incision, the free tail running laterally and off the field so it does not tangle.

Having established that initial anchoring bite, the operator begins the first sequence of throws to secure it. Early frames show instrument ties: a needle driver is used as the post while the free limb is wrapped and drawn through using Adson-style forceps or a second driver. Knot formation is methodical—alternating loops are laid, snugged, and the knot is advanced directly over the wound apex. Throughout these tying maneuvers the forceps are used minimally on tissue, acting primarily as a post and to control the short end of the suture; the synthetic skin edges are approximated gently as each throw is seated so the corner is not crushed or torn. The technique is careful and atraumatic, with minimal traction applied to the corner apex.

With the first knot secured at the left end, activity progresses along that same superior-most slit. The needle is reloaded into the driver and repositioned near the wound, often regrasped to maintain a balanced arc for the next bite. The team repeatedly reorients the needle to an approximately perpendicular approach and advances it through the dermis a short distance from the wound margin. Forceps are employed to evert the wound lips and present dermis for consistent purchase; the tactile opposition between driver and pickups is used to draw symmetric bites so the edges coapt neatly when tension is applied.

Technique throughout the closure remains consistently classical: perpendicular needle entry, bites taken a uniform distance from the edge, and suture tails managed superiorly and laterally to avoid fouling the needle trajectory. The operator alternates which hand holds which instrument at times, but a pattern emerges—when passing the needle, the driver generally approaches from the surgeon’s left or right depending on site, while forceps provide counter-traction from the opposite side. At the left region the driver often works slightly superior-left of the incision while pickups approach from inferior-right to pull the suture through and tighten. Later passes are placed moving rightward along the same slit, each time the needle grasp point varying slightly (midpoint or proximal third) to optimize control for that particular trajectory.

There are multiple episodes where attention returns to knot-tying rather than passage. Instrument ties are favored in many sequences: the needle driver is used as a post and the free end is wrapped and drawn through with forceps or a second driver. These throws are alternated in direction and tensioned carefully so the knot lies flat and centered over the wound line. At other times the operator uses direct finger control to manage the free limb when seating the knot, switching seamlessly between instrument ties and manual manipulation depending on ergonomics at that moment. Throughout, instrument tips are kept within a few millimetres of the wound edge to maintain precise control; when one hand crosses over the incision to manipulate the short end the fingers and jaws remain parallel to the incision to limit tissue distortion.

As the session progresses, the procedural rhythm becomes evident: prepare bite, present dermis with pickups, orient needle perpendicular, drive through with a clean arc, regrasp and pull the suture through, then secure with sequential throws. Between passes the needle is commonly reloaded—rotated and repositioned in the jaws to restore an ideal arc for the next entry. This reloading is performed in close proximity to the incision and frequently involves brief crossing of instruments over the wound line; both hands stay coordinated and just millimetres from the skin surface to preserve a consistent needle trajectory.

An observable evolution in hand positions occurs while working along the length of the slit. Early work at the left terminus shows the left hand holding the driver above and left of the wound with the right hand stabilizing the edge; later the operator in some sequences swaps sides—right hand holding the driver and left the forceps—based on the orientation needed to approach the bite point comfortably. When knot-tying is required the driver used to form loops is usually placed just adjacent to the knot site while the contralateral hand crosses over to tension and pull the short end through. While these changes alter which hand is dominant at any instant, the spatial relationship to the incision remains consistent: instruments straddle the wound with one on either side, jaws parallel to the wound, and motions directed across the midline.

Work revisits the same superior slit repeatedly. Multiple passes are placed progressively from the left toward the right end. Each new pass is set up by a brief period of tissue presentation and needle alignment: the pickups tent the near edge to clearly expose the dermal layer, the driver aligns the needle with the arc pointing toward the opposite margin, and a controlled wrist motion yields a precise bite. Where forceps are used to evert the edge there is careful avoidance of excessive crushing; the synthetic dermis shows symmetric, small bite widths and even distances from the incision line, aiming for eversion and edge apposition.

At various points the narrative of the procedure shows the needle exiting at or near the right terminus of the slit. When the needle is brought through, the operator sometimes leaves an anchoring knot on the skin surface to secure the line before trimming. These anchor knots are fashioned by forming a series of throws over the driver and trimming the excess with scissors—again, instruments come close together over the wound and the scissors are introduced from a controlled angle to cut tails while preserving knot security. In several frames the final throws and trimming are explicitly observed: the knot is cinched, the assistant stabilizes it, and the scissors approach to remove the excess.

Throughout the session, the needle handling shows small variations: sometimes grasped near the midpoint for greater control of arc through thicker bites, sometimes near the proximal third to enhance leverage when passing near the edge. Irrespective of the grasp point the orientation remains deliberate—aims to pass the needle orthogonally to the plane of the skin so the bite depth is consistent and the opposing dermis is captured symmetrically. After passes, regripping occurs to facilitate pull‑through and to reset the needle for a subsequent bite; this cyclic reloading is a hallmark of the methodical approach.

Spatial relationships are tight and reproducible: the driver usually operates just above or to one side of the incision with forceps opposing it a few millimetres away. As stitches are placed across the length, the hands alternately advance along the slit, maintaining proximity to the wound and avoiding long reaches that could compromise needle balance. When a suture is being tied, the hands often cross over the midline above the wound so that alternating throws can be laid on top of each other and then pushed down toward the skin. When openings are small or at a corner, one instrument may act as a post while the other wraps the short end to create secure knots without slippage.

Despite the overall consistency of technique, a small number of frames describe activity that appears focused on a slightly different horizontal line or at different regions; however, the prevailing pattern indicates a continuous closure of the superior-most slit. Where descriptions diverge—mentioning midline or second-level slits—the hands quickly return to the superior slit and the bulk of needle passages, knot formation, and final trimming occur on that top line. This suggests either occasional close-by instrument maneuvers or descriptive ambiguity, but the operative intent and closure trajectory remain centered on the top slit without diversion to other parallel cuts.

In the later stages the operator completes final passes toward the right end, secures anchoring knots, and performs the finishing throws with alternating directions to ensure knot security. The suture tails are kept short and trimmed cleanly; scissors are introduced with the same controlled, millimetre-level precision as earlier motions. After the last throws are seated and the tails trimmed, instruments are withdrawn laterally from the immediate area and placed aside. A final inspection shows the superior slit approximated along its length with evenly opposed edges and subtle eversion—tension distributed so the wound lies coapted without puckering.

Overall, the closure demonstrates a disciplined, reproducible technique: perpendicular dermal bites, symmetric edge capture, consistent use of pickups to evert tissue, methodical reloading of the curved needle, and secure instrument- or finger-based knotting techniques that alternate throws to create low-profile, stable knots. Hand positions adapt dynamically—switching which hand holds the driver or pickups—but instrument placement relative to the wound remains stable, closely coordinated, and oriented to preserve needle arc and tissue apposition. By the end of the procedure the superior-most horizontal incision is closed along its length with neatly approximated, everted edges and securely tied knots, excess suture trimmed, and instruments withdrawn, leaving a cleanly coapted closure suitable for healing.
