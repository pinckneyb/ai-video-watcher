Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion and flow were controlled and methodical, with consistent triangulation and clean transitions between driving, tensioning, tying, and trimming. Needle handling showed good adherence to the arc with predominantly perpendicular entries and symmetric bites; knot work was square and seated over the line, and tensioning approximated edges without blanching. The closure line ended up organized, with uniform spacing and tidy tails.
