COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session opens on the longest, central midline incision of the practice pad. Working at its inferior end, the right hand presents a loaded needle driver perpendicular to the skin, while the left hand’s Adson forceps lift and evert the far (left) margin. The needle is grasped on its body (about the proximal third to two‑thirds from the tip) and driven in a smooth arc from the near (right) edge across to the far side, taking symmetric, full‑thickness dermal bites a few millimeters from each edge. The driver follows the curvature; the left forceps guide the exit and maintain gentle eversion as the needle emerges. The suture is pulled through, creating a loop bridging the gap. A hemostat briefly controls the long end on the right as tension is balanced.

With the thread across the wound, the team begins to secure the stitch over the lower third. The needle is released or parked momentarily while the right hand uses the driver to perform instrument ties over the incision. The left hand manages the short end and/or forceps to maintain edge approximation. Loops are formed across the wound line; the driver crosses above the slit, grasps the free end, and seats the first throw centrally, bringing the edges together without crushing. Subsequent throws follow to begin locking the knot, and the wound edges show improved approximation.

Attention then shifts a few centimeters cephalad along this same long incision. The left hand again steadies the left margin with forceps; the right hand reloads the needle perpendicular to the surface and takes another right‑to‑left pass near the mid‑portion. The needle is regripped near the swage to complete the arc cleanly, and the strand is drawn through to equalize lengths. The driver and forceps oppose each other across the slit, keeping the field tidy as the suture arcs across the center. With this pass across the central region completed, instrument ties are used to secure the stitch: the driver forms loops over the wound while the opposite hand maintains counter‑tension, seating the knot squarely over the centerline.

Building on that, the operator moves superiorly along the same incision to place the next stitch above the one just tied. The forceps lift the left edge; the right hand drives the needle into the right margin, following the curve to exit the left, then regrips the needle near the swaged end to reposition for the reciprocal bite if needed. The suture is pulled through to lay the strands, but tying is deferred while the field is reorganized for the next step.

Briefly, the focus turns to a different, shorter midline practice cut that lies between two longer slits. A single simple‑interrupted stitch already spans its midpoint. The right hand, holding the needle driver near the knot area, releases the instrument and sets it aside. With the needle left parked on the left strand, both hands transition to hand ties. The right hand crosses over the incision to form the loop, and the throws are tightened symmetrically to draw the knot down over the small wound without further needle passage.

The operator then returns to the longer central incision at its upper third, where the previously passed stitch is ready to secure. The left forceps hold the left edge with slight eversion; the right hand uses the needle driver to perform instrument ties, alternately crossing over the wound, grasping the free end, and drawing the throws snug. Tension is alternated between hands to seat the knot neatly over the wound and preserve eversion. Scissors lie idle nearby; tails are left long for the moment.

The sequence closes back on the short central cut to finish its closure. The needle remains off to the side; no new tissue bites are taken. Hand ties continue until the knot is secure and centered. The right hand then exchanges the driver for scissors, and with the left hand controlling the tails close to the knot, the right hand trims them to complete the stitch.

Across the procedure, the technique remains consistent: forceps in the left hand to present and evert the dermal edge; a needle driver in the right hand holding the needle perpendicular, regripped as needed near the swage for control; arcs driven right‑to‑left across the gap with full‑thickness bites placed a few millimeters from the margin; and knots formed either with instrument ties (on the longer incision) or hand ties (on the short practice cut). Spatially, the hands oppose each other across the wound at all times—converging over the centerline to pass the needle, then crossing and separating during knot formation to seat throws directly over the incision.

By the end, the long central incision is partially approximated with multiple simple‑interrupted stitches—one secured low to mid and another secured in the upper‑mid portion, with additional passes laid for subsequent placement—while the shorter central slit is closed with a single, hand‑tied simple‑interrupted stitch whose tails are trimmed. The lateral slits remain untouched throughout.
