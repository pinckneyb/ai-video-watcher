COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The session unfolds as a methodical closure of the left-most vertical incision on the synthetic pad, performed with simple interrupted sutures and supported by careful tissue handling and consistent instrument choreography. Across the video, the operator repeatedly returns to and advances this same vertical cut along the left edge of the pad, building a contiguous line of evenly spaced stitches from its lower segment toward its superior end. Short interludes occur elsewhere on the pad—brief demonstrations at other markings, momentary organization of suture, or preparatory moves that do not progress to placement—yet the closure itself proceeds on the left vertical wound and is completed there with instrument ties and systematic trimming. The following narrative traces that closure chronologically while acknowledging those brief off-line moments without conflating them with the primary repair.

Initial engagement and first bite on the left vertical cut
The work begins at the lower third of the left-most vertical incision, a straight, shallow slit with slightly separated edges near the left margin of the pad. The operator uses a standard needle-on-driver setup: the curved needle is grasped at the proximal third to mid-body in the needle holder, with the curve oriented to enter perpendicular to the pad surface. Opposite the driver, Adson forceps in the other hand gently pick up just enough skin to evert the near edge, presenting the dermis cleanly without crushing. The first bite is initiated on the left margin, a few millimeters back from the edge, with the driver carrying the needle in a controlled arc to set the direction of the pass across the wound. In this opening sequence the strand trails superiorly and is kept clear of the field, indicating preparation for a classic orthogonal bite and simple interrupted closure.

A brief detour to a nearby corner and a transverse mark, then resumption on the left line
Immediately after this first engagement, the operator briefly manipulates a small L-shaped corner wound at the pad’s lower-left border. The needle driver and pickups oppose each other over the acute corner; a bite is placed and tied at that corner apex and the knot secured. This is a short, isolated corner maneuver that does not alter the plan for the left vertical wound closure.

A further short sequence shows a stitch being completed at the far-left end of a horizontal line in the lower third of the pad: the bite is tied, tails are trimmed, and the needle is reloaded for the next pass along that transverse cut. This, too, is a discrete action separate from the left vertical closure and lasts only long enough to finish a knot and prepare the driver for subsequent work. Soon after, scissors and pickups are used over a short linear wound in the upper-left quadrant to trim tails from a recently tied stitch, followed by reloading the needle to continue placing another pass on that same short line. Again, these moments are brief and self-contained; they read as warm-up and housekeeping gestures around the field and do not become a sustained closure. The primary work returns to and remains on the left vertical slit as the session progresses.

Occasional single-bite demonstrations at other points on the pad
Before the left vertical series builds momentum, the operator makes a few isolated passes at other markings without carrying them forward. Near the left-center of the pad, a small punctate defect is lifted with pickups and closed with a single stitch; on the curved mark across the lower third of the pad, a single interrupted stitch at the left segment is cinched with instrument ties. Each of these is handled with the same fundamental technique—needle held on the proximal third, perpendicular entry, short wrist rotations following the needle’s curvature, forceps used to evert and present tissue, and careful tension to avoid tearing or over-puckering—yet none of these diversions continues. They serve as brief demonstrations while the closure of the left vertical wound evolves into the definitive focus.

Return to the left edge and establishment of the simple interrupted sequence
Work then settles decisively onto the left-most vertical incision and stays there for the bulk of the procedure. Along this line, multiple segments show a consistent pattern:

- The driver—sometimes in the left hand, sometimes in the right depending on approach—presents the needle perpendicular to the skin, grasped at the proximal third to the midshaft to maximize control.
- Adson pickups in the opposite hand elevate minimal tissue at each edge to evert, expose the dermis, and set the depth. The operator favors symmetric bites equidistant from each margin.
- The needle is advanced across the slit with short wrist rotations that follow the curve; the driver commonly releases and regrips near the needle tip to complete the pass and then again to pull the needle through cleanly.
- After the pass, the operator manages tension with a measured, gentle traction that draws the edges together without blanching or excessive puckering.

In one such sequence, a small triangular gap at the far left edge is closed: the superior/left edge is taken first, the needle is reloaded, and the opposing edge is engaged. Instrument ties follow immediately at the wound’s lateral side: loops are thrown sequentially with alternation in direction to square the knot, and the knot is seated flush at the margin. This cadence repeats as the repair marches superiorly along the length of the slit. At points, the driver is parked temporarily at the upper-left pad edge while the assisting hand tidies the strand and evaluates the previous stitches; the suture is kept draped away from the working field to preserve visualization.

Adding stitches near the superior half and managing knots
As the series advances to the top portion of the left slit, the operator adds further simple interrupted stitches using the same orthogonal approach. The driver remains just superior-left of the slit, crossing over only when necessary to retrieve the needle or to snug down and lock a knot. Pickups stabilize the opposite edge, lift the dermis, and control depth and spacing. Tension is controlled deliberately; the resulting approximation shows mild, acceptable eversion and small, regular puckers adjacent to each knot—typical of a neatly spaced interrupted closure on a synthetic pad.

In one extended sequence at the upper half of the wound, the operator completes a pass and then performs instrument ties with the needle holder on the long strand while the assisting hand manages the short tail. Throws alternate direction to square the knot and avoid slippage; the knot is deliberately seated to the side in line with the prior knots to keep the wound edges unburdened by bulk. Later frames show the operator drawing the knot down and then trimming tails, first on a lower stitch and then sequentially on stitches moving superiorly. Scissors approach parallel to the incision line, their tips angled to cut tails close to the knot without jeopardizing its integrity, while the assisting instrument (driver or pickups) lightly tensions the tail to present it for a precise cut.

Intermissions that do not change the primary closure
Interspersed with the above are several non-progressive sequences elsewhere on the pad:

- A small circular opening on the left side receives one or two rim bites with careful rim eversion; the suture is managed to the right. This has the feel of a purse-string demonstration, but it is not pursued further and has no bearing on the ongoing left-vertical repair.
- At the central vertical slit, the operator twice appears to prepare for a pass: the needle is loaded and aligned near the inferior end, or positioned at the superior margin with the right hand managing the trailing strand. In these sequences, there is no eversion of central wound edges, no tissue penetration, and no completed throw; they read as needle-loading and setup only, with no subsequent suture placed or tied on that central line within the observed intervals.
- Two brief corner demonstrations occur: one at the lower-left L-shaped corner early on, and another later at the lower-right pad corner where the near edge is everted with forceps and a pass is initiated. These corner actions are self-contained, do not transition into a run of stitches, and remain distinct from the left vertical closure.
- At two points, the field shows the central incision while the hands are idle below the pad or an ID card is placed over the pad. No instruments contact the skin, no needle or suture is visible, and no stitches are placed in these intervals. One segment is notably obstructed by a card, preventing visualization of any potential action; however, no suturing actions are evident there.

Building the line and keeping technique consistent
Returning to the main closure repeatedly, the operator demonstrates consistency in both hand relationships and technique execution:

- The driver and pickups oppose each other across the slit, forming a tight working triangle just a few centimeters across. The driver typically approaches from the superior-left, the pickups from the inferior-right, though hand dominance swaps at times as the angle requires.
- The needle is always grasped proximal to the tip for leverage, and the entry point is set back appropriately from the edge for a superficial dermal-to-epidermal bite. Depth and spacing are kept symmetrical from side to side, and the curve is followed through the tissue rather than pushing straight, preserving the needle’s path and tissue integrity.
- Upon completing a pass, the driver commonly regrips the needle near the tip to pull through, then transitions smoothly into instrument tying. The assisting hand either maintains the short tail or, when necessary, briefly crosses beneath to feed the tail to the driver during the throw. Throws are alternated deliberately to square each knot, and tension is modulated to seat the knot down neatly against the skin without strangulation.
- After tying, scissors approach with the tips nearly parallel to the incision; the assisting instrument or fingers present the tail for a clean, close cut. Where multiple knots are present, the operator moves systematically from one to the next, stabilizing each knot as tails are trimmed to an even length.

Mid-course refinement and preparation at the superior end
Several sequences show the operator concentrating near the superior end of the left slit. Bites are placed carefully at matching heights across the wound, and the knots are seated in line with earlier ones, producing a uniform series down the wound. At points the operator pauses to park the needle at the pad’s upper-left to keep it safe and out of the way while assessing the prior stitches with pickups—lifting edges gently, confirming that approximation is maintained and that the sequence of knots is properly aligned and tensioned.

In one of these upper segments, after placing and tying a stitch, the surgeon uses the needle holder to tension the standing end while the other hand manages the free end to “set” the knot to the preferred lateral side. In another, the driver is used solely as a tying instrument—grasping the tail to pass it through loops as the other hand forms and flips the loops—demonstrating comfort with instrument ties even when the needle itself is not immediately traversing tissue. Across these sequences the spacing and alignment of the growing line of knots remains consistent, with the edges approximated cleanly.

Final tying, sequential trimming, and completion of the closure
As the closure nears completion, attention shifts predominantly to finishing maneuvers on the left vertical slit: final stitches are tied near the top of the wound, and several sequences are devoted to trimming. The right hand often controls the suture tails with a driver or pickups, presenting them for the scissors coming in from the superior-left. Tails are cut close to each knot while ensuring the knot stays seated; no knots are undermined or loosened during this process. The operator moves down the line methodically, leaving evenly trimmed tails that sit just above the skin surface.

A short sequence shows bare-handed manipulation of suture ends at a small left-corner wound, likely a final snugging or tail management on that separate corner stitch. This is an isolated action and does not alter the completed appearance of the left vertical series.

Non-operative intervals and an obstructed field
Near the end of the session there are intervals in which the central vertical line is centered in view without any active suturing: hands are below the field, or a forearm briefly crosses without contact. Finally, an ID card is placed over the pad, obscuring much of the mid-to-lower field including the central incision; no needle, suture, or tissue manipulation is visible during this obstructed interval. These segments do not change the status of the completed left vertical closure.

Technique characteristics and evolution
Throughout, the technique remains a simple interrupted closure as labeled and intended. Even when the operator briefly demonstrates isolated passes at other locations—corner bites, a punctate lesion, or a curved mark—the fundamental method remains the same: orthogonal entry, symmetric depth, forceps for gentle eversion, short arc-driven passes, instrument ties with alternating throws, and deliberate knot seating. On the primary left vertical wound, this approach repeats stitch after stitch, progressing superiorly with constant attention to edge presentation and tension control. The operator occasionally switches which hand holds the driver, optimizing angles for bite placement and knot tying, but maintains the opposing-hand relationship and close working distances that characterize controlled, efficient suturing.

Spatial relationships are disciplined and consistent. The driver sits superior-left to the wound for most passes, with the pickups inferior-right, keeping wrists close and movements compact. During tying, the driver crosses over the wound when necessary to capture or deliver the tail; the assisting hand either feeds the tail or stabilizes the knot site, always keeping motions centered over the line. The suture strand is consciously managed—trailed superiorly or laterally, draped across the pad only when parked—to avoid entanglement and preserve a clear view of the bite site.

Final state of the repair
By the end of the procedure, the left-most vertical incision is closed with a series of simple interrupted stitches that span from the lower portion where the first engagement occurred to the superior end where the final stitches were added. The edges are approximated without gapping, with gentle eversion along the line and expected, modest puckering adjacent to each knot. Knots are seated in a consistent lateral position alongside the wound rather than directly atop the incision, minimizing bulk over the coaptation line. Tails have been trimmed sequentially and lie short and even, indicating orderly completion and attention to postoperative management. No additional stitches are added to the central vertical slit in the observed intervals, and the short demonstration stitches at other locations remain discrete and do not interrupt or substitute for the primary closure. The overall impression is of a controlled, stepwise simple interrupted closure of the left vertical wound, executed with careful tissue handling, reliable needle control, and systematic knot tying and trimming to a tidy finish.
