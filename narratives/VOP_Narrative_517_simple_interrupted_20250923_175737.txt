COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a multi-incision training pad, but all attention and work remain concentrated on a single central midline slit located in the lower half of the field. This incision becomes the focus for a stepwise, simple interrupted closure using instrument ties. Over the course of the video, the surgeon methodically advances along this wound, alternating between placing new stitches, securing them with sequential throws, and trimming the tails to maintain an orderly, low-profile line. At points the pad and camera orientation change; the same midline wound briefly appears short and transverse in the frame, then returns to being seen vertically. Despite these visual shifts, the hands, instruments, and suture activity consistently stay on the same line, and the surrounding practice cuts are not engaged.

The sequence begins with setup and the first pass at the lower portion of the midline slit. The right hand holds tissue forceps and elevates the right wound edge to present the dermis; the left hand brings in a needle driver grasping a curved needle roughly two-thirds from the tip. The needle is oriented perpendicular to the skin. With the forceps stabilizing the far edge and providing gentle eversion, the needle driver advances in a smooth arc through the near lip, across the gap, and then to the far lip. The suture is drawn through to deliver a tail and a standing limb, establishing the first stitch of the session at the inferior segment of the incision. Immediately afterward, the driver and the free end are used to form instrument throws; the knot is seated centrally over the slit with measured tension so the edges just touch and slightly evert without blanching or gapping.

Building on that start, another stitch follows along the same wound. The needle is reloaded at the proximal third to maintain good control, the hand positions are maintained across the incision, and the driver again arcs the needle through symmetric bites. The left and right hands cross briefly as the operator regrips the needle and pulls the thread through. The knotting is again performed with an instrument tie—wrapping the suture around the driver, grasping the opposite limb, and advancing the throw down to the wound. Successive throws alternate direction to square and lock the knot. The pattern is consistent: careful bite placement, precise handling near the dermal margins, then deliberate knot construction that brings the edges together smoothly along the midline.

The next stitch continues in similar fashion. Here, the needle holder remains in the left hand and the right hand manages the free strand and helps stabilize tissue with fingertips. The needle is driven left-to-right, then regripped to complete passage, and the suture is pulled through. The knot is formed directly over the incision, and the sequence transitions seamlessly into tying. The throws are tightened sequentially, and the operator ensures the knot sits flat, with tails of modest length aligned with the wound axis.

As tying continues over the lower-center segment, the surgeon maintains a compact working envelope immediately above the wound. The needle driver works directly over the slit, and the opposing hand posts the standing end to keep tension and guide the knot seat. Throughout, no additional tissue bites are taken during these tying sequences—this portion is strictly about securing the placed stitch. The edges approximate cleanly under suture tension; forceps are intentionally not used here, and eversion is accomplished by the knot mechanics alone.

Immediately afterward, the tails from a recently tied stitch are trimmed. Scissors enter from the left, the right hand stabilizes the pad just distal to the wound, and the tails are cut short to tidy the field. With the tails trimmed, the surgeon prepares a new loaded needle for the next stitch on the same line, bringing it in from the upper-right while the other hand coordinates the needle holder position just superior/left of the incision. At this moment no new penetration occurs, but the setup signals the next pass is imminent.

The view then shifts: the same short central segment of the midline slit appears as a transverse cut in the frame due to pad/camera reorientation. The work continues uninterrupted on this same wound. The left hand now holds the needle driver and the right hand uses Adson forceps. The forceps evert the near edge at the dermal margin; the needle, held at the proximal-to-middle third and perpendicular to the skin, advances through one edge and across to the other, following its curvature. The forceps briefly capture the needle tip to guide exit and facilitate controlled pull-through. The pass is completed cleanly, leaving the suture crossing the small central portion of the wound and preparing for knotting.

A complementary pass follows on the same small central segment. The right hand maintains the needle driver and advances the needle in a controlled arc from the right lip toward the left, the left instrument (forceps or a second driver) capturing the needle as it emerges. The motion remains crisp and perpendicular to the wound, with bites set at consistent depth and distance from the edge. The suture is pulled through to distribute the thread, leaving an adequate tail for subsequent ties.

Attention turns to securing the stitch. The operator keeps the needle parked in the driver above the field while manipulating the two suture limbs to perform a sequence of instrument throws. The driver serves as a tying tool: it wraps the working strand, crosses the incision to grasp the opposite limb, and draws each throw down until the knot meets the wound surface. The non-dominant hand posts the other limb to provide steady counter-tension. With each throw, the edges coapt more snugly, and slight puckering appears immediately around the knot—an expected finding indicating apposition and mild eversion. The knot is finished with multiple alternating throws for security, and the scissors are brought in to trim the ends flush to the knot.

Working just above a prior knot on this same small central segment, the surgeon takes another bite. The tissue forceps hover over the upper lip, everting and presenting the edge as the needle driver advances a symmetric dermal bite. The needle follows its arc without plunging, and the suture is drawn through. The right hand and left hand remain opposite each other across the wound, converging at the center during passage and separating during pull-through. The stitch is subsequently tied with an instrument tie, the driver crossing over the centerline to manipulate and seat the knot midline. The edges remain in close apposition along this small window, with the inferior aspect held by a prior stitch and the new knot centering superior to it. Throughout these maneuvers, the scissor is kept off-field until trimming, and the movements remain compact, within a few millimeters of the wound.

At this stage, the pattern is established: on this same midline slit, the surgeon alternates between placing new stitches and securing them. Sometimes the driver is in the left hand and sometimes in the right, reflecting ergonomic adjustment to the angle of attack and the location along the wound. Tissue forceps are used intermittently to evert and control the edges during passage but are often set aside during knotting so that the driver can function as a knot pusher. Each knot is tightened with care to achieve edge coaptation without strangulation.

The field then expands again to show the longer vertical aspect of the same incision, now with a short row of interrupted stitches already seated in the central segment. Focus turns to the newest stitch at the center: the needle holder is used as a knotting instrument and, after completing the throws, the scissors enter from the left to cut the tails. The knot sits centrally, producing slight puckering that is symmetric across the midline. No new passes occur in this brief interval; it is a finishing-and-trimming moment that confirms secure approximation.

Preparing for the next advance along the same line, the surgeon reloads the needle. Pickups grasp the epidermal margin near the prior knots to evert the lip gently. The driver holds the needle at about two-thirds from the tip, its curvature oriented orthogonally to the incision. The instruments straddle the slit: pickups on the near/right edge, driver approaching from the left. Several small repositioning steps refine the angle so that the needle will enter perpendicularly at the desired location just inferior to the existing stitches. In these frames the setup is deliberate; no new penetration is made yet, but the alignment is precise, anticipating the next bite.

The next pass is then executed at the inferior end of the same incision. The left hand carries the driver and advances the needle perpendicularly. The right hand, now using forceps, gently lifts and everts the target edge to present the dermis and control exit. The needle takes consistent, symmetric bites through one edge and then the opposing edge, emerging with the tip guided by the forceps. The suture is pulled through, leaving a loop and a manageable tail. The sequence flows into knot tying: the right hand transitions away from forceps to manage the suture end while the driver crosses over the wound to form instrument throws. The knot is seated with measured, alternating traction so it lies flat and centered, bringing the inferior edges together with slight, uniform puckering.

Immediately after securing this stitch, the needle is regrasped and positioned at the left lower wound edge, oriented perpendicular to the incision for the next planned bite. The left hand’s forceps or fingertips provide gentle counter-traction to present the entry site. Although the needle is poised and the setup clear, the actual penetration for the next stitch is deferred in these frames, indicating a pause to assess spacing and edge alignment.

Tension is then adjusted on the newly placed stitch at the lower portion. The driver crosses the incision to tighten the throws one last time, ensuring that the knot sits snugly without inverting the edges. The right hand maintains steady tension on the free end while the left hand advances each throw; edges show slight eversion under the knot with no visible gapping. The sequence progresses toward trimming; although scissors are not yet in use in this clip, the knot is clearly completed.

Attention returns to the core of the wound where several stitches already secure the midline. The operator trims the tails on existing knots with scissors held directly over the line while the opposite hand stabilizes the pad. With the tails shortened and the field neat, the needle holder and forceps re-enter, now positioned near the superior third of the same slit. The needle is loaded at about two-thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and presented near the top end of the wound. The suture strand trails free, ready for controlled passage.

Moving up toward the superior segment, the surgeon places another stitch. The driver advances the needle in a controlled arc from the right lip to the left, with forceps briefly capturing the needle tip to guide exit and protect the tissue. Bites are consistent in depth and distance from the edge, and both lips are slightly everted by coordinated handling. The suture is drawn through, leaving adequate tail for tying. No knot is formed yet in this exact moment; the emphasis is on disciplined passage that honors the curvature of the needle and the perpendicular approach to the skin.

That pass is then secured with an instrument-tied knot at the superior portion of the wound. The driver manipulates the suture ends to form successive throws; the left hand posts the standing limb laterally to create a stable “post,” and the right hand advances each throw down to the wound. The knot is seated so that it lies neatly alongside the earlier knots, continuing the linear, evenly spaced set along the slit. After confirming security, scissors enter to cut the ends close to the knot, leaving a tidy finish.

Near the conclusion of the series, the surgeon ties and trims another stitch in the upper-middle segment, again using the needle holder primarily as a knot pusher. The hands operate close together, parallel to the incision, and within millimeters of the wound. The knot is snugged, tails are cut, and the row appears straight and uniform. This repetition demonstrates consistent technique and attention to detail—throws are reversed appropriately during tying, tension is balanced, and tissue handling remains gentle.

A final sequence shows yet another stitch being cinched and the tails trimmed in the middle of the row. The right hand controls the suture ends directly over the midline, while the left hand brings in the needle driver to help tighten and to push the knot into its final seated position. No new needle passes occur in this brief window; the goal here is secure final positioning and a clean cut of the tails. The resulting line shows evenly spaced knots with mild, symmetric puckering along the coapted wound edges.

The last frames provide a static confirmation of the result. No hands or tools are present. The central vertical wound sits midline with a neatly completed series of simple interrupted stitches holding the edges together. The knots are closely spaced and aligned, eversion is modest and uniform, and there is no gapping. The surrounding longer practice slits remain untouched throughout.

Across the entire procedure, the technique is consistent and progresses logically along the same incision:

- Needle handling: The needle is repeatedly grasped at the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip in the driver, kept perpendicular to the skin, and advanced in controlled arcs that respect its curvature. After partial passage the driver often regrips to complete pull-through, and the needle is reloaded between stitches to recover an optimal angle. On several occasions, the forceps briefly capture the tip during exit to guide it gently and avoid tissue crush.

- Tissue handling: Forceps are used intermittently to evert and present the dermal edge for entry and exit, particularly during new passes on the inferior and superior portions. At other times, eversion is achieved primarily by the vector of suture tension as knots are seated. Throughout, previously placed stitches maintain approximation and help define spacing for the next bite. Traction is gentle; there is no undue blanching or tearing at the margins.

- Knotting: All stitches are secured with instrument ties. The driver doubles as a tying tool and knot pusher—wrapping, grasping the opposing limb, and advancing each throw. Throws are alternated to square the knot, and final tensioning is balanced across both limbs to lay the knot flat and centered. Each knot is trimmed with scissors to leave short tails, keeping the field tidy and the line low-profile.

- Hand positions and spatial relationships: The hands consistently straddle the incision, converging over the center during needle passage and crossing during knot throws. Dominance alternates—sometimes the driver is in the right hand, sometimes in the left—based on the direction of passage and the segment of the wound being addressed. Instruments remain within a few millimeters of the edges, and the working triangles are compact and controlled. At several moments the pad orientation changes, making the same wound appear differently aligned in the frame; nonetheless, the instruments and suture activity never depart from the same midline slit.

By the end, the midline incision is closed with a straight, evenly spaced row of interrupted stitches. The edges are gently everted and well coapted, prior tail trims leave a clean operative field, and no additional bites are pending. The final static view underscores the orderly closure achieved through careful planning, precise needle control, disciplined knotting, and consistent hand coordination along the same wound from start to finish.
