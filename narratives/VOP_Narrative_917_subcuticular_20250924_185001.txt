COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds on a single, straight vertical laceration on a silicone skin pad. From the opening frames to the end, all instrument work, needle passes, knotting, and inspection are carried out on this same line, progressing methodically from the inferior end upward toward the superior end. Camera angle and hand dominance shift at multiple points, and the pad orientation appears to rotate slightly during the session; at times the wound seems to sit more centrally and at other times to drift slightly to the right or into the lower-right quadrant of the field. Despite these vantage changes, there is no diversion to a different cut: each maneuver returns to and advances closure on this one vertical incision.

The closure begins at the inferior apex where the wound gapes most and where a foundational stitch is placed to set the line of approximation. With the wound stabilized by tissue forceps on the right margin, the needle is loaded in the driver at roughly two-thirds from the tip and brought in perpendicular to the skin surface. The first pass is forehand, taken across the lower corner with small, symmetric bites in the dermis/subdermis to establish accurate edge apposition without over-tension. After the needle traverses and is regripped to complete the arc, the operator transitions to instrument ties below the incision, using the driver to lay successive throws while the opposite hand maintains the short end. This first knot secures the lower corner, provides an anchor point for traction during subsequent passes, and sets the alignment for the remainder of the wound.

Immediately after this foundational stitch, the scene shifts only slightly up the same line. The hands trade roles briefly as both drivers are used to complete an instrument tie and snug the knot down over the midline of the incision. The knot is set on the epidermal surface with care to avoid skin crushing, and the suture ends are controlled with precision. In a subsequent sequence, the right-hand driver is used primarily to tension the suture rather than to carry the needle. Once the knot is seated satisfactorily, scissors appear from the left to trim the ends. The tails are cut to an appropriate length, leaving a tidy knot stack at the midpoint of the wound’s early closure. This cementing action confirms an interrupted placement at this level of the line and clears the field for continued work superiorly.

The next segment of work drops back down to the lower portion again, where the incision appears slightly offset from center because of the camera perspective. The pattern of instrument handling remains consistent: the right hand advances the needle driver with the needle grasped near mid-body and oriented perpendicular to the skin; the left hand uses fine tissue forceps to evert and steady the near edge. The driver advances toward the left/near edge to initiate the next bite. Forceps apply only the minimal lift needed to present dermis, protecting the synthetic skin from tearing and promoting a crisp, everted entry. The opposite wound edge is opened with gentle retraction to visualize the inner lumen. This preparation precedes another stitch placed across this same incision, advancing closure without yet tightening a knot in this clip.

With the inferior anchor secure and the lower-right segment prepared, attention moves a notch higher. A clear view shows the vertical slit with a knot at its inferior apex, and the next pass is taken just above it. The left hand holds the needle driver while the right hand manages tissue forceps; the bites remain small and symmetric, with the needle traversing left-to-right under the incision before the tip is retrieved on the far/right side. After the arc is completed and the suture drawn through, the needle is regripped near the swage for controlled pull-through. The suture loop is managed above the field to prevent tangling with the pad and to keep the line of torsion centered. This step extends the closure in a neat, stepwise fashion upward from the initial knot.

At the inferior end, another stitch is secured and tied. The forceps again pick up the dermal edge carefully to evert the tissue as the knot is seated; the knot at this corner locks the edges into new alignment, and then the needle is reloaded for the next pass, this time a bit more cranial. The alternating sequence—pass a stitch, draw the strand through, secure with a tie, reset the needle—creates a clear rhythm that steadily reduces the gapping along the lower third of the incision.

As work proceeds to the central segment, both hands oppose each other across the wound with the needle driver now on the left and the forceps on the right. The driver grasps the needle at the proximal third to mid-body, maintains a 90-degree entry angle, and follows the curvature through the near dermis, under the wound, and out through the far dermis. The forceps are used sparingly: just enough to lift the edge for entry and to help present the far edge for needle exit. When the tip emerges, the driver releases and regrips as needed to maintain a smooth arc and to retrieve the needle cleanly without tearing. With the pass completed, the suture is drawn across, slack is managed away from the wound, and the needle is parked out of the critical zone while the operator prepares to tie.

In the midline around the center of the wound, a complete interrupted throw is performed. The right-hand driver manipulates the loop while the left maintains counter-tension on the standing limb, keeping the knot seated directly over the incision. Multiple instrument throws are laid with attention to directionality, producing a flat knot that holds approximation without undue blanching. Once secure, the knot is trimmed. The sequence leaves a visible, tidy knot stack at the center of the slit, and the needle is reloaded to continue superiorly.

From this point, the technique begins to flow with more continuity between bites. The right hand predominantly controls the needle driver, approaching from either side depending on the chosen hand position for optimal bite orientation. The left hand uses fine tissue forceps at the wound margin to pick up and evert each edge. The bites remain close to the margin, symmetric, and consistent in depth, ensuring that the epidermal edges meet neatly. The needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin, and then regripped after passage for retrieval and reloading. After each pass, the suture is snugged just enough to bring the edges together; minor locking or securing throws are used to maintain progression without sacrificing the ability to continue moving up the incision. During this run, the suture is clearly serving both as a means of approximation and as a guide line to maintain straightness along the vertical axis.

As the work advances into the upper-middle segment, the pattern of alternating bites across the wound continues. The needle is poised just above the last completed throw, and the driver crosses the wound line to set up the next pass. The assisting hand intermittently stabilizes the tissue and, at times, captures the suture to prevent slack from obscuring the field. Bites are superficial and close to the margin, appropriate for a cutaneous closure on a practice pad. The suture is drawn through in smooth arcs, and the new segments tighten the approximation with each maneuver. When needed, the operator briefly secures the line with instrument throws—at times appearing like interrupted ties—to lock in the progress before continuing to the next bite. These securing moves are particularly evident in sequences where both hands hold needle drivers for a moment to tie and cinch a stitch down over the wound.

A particularly clear sequence shows the left hand elevating the near edge while the right hand enters with the needle driver above the last throw, then regrips near the tip to retrieve the needle on the opposite side. The suture is pulled through, and the strand is kept swept superiorly and laterally to maintain a clear workspace. The driver is then momentarily set aside while both hands manipulate the suture ends to tie a knot. The knot is advanced down to the wound with gentle, deliberate pressure, maintaining slight edge eversion. This yields an accurately approximated segment at the upper-middle portion of the incision.

Another pass shows the right hand positioned just superior-right of the incision, driving the needle across from left to right near the superior end. After the needle exits and is regripped, both hands pick up drivers and perform an instrument tie, placing a secure knot at the top of the wound segment being addressed. This sequence functions as a terminus for that stretch of closure, anchoring the work completed below it. It reads as a definitive tie-off at the superior end of the current working window, consistent with a plan to either end a running segment or to finish an interrupted placement at the topmost portion addressed in that moment.

The closure remains meticulously centered over the same vertical line. As the upper-middle gap narrows, the operator returns to passing a new stitch across this area, again with the forceps used intermittently to lift the right edge and present the dermis while the driver guides the needle through in a controlled arc. After pull-through, a suture loop lies visible superior to the bite, indicating readiness for either tensioning or the next move in the sequence. The flow demonstrates a careful balance between continuous advancement and periodic securing steps to ensure the approximation holds as the operator repositions for subsequent bites.

In the final minutes, the operator continues to work within millimeters of the upper-middle segment where a small residual gap persists. One sequence shows a completed pass with the suture drawn through and the needle parked away from the immediate field, leaving freshly approximated edges and improved alignment. The right hand crosses the wound to manage tension; the left hand sometimes withdraws to streamline the field or returns to manage the free strand or tissue. The movements remain crisp and confined, always oriented perpendicular or slightly oblique to the incision line for optimal needle trajectory and bite symmetry.

The last brief look shows a setup for the next bite: the needle is mounted in the driver at the distal third from the tip and presented from the patient’s right side, suggesting readiness to enter the near edge forehand. A cotton-tipped applicator or swab appears from the upper left and lightly contacts the central wound edges over previously placed stitches—likely used to sweep away fluid, clear debris, or gently position the tissue before the next pass. The operator’s head momentarily obscures the field, but the hands remain centered over the same wound, confirming that no other incision is being addressed. No new bite is taken in these closing frames; the scene ends with a poised setup and a tidy, nearly closed wound line.

Through the entire sequence, several technical themes remain consistent:

- Needle handling is deliberate. The needle is typically grasped at the proximal third to two-thirds from the tip, with entries held near 90 degrees to the skin. The driver releases and regrips during retrieval to maintain the natural curvature through the tissue, minimizing torque and tissue trauma. The needle is often parked between steps to reduce accidental pricks and to keep the field clean for tying.

- Tissue handling is gentle and mindful of eversion. The forceps lift the dermal edge with just enough purchase to present a target, avoiding excess crush. On some passes, the operator foregoes forceps and relies on suture tension and the arc of the needle to maintain edge visibility; at other times, forceps return to fine-tune eversion during needle entry and knot seating. Throughout, bites on both sides are kept symmetric in depth and distance from the margin, maintaining consistent edge meeting.

- Suture management is orderly. The free strand is often swept superior-laterally out of the working corridor to avoid entanglement. When tying, the operator alternates instrument roles as needed—sometimes using a single driver and a pickup, other times using two drivers to form loops and deliver the knot. Knot stacks are laid flat and cinched just enough to approximate without strangulation, with occasional trimming of tails to neaten the field.

- Spatial relationships are precise. The instruments straddle the incision, frequently working within 1–2 cm of the line. The driver crosses the wound for passes and then recrosses to retrieve or tie; the assisting hand hovers just ahead of the needle to ready the tissue and then falls back as the suture is drawn through. Even when the operator’s head or hand briefly obscures the camera, the instrument tips reappear at the same wound segment, underscoring the unwavering focus on a single closure line.

By the end of the observed sequence, the vertical incision is largely approximated from its inferior apex through the central segment and into the upper-middle region. Key knots are visible at the inferior corner, at the midline, and near the superior end of the currently addressed segment. The edges sit together with slight eversion and no obvious gapping across most of the line, while a very small residual interval in the upper-middle portion appears ready for the next bite. The cotton swab sweep and the poised needle orientation in the concluding frames suggest imminent continuation to finish closing that last remaining gap. Even if the absolute terminal knot is not captured before the clip ends, the wound has been brought into near-complete alignment with a sequence of carefully placed passes and well-controlled ties, all executed on the same single incision from bottom to top, with consistent technique, thoughtful hand positioning, and controlled suture handling.
