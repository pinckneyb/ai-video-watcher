COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure unfolds entirely on a single, straight vertical wound in the center of a three-incision practice pad. The lateral slits on the left and right remain unmanipulated from start to finish; every pass, tie, and cut occurs along the midline slit. The operator proceeds with a simple interrupted technique throughout, methodically building a line of evenly spaced, perpendicular stitches that approximate the entire length of the central wound.

Work begins at the midpoint of the central incision. The left hand holds the needle driver over the wound, and the right hand uses tissue forceps to gently evert the patient-right edge and present the dermis. The curved needle is loaded on the driver about two-thirds from the tip, oriented perpendicular to the skin. With controlled wrist rotation, the needle is advanced in an even, sweeping arc through the near edge and across to the far edge at a matched distance from the margin. Bites are symmetric, entering and exiting at consistent depth, and there is attention to maintaining the trajectory perpendicular to the wound to avoid oblique puncture or laddering. As the suture is drawn through, the driver transitions to tying; the right hand alternately manages the free end to begin the first instrument throws. Tension is balanced so the edges coapt without blanching or crush.

Immediately afterward, another pass is made along the same central wound. The right hand continues to control the needle driver, and the left hand now uses forceps to guide the needle tip and stabilize the opposing edge as needed. The needle is grasped on its proximal third with the driver and brought through each side of the incision with the same perpendicular orientation and smooth arc. Once through, the operator converts to tying. The suture limbs are crossed in front of the driver to form a loop, then cinched, alternating hands and direction to square the throws. Excess tail length is trimmed at the knot site, signifying closure of that stitch before moving on.

A third stitch is then placed still within the central wound. The needle is again grasped at the proximal third to midbody and driven with care to replicate symmetric entry and exit points. After this pass, the operator proceeds directly into an instrument-tie sequence. The driver works centrally above the wound, and the assisting hand manages the free strand to the side. Throws are formed and seated directly over the slit; tension is adjusted so the knot sits flush without sliding off the incision line. The technique consistently alternates the standing and free ends to seat a square, secure knot. If the needle remains on the long limb, it is kept parked outside the immediate field to avoid incidental puncture.

For the next segment, no new bites are taken—attention turns to securing and finishing a previously placed stitch at mid-incision. The right hand controls a needle driver (including a gold-handled driver at one point) over the center-right of the wound, serving purely as a tying instrument to grasp and guide the suture rather than the needle. The left hand alternates between holding a second driver or grasping the suture tail for tensioning. The wound edges, already approximated by the prior pass, are brought together incrementally as sequential throws are laid. The driver tips remain just above the incision center to square the knot, while the free end is pulled laterally and then across the wound to seat each throw centrally. Scissors are seen nearby but not used yet; they will be brought in once the knot is fully secured.

Knot tying continues over the same central spot, now with the right hand still over the incision using the driver to manipulate the suture, and the left hand briefly entering to retrieve scissors and manage the free end. The needle is left on the strand but kept out of the wound path. Throws are tightened and seated with careful, alternating tension; the knot remains centered and the edges stay naturally approximated. All activity remains confined to the middle slit with no contact to the lateral incisions.

With the core mid-portion stabilized, the operator initiates a new stitch at the lower half of the same central incision. The needle driver approaches from the upper-left relative to the wound, and the right hand uses forceps on the lower right edge to evert and control the tissue. The needle is loaded at the proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the pad. The pass is directed from the right edge across to the left, following a smooth curvature through the dermal plane. Entry and exit points mirror each other for ideal alignment. Once the needle has traversed both sides, the suture is pulled through, and attention turns to securing the stitch. Early knot throws are initiated, then successive throws are added in a controlled fashion so the knot sits directly over the gap created by the lower wound segment. Scissors are set aside for now; there is a continued focus on tensioning and seating each throw evenly.

This same lower stitch undergoes further tying. The needle remains attached to the long end and is parked to the patient-right. The needle driver holds the standing end centrally above the slit, while the opposite limb is alternately tensioned to seat the throws. Additional, carefully placed throws convert the initial tie into a stable knot, keeping the wound edges in gentle apposition without gapping or inversion.

The operator next completes another pass and tie in the mid-portion of the central incision. The needle is grasped about two-thirds from the tip, orthogonal to the skin surface. Following penetration, the right hand draws the suture through to equalize the ends, and the driver resumes a tying role to tension and square the knot. The pattern remains simple interrupted: one bite across the wound followed by a series of instrument-tie throws to lock the stitch over the line. No forceps are used here; the edges are held in alignment by the suture itself, confirming reliable depth and spacing.

Shifting slightly, another new interrupted stitch is placed in the lower portion of the same central wound. The left hand holds the driver and the right hand again uses tissue forceps just to the right of the slit to lift, stabilize, and evert the edge during passage. The needle is carried perpendicular to the surface, entering and exiting at balanced distances from the margin. After the pass, the suture is tightened gradually; then instrument ties are used to fix the knot squarely over the incision. The driver and forceps alternate roles as needed: first for needle delivery, then for securing the suture with controlled, sequential throws.

A similar sequence repeats on a neighboring site along the central line. The left hand with the driver advances the needle while the right hand with forceps assists in edge control; once the needle is through, it is parked and tying begins. The throws are stacked and seated carefully, with the right hand now also managing the free end. The wound edges are approximated by tension along the stitch rather than by direct grasp of the tissue; the closure maintains slight eversion and alignment.

The next few segments focus on tightening and finishing. The driver stays just above the wound line, controlling the standing end. The right hand crosses the incision with the free end to form loops and tighten. Multiple throws are formed and seated to secure the knots at mid-incision, ensuring each prior stitch is definitively locked. During these stages, the needle remains largely parked; there is no new tissue passage, only completion of the tying sequence and refinement of knot positions. The stitches remain oriented perpendicular to the incision, and each knot sits precisely over the wound to maintain even tension across the edges.

With the mid and lower portions now well established, the operator moves superiorly along the same central incision to close the upper segments. A new stitch is placed at the upper third. The right hand holds tissue forceps on the right wound edge to stabilize and gently evert, while the left hand advances the needle driver. The needle is grasped at the proximal third to midcurve and driven perpendicular to the skin, passing from the right edge toward the left. The driver follows the curvature, reorienting as needed to retrieve the needle. Bites are taken at a measured distance from the edge and mirrored across the midline, maintaining symmetrical depth. No traction is applied to the adjacent, unused incisions. As the suture is drawn across the gap, both hands maintain a controlled follow-through; the strand trails inferiorly, kept clear of the field.

Immediately adjacent to that superior pass, the operator places another stitch. The left hand maintains the driver over the superior segment, the right hand uses forceps to stabilize the right wound edge, and the needle is guided through both margins, again kept perpendicular. After the pass, the suture is drawn through to equalize lengths, setting up for tying. The driver remains centered just above the wound, and the assisting hand repositions slightly right/superior as the strand is pulled through.

These upper stitches are then secured. The dominant hand holds the driver over the superior end; the other hand manages the free suture end, alternately tensioning and guiding it next to the wound. The needle is not reinserted during these steps; instead, the driver and suture are used to complete instrument ties. Throws are formed sequentially and seated with alternating tension so the knot lies directly over the upper segment of the incision. The edges stay approximated and slightly everted by the tension on the stitch rather than by forceps.

Once a knot is secured near the top, the operator trims the tails. The driver is temporarily set aside; scissors are brought in and oriented perpendicular to the midline as the most recent knot is stabilized. The right hand maneuvers the cutting instrument to remove excess suture length without nicking the knot. The left hand is away from the field or resting off the pad, not providing countertraction during the cut. This trim confirms completion of one of the upper stitches.

Further tying at the superior portion follows with the driver working vertically over the incision. Forceps on the right side lightly stabilize the suture tail or the wound edge as loops are formed. The needle itself is not driven during this period; the focus remains on finishing the knot for the newly placed superior stitch. The loop arcs from left to right; by alternating traction between the standing and free ends, the knot is squared and cinched precisely over the wound.

Another upper knot is completed and trimmed. The driver is positioned just superior to the incision, perpendicular to the wound axis, to assist with loop formation and tightening. The right hand crosses in front of the driver to wrap and secure throws, then brings scissors in to trim when the knot is fully seated. With each trim, tails are kept appropriately short, leaving a neat, low-profile knot stack.

Near the top of the wound, one additional interrupted stitch is placed. Here, the operator works without forceps, using fingertips on the non-instrument hand to manage tension and alignment as the needle is passed. The driver holds the needle on its proximal-to-mid third and maintains a perpendicular approach as the needle traverses the right and left edges. The suture is drawn through and instrument ties are performed in sequence to secure the stitch. This blend of technique—precise needle driving with fingertip assistance for tissue stabilization—allows closure of the last small gap at the superior end while preserving gentle handling.

Finally, the very topmost knot is refined and its tails cut. The right hand enters repeatedly over the superior half with scissors or a driver repurposed as cutters, trimming the excess suture close to the knot. Throughout, no forceps are used during cutting; the wound edges remain unmanipulated, already held in approximation by the existing stitches. With the scissors perpendicular to the midline, each tail is snipped cleanly to finish the closure.

At the conclusion, there is a brief pause with no instrument-to-tissue interaction. Only the left, gloved hand is visible, resting off the pad; no needle, driver, suture, or scissors are in play. The central wound now shows a continuous row of simple interrupted stitches from the mid portion toward both lower and upper segments, with the superior region recently tied and trimmed. The edges are well approximated with symmetric bite spacing, consistent depth, and knots centered over the line. The lateral incisions have remained untouched for the duration.

Across the entire sequence, the technique remains consistent with simple interrupted suturing mechanics:

- Needle handling is meticulous. The needle is repeatedly grasped at the proximal third to midbody, kept perpendicular to the skin, and advanced with a controlled wrist arc that follows the curvature. Where regrasping occurs, it is performed deliberately to preserve the correct trajectory and retrieve the needle on the far side. When not in active use, the needle is “parked” safely on the strand, away from the field.

- Tissue handling is gentle and purposeful. When forceps are used, they lift and evert the edge lightly, grasping the dermal margin rather than crushing the epidermis. Bites are symmetric across the incision, both in distance from the edge and in depth. Even when forceps are not used, the operator relies on suture tension or fingertip stabilization to maintain alignment. There is no traction on any other incisions.

- Tying strategy is disciplined. Instrument ties are used almost universally. The driver is deployed as a tying tool over the wound to hold, loop, and seat the throws; the assisting hand manages the free end, moving lateral to the wound then crossing to lay each loop. Tension alternates between limbs to square each throw and seat the knot directly over the incision without sliding. Where two drivers appear, they oppose each other to form and square throws with excellent control. Knot security is established with multiple, sequential throws without over-tensioning.

- Spatial organization is clean. The driver usually remains centered over the incision; the forceps often work just lateral to the wound on the patient-right side, especially during needle passage. Hands oppose each other across the wound, converging over the center during tying. Loops arc over the wound in a predictable pattern, and suture tails are kept short after trimming. Instruments never stray to the lateral slits, and there is no crossing over unrelated incisions.

- Progress follows a logical course along the same wound. The closure starts at the middle of the central slit, with early stitches placed and tied, then moves to the lower half to approximate that gap, and ultimately advances to the superior portion. Each new pass is followed by careful knot construction and, when appropriate, trimming. Upper stitches are added and secured last, with the final acts consisting of tightening and cutting, followed by a pause that suggests completion or a brief rest with the wound well coapted.

By the end, the central vertical incision is spanned by a neatly organized series of simple interrupted sutures. The edges are coapted without step-offs, eversion is modest and consistent, and knot stacks are compact with appropriately trimmed tails. Instrument handling is controlled and efficient, with predictable transitions from needle driving to tying to cutting. The uninterrupted focus on the central slit, combined with the consistent instrumentation and suture mechanics, yields a stable, methodical closure completed in discrete, well-executed steps.
