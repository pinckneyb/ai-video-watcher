COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure begins with careful orientation of instruments and deliberate planning focused on the short horizontal slit near the superior edge of the practice pad. From the first frames the surgeon and assistant position themselves around that topmost small incision: one hand with a needle driver and the other with tissue forceps, both hovering over the right and left margins of the slit as they prepare to take controlled dermal bites. The curved, swaged needle is consistently picked up with the driver in a variety of grips throughout the case (mid‑shaft, about two‑thirds from the tip, sometimes more proximal near the swage), but in every pass the needle is oriented approximately perpendicular to the skin surface before it is driven through tissue. The technique adopted is straightforward, methodical interrupted suturing with attention to edge eversion and even spacing.

0:00–0:14 — The very first actions show the needle positioned to enter the right wound margin. The right‑side forceps lifts and everts the dermal edge while the left‑handed driver advances from the operator’s left toward the right. The needle is placed a few millimeters from the epidermal edge and passed through the dermis. This initial entry constitutes the first bite of a new stitch; the strand trails away from the wound to maintain working length and visibility.

0:15–0:29 — Work shifts slightly to concentrate on the left end of the same superior slit. Hands reverse roles at times: a left‑handed driver operates over the left wound edge and a right hand with forceps stabilizes and everts tissue. The needle is grasped roughly two‑thirds from the tip, oriented near perpendicular, and driven through the epidermis and dermis with controlled rotation following the curve. After passage the driver is regrasped to retrieve the tip; the suture is drawn through to establish adequate tail length. At this stage the operator is creating the complementary bite across the aperture to complete the through‑and‑through passage needed for a simple interrupted pattern.

0:30–0:44 — Early frames indicate some activity around a lower horizontal incision (instrument ties and knot formation). Those actions appear limited to finishing previously passed sutures and do not represent the line receiving systematic new stitches for the remainder of the procedure. The team maintains attention on the superior slit as primary work continues, while the lower wound remains already partly closed with existing interrupted sutures.

0:45–0:59 — An established stitch at the top slit is now being secured. The needle driver holds the curved needle in a supporting position while the opposite instrument manipulates the suture loop and tail, forming instrument throws. Hands cross above the right half of the incision as alternating throws are created and cinched down, approximating edges with gentle tension and preserving eversion. This first knot is seated on the skin surface and scissors are introduced to trim the short tails, leaving tidy standing ends.

1:00–1:14 — The surgeon advances to a new bite at the left end again. A right‑hand needle driver repositions, reloading the needle near its proximal third so that the curvature, rotation and perpendicular approach remain consistent. Forceps tent and present the dermal edge; the needle is driven in an arc and retrieved with an assistant’s forceps to pull the suture through. No knot tying occurs in this brief sequence — the operator is establishing each through‑and‑through pass preparatory to subsequent tying.

1:15–1:29 — Activity continues on the superior slit with the surgeon working at its left end. After passing the needle, the assistant briefly seizes the tip with forceps to complete the pull‑through and to prevent inadvertent tissue drag. The suture is tensioned and left ready for tying; the team consistently adopts an approach of taking paired bites and then returning to form and secure each interrupted knot before moving laterally.

1:30–1:44 — A similar pattern repeats: the needle is grasped at the proximal third, rotated along its curve, and driven through one side of the slit into the dermis. Forceps present the opposite edge for the reciprocal pass. The operator keeps suture tails and loops organized, maintaining control of slack while preparing to seat another knot.

1:45–1:59 — The surgeon prepares an anchoring bite on intact skin just superior to the slit in one sequence. This transit or anchor bite secures the suture and provides better control for subsequent passes; the driver punctures intact tissue above the wound to create a stable point for the suture strand. Throughout these steps the driver’s grip is adjusted (sometimes more distal, sometimes more proximal) to maintain the ideal needle angle and arc.

2:00–2:14 — Hands remain paired and coordinated; the driver is centered above the slit and the forceps work on the right wound edge. The needle is loaded and driven into the right edge with deliberate perpendicular orientation, and the forceps gently evert to present the dermis. The initial bite of a new stitch is established, and the suture drawn through carefully to avoid over‑tensioning.

2:15–2:29 — The surgeon completes another through‑and‑through pass across the slit, regrasping and repositioning the needle as necessary. The assistant intermittently manipulates the free end of the suture to maintain appropriate tension and to present an organized working field. The pattern of “bite, pull through, regrasp, prepare reciprocal pass” becomes the repeating rhythm of the repair.

2:30–2:44 — A single interrupted stitch is again formed and tied on the top slit. The needle driver holds the working end while the assistant forms instrument throws with a second driver or forceps; alternating throws are applied, the knot is seated with controlled tension, and scissors trim the tails. Throughout the tying the wound edges remain neatly approximated and everted, with minimal blanching observed.

2:45–2:59 — The right side of the small slit receives additional attention. The driver approaches from the superior‑right and, after needle passage, the assistant pulls the strand through from the lateral side, managing slack and aligning the suture for tying. Minimal use of forceps for eversion is noted in some passes; the team relies at times on suture tension and driver control to maintain edge apposition when forceps are momentarily withdrawn.

3:00–3:14 — As the session progresses, there is clear evidence of a systematic lateral progression: an anchor or first stitch toward the left is followed by sequential bites toward the right side of the slit. When the driver is operated from the right, forceps oppose from the left; when the driver is on the left, the forceps oppose on the right. This alternating, mirrored positioning ensures perpendicular needle entry and symmetric tissue purchase on both sides of each bite.

3:15–3:29 — Midway through the case, the team makes small adjustments to hand configuration. Occasionally the nondominant hand assumes needle‑driver duties while the dominant hand provides the tissue control with forceps; these role reversals are managed smoothly and keep the needle trajectory optimal. Needle grips continue to vary between mid‑shaft, two‑thirds from the tip, and near the swage depending on whether the operator is initiating a pass, completing one, or reloading for a reciprocal bite.

3:30–3:44 — In later passes the surgeon frequently repositions the suture tail with the left hand while the right maintains the driver, or vice versa; this alternating manipulation helps advance sutures along the slit without entanglement and keeps each stitch individually manageable. The surgeon forms instrument ties over the driver as needed, using the driver as a post during knot formation when appropriate.

3:45–3:59 — When tying, the two hands cross above the incision at modest angles (often 30–60 degrees), with the driver holding the suture steady and the opposite instrument wrapping the loop to produce alternating throws. Knots are cinched down to anatomic apposition with gentle but firm traction to avoid tissue strangulation. Scissors are reintroduced as needed to trim the tails short after knots are secured.

4:00–4:14 — A few sequences show brief, focused activity at the far right end of the slit. A bite placed there is pulled across and prepared for tying; the instrument geometry remains close and parallel to the wound with the driver tending to approach from the right and the forceps opposing from the left, consistent with earlier technique.

4:15–4:29 — Occasionally, the needle is used as an anchor or the driver is held steady while suture loops are formed; the assistant’s role in controlling the free end of the suture is constant and deliberate. There is attention to even spacing between stitches and to maintaining a consistent suture depth through the dermis so that tissue approximation is uniform along the length of the slit.

4:30–4:44 — As the case approaches its end, the operator secures the final interrupted stitch on the top slit. Knot security and final approximation are confirmed; scissors are used to trim tails flush with the knot to leave a neat, low profile finish.

4:45–4:59 — The final frames show a still field over the superior slit with knots in place and short tails remaining. All bites across the small horizontal slit have been passed and secured with interrupted sutures. The wound edges are neatly approximated, everted, and lie in a straight line consistent with proper dermal purchase.

Throughout the entire sequence the needle handling remains precise: the instrument is consistently reoriented to achieve a near‑perpendicular entry, rotated along the curve to follow a smooth, controlled arc, and regrasped as needed to complete passage or to remove the needle from the opposite margin. Tissue handling is gentle — forceps are used to tent and evert the epidermal edges to optimize dermal apposition while minimizing crush injury, and suture tension is kept sufficient to approximate edges without blanching. Knot technique is ringed instrument tying with alternating throws; on several occasions the driver serves as the post while the assistant forms throws with a second instrument. Scissors are intermittently introduced from the image left or right to trim tails once knots are secured.

Two observations occasionally conflict with this continuous sequence: at several time points there are isolated episodes of instrument tying on the lower, longer horizontal incision and frames that show multiple already‑placed stitches along that inferior wound. These lower‑wound actions are limited to completing previously started stitches and trimming or seating knots rather than representing a shift of technique focus away from the superior slit. They do not interrupt the steady progression of bites, knots, and tail trimming on the superior small slit, which is the focus of the closure maneuvers across the entire recording.

By the conclusion, the short superior slit is fully approximated with a serial set of evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures. Knots have been alternately thrown, snugly seated, and the suture tails have been trimmed close to the knots. The skin edges along the slit are everted and aligned, with minimal tissue blanching, consistent depth of dermal purchase, and tidy low‑profile knots. The lower long incision remains with preexisting interrupted sutures along most of its length and shows no further active passes during the latter part of the recording; a small gap near the right end of that lower line appears unchanged in the final idle frames. Instruments are withdrawn and left idle adjacent to the field as the team steps back, leaving a neatly closed superior slit and an inferior wound that retains the previously completed sutures.
