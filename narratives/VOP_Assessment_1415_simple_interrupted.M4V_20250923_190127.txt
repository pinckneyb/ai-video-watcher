COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a synthetic skin pad with multiple straight, parallel vertical slits visible in the field. From the outset the operator concentrates on one of these slits and stays with it throughout, building a single, coherent line of closure from its mid-portion up toward the superior end. Because the camera periodically reframes and the neighboring cuts drift in and out of view, the target wound appears at times to be central in the frame, at other times just left of center, and occasionally it reads as the leftmost slit. Despite these shifts in perspective, the hands, instruments, and suture all consistently return to and advance along the same wound line.

The work begins with a straightforward setup for an interrupted skin stitch in the mid-section of this line. A needle driver approaches with the curved needle grasped on the proximal third of its body, the driver’s jaws perpendicular to the curve so the needle can follow its arc cleanly. The tip is presented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface. Opposite the driver, tissue forceps stabilize the near wound edge and gently evert the dermis to expose an ideal entry point. The entry is taken on one lip and the needle is guided across the incision in a controlled pronation–supination motion, emerging on the far side at a symmetric distance from the cut edge. The forceps alternate sides to control the exit and prevent tearing, while the driver briefly releases and re-grasps the needle to complete the passage following the needle’s curvature. The suture pulls through smoothly, the strand trailing away from the field to avoid tangles.

With that first midline pass across the skin established, attention shifts immediately to securing it. The needle, kept safely under control on the driver, is parked while the instrument tie sequence begins. The driver now functions as a knot pusher and grasper for the standing limb, while the assisting hand with pickups manages the free end near the wound. Multiple throws are formed deliberately over the incision, each loop laid neatly and snugged down to seat the knot flat over the epidermis. The hands cross above the wound as needed to maintain proper directionality of the throws and to counteract any tendency of the knot to drift to one side. During this phase the needle itself is not passed; instead, the focus is on tightening and locking the knot over the existing stitch. The forceps do not crush tissue; they only steady the edge as tension is applied, letting the suture itself approximate the wound edges. The loops are guided down with the tips of the driver, then tensioned alternately on the long and short limbs until the knot lies squarely. Scissors remain on the field but are not yet used; the tails are held for subsequent throws. Throughout, the strand is kept off the working area, arcing to one side so the view of the wound stays clear.

Once the midline stitch is secured, the operator completes any remaining throws with methodical instrument tying. At moments, two needle drivers are used to facilitate a precise, symmetric lay of the knot, one instrument managing the standing limb and the other the free end. This two-driver technique allows for a vertical, co-axial advance of the knot so it seats exactly where intended. The pickups reappear as needed to gently evert an edge while a throw is snugged, then are set aside again. With the knot stable and the edges neatly apposed, the right-hand scissors come in to trim the tails to an appropriate length. The knot now sits cleanly over the center of the wound, and the entry and exit punctures are equidistant from the cut line.

With that foundation set, the closure advances toward the superior segment. The needle is reloaded in the driver’s jaws at the proximal third, curve oriented perpendicular to the skin, and the field is re-established: the driver positions just superior to the next target site, and the forceps oppose it across the wound. The assisting hand uses Adsons or fine pickups to tent the dermis and promote slight eversion, presenting a crisp, vertical target for the next bite. As before, the needle follows its curvature through the near edge and out the far side, the driver reorienting as needed to bring the tip through along a perpendicular track. The spacing is consistent with the prior stitch—shallow enough for epidermal approximation but deep enough to gain purchase in the simulated dermis, and symmetrically placed on both lips. The suture is then drawn through, the long limb kept elevated and away from the pad, creating a tidy loop over the incision.

Knotting again becomes the focus. The driver releases the needle and transitions into tie mode. The forceps intermittently touch the near edge to steady it as each throw is advanced. Instrument ties are executed with the same steady cadence as before, each throw set down in the same location with vertical guidance of the driver so the knot builds directly above the incision without lateral creep. The knot is seated and locked with successive throws; only after the knot is stable do the scissors appear to trim the tails. The wound edges beneath each completed knot show slight eversion and precise approximation.

This rhythm—precise placement of a bite across the wound followed by controlled instrument tying—repeats as the operator marches upward along the same slit. There are moments when the camera cropping makes the active wound appear central in the field or even leftmost compared to adjacent cuts, but the handling pattern and the accumulated knot stack anchor the viewer to the same line. The suture line displays consistent spacing of entry and exit points and uniform depth, with the needle always loaded near its proximal third to optimize sweeping control of the arc. The driver approaches from slightly superior or slightly lateral depending on the available working angle, but in every instance the needle is brought to the skin perpendicular to the surface. The pickups are used with a light touch—just enough to evert and expose, never crushing or excessively pinching.

As the closure reaches into the upper half of this slit, the technique remains faithful to simple interrupted suturing. In one brief interval the partially closed row presents the visual impression of a short continuous segment because several bites lie close together with the strand temporarily spanning between them while the next pass is prepared. Nevertheless, the operator continues to pause after each passage to perform instrument ties, locking each stitch independently before moving on. Where the visualization suggests “running,” the hand choreography tells the true story: the driver parks the needle, the assisting hand controls one limb, and the throws are laid and snugged down over the same point, confirming interrupted technique. This careful knot-by-knot progression prevents suture line creep and maintains consistent edge eversion.

Approaching the superior end, the driver often comes in from the top edge of the field, hovering directly over the apex of the slit. The assisting forceps work just lateral to the target entry site, typically along the right margin for a right-to-left bite across the wound. The needle is presented with the tip a millimeter or two above the intended entry, then pressed in with a smooth pronation of the wrist so the arc carries it through the near lip, across the gap, and out the far lip at an equivalent offset. To complete the passage cleanly, the driver briefly releases and re-grasps the needle on the emerging side, rotating it so that the force applied remains coaxial with the curve of the needle. The suture is pulled through, again kept elevated in a graceful arc over the field to avoid snagging on existing knots.

With each new stitch placed near the top, instrument ties recommence. The driver holds the standing part while the opposing hand either uses pickups to deliver the free end or simply fingers the suture to create the loop. The throws are formed deliberately—first a securing throw to anchor the knot, then alternating throws to lock it. The forceps may briefly touch the near edge to refine apposition as the knot cinches down. Scissors sometimes remain idle nearby, then are brought in at the end to trim. The process is unhurried, ensuring that tension is distributed evenly so no puckering or inversion occurs.

At points, the operator reloads the needle multiple times outside the tissue. This is done to adjust the angle of approach so the next bite can be taken perpendicular to the surface and orthogonal to the incision line, especially important as the row nears the apex where access is tighter. While reloading, the suture is managed to prevent entanglement; the assisting hand lifts the strand or nudges prior knots to keep the working field tidy. Whenever a new needle–suture is introduced—as happens once the previously used strand is fully consumed—the driver immediately assumes control near the working end, and the forceps steady the opposite lip, maintaining the same geometry and spacing as before. This transition is smooth and does not interrupt the cadence of placement and tying.

In the mid-to-upper segment, the right hand occasionally switches roles: when the left hand holds the driver, the right hand’s pickups guide the needle tip and help retrieve it on the far side; in other sequences the right hand holds the driver while the left hand lifts the near edge. This ambidextrous switching preserves ergonomic access and keeps the passes perpendicular even when the angle of attack changes. The driver’s approach varies—sometimes superior-left, sometimes superior-right—but the fundamental spatial relationship persists: instruments oppose each other across the slit, meeting above the wound to control the passage and the knot.

As the closure reaches the very superior end of the slit, the setup for the next interrupted stitch is again evident. The needle is loaded at approximately its proximal third and held nearly perpendicular to the incision; the forceps gently evert the left edge near the apex. The driver hovers just to the right of centerline, aligned for a right-to-left pass that will capture the final open segment. In these moments the suture may be used as a gentle retractor to elevate the wound line slightly, aligning both edges and clarifying the depth plane for entry. Even when a pass is not completed within a given moment, the preparation—precise needle orientation, controlled elevation of the tissue edge, careful positioning of the driver—demonstrates a consistent approach that has been used throughout.

Interspersed among these placement sequences are brief but important episodes of line management. After certain stitches are placed and tied, the operator returns to previous knots to gently tension the line, ensuring that each segment remains evenly approximated. The forceps touch the dermis away from the margin to avoid damaging the edge itself while lifting slightly to check eversion. The driver may tilt a knot stack to one side to verify that skin edges are flush. When tails need trimming, the scissors come in from the right or left, blue-handled in some views, and make concise cuts, leaving tidy, consistently sized ends.

Throughout, the suture strand is carefully managed: it arcs to the right in some sequences, to the left in others, but it is always kept clear of the wound and instruments. When the strand risks looping over a knot or edge, the assisting hand lifts it with the pickups and repositions it. The working distances are short, the instruments stay close to the incision, and the field remains uncluttered.

By the time the work reaches the apex, the wound exhibits a neat row of evenly spaced, simple interrupted stitches marching from the mid-portion to the top. Each knot sits centrally over the incision with its tails trimmed. Entry and exit punctures are equidistant from the cut edge, and the bite depths are symmetric. The wound edges lie in intimate apposition with a subtle, desirable eversion; there is no evidence of gapping between stitches and no inversion that would compromise healing. Adjacent slits—visible intermittently to the right and left—remain untouched except where the camera angle makes the target slit appear as if it has shifted position relative to them. The technique from start to finish is consistent: needle held at the proximal third, near-perpendicular entry and exit, controlled re-grasp for completion of the arc, precise instrument ties laid directly over each stitch, and careful strand and tail management. Even in the one period where the partially completed row briefly resembles a continuous segment, the operator’s repeated tying and trimming confirm adherence to the same interrupted method used everywhere else.

The final state is a well-closed linear wound with a uniform series of interrupted knots spanning the treated segment. The superior end has been addressed with the same care as the midpoint: bites at consistent offset and depth, a knot seated squarely, and tails trimmed. The instruments withdraw leaving the line flat, orderly, and tensioned just enough to approximate without blanching. The procedure’s progression—from first midline pass, through sequential bites and instrument ties, to the final preparations and placements at the apex—reflects a disciplined, reproducible approach to interrupted skin closure on a training pad, executed with sound needle handling, respectful tissue management, and clear, consistent spatial control over the same wound line throughout.
