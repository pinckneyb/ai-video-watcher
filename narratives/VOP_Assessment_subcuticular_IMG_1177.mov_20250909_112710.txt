Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
You demonstrate disciplined instrument control, consistent 90‑degree needle driving, and careful, atraumatic forceps use. Knot construction is methodical and secure. However, this performance does not meet subcuticular standards: the working plane repeatedly exits the dermis with multiple epidermal breaches and on‑line external knots, and there is no continuous intradermal progression. For a proper subcuticular closure, select the horizontal dermal plane just deep to the epidermis and keep the needle shallow, traveling parallel to the skin. Start with a buried intradermal anchor (deep‑dermal to dermal or a lateral buried knot), then advance with equal bite length and depth (about 4–6 mm step length, 2–3 mm from the epidermis) so each exit mirrors the prior entry at the same dermal level. Maintain gentle, even tension to prevent ridging, and finish with a buried Aberdeen or lateral buried knot off the line; no external knots or cross‑skin punctures. Until you can keep every pass in the dermis and deliver a smooth, flat surface without track marks, this will not pass as a subcuticular closure.
