COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure opens on a three‑incision silicone training pad. The right‑most vertical slit—running along the pad’s right margin—is selected for closure and remains the single line of interest throughout. The other two slits (central and left) appear untouched at the outset. Work begins at the inferior end of this right‑side wound with the classic two‑handed setup: the right hand on a needle driver and the left on Adson tissue forceps. The needle is loaded two‑thirds from the tip, oriented nearly perpendicular to the skin surface to optimize the curve’s natural sweep through the dermis. The left hand presents and gently everts the wound edge while the right hand follows the needle’s arc across the gap. This first bite establishes the anchor at the base of the incision; at this early stage there are no completed stitches yet—just the initial pass and tensioning of the strand to seat it.

As the needle arcs through and the thread is drawn through the wound, the first knot is constructed at the inferior end using instrument ties. The right hand maintains control of the standing end with the driver, while the left hand manages the free end of the suture to lay down alternating throws. Scissors are then brought in from the right, tails are trimmed to a safe length, and the knot is seated flush to the wound edge without strangulating tissue. By the close of this phase, exactly one completed stitch (the anchored knot stack) is visible at the lower portion of the right‑most slit. With the anchor secured, the needle is reloaded for continued closure superiorly along the same line.

The operator then prepares the next pass just above the anchor. The left hand returns to the forceps to grasp the epidermal‑dermal margin, applying just enough traction to evert the edge without crushing. The right hand, with the needle driver, advances the curved needle from the near/right side toward the far/left side of the incision in a controlled, perpendicular arc. After partial passage, the needle is regripped to complete the exit on the opposite edge. The suture is pulled through to remove slack, and the bite is seated to approximate the edges. In these moments the camera view is tight on the new work, so previously tied material is not always visible; nevertheless, the previously anchored stitch at the base remains in place while this new pass is executed. The spacing is short and even, consistent with skin closure on synthetic material.

The hands work in a stable triangle: forceps directly opposing the driver across the wound, with the suture arc forming the third side of the triangle. The driver’s wrist supination and pronation follow the needle’s curvature, minimizing lateral shear and reducing tissue trauma. After each pass, the needle is retrieved, reloaded at roughly the proximal third to maintain 90‑degree orientation, and then presented for the next bite. Throughout this sequence, scissors rest idle off to the right except when needed to trim tails after knotting.

A brief segment shows the same right‑side work continuing near the inferior third with the left hand alternating between forceps and directly handling the needle/suture to facilitate an instrument tie. A loop is formed and manipulated with the driver to seat the throw precisely at the wound margin. Although knot completion is not always visible within each short sequence, the technique remains controlled: edges are approximated with balanced tension and slight eversion, and slack is removed without excessive traction.

There is a short interlude in which the camera frames the central slit and positions a needle for a first bite on that middle incision. This appears to be a momentary demonstration or setup shot rather than a change in the actual closure being performed. Importantly, no sustained closure is carried through on the central wound in the larger sequence, and the continuous narrative of closure resumes on the same right‑most slit immediately afterward. For counting and continuity, the ongoing closure remains exclusively on the right‑side incision.

Returning to the right margin wound, the next series of frames shows that the inferior and mid‑segments now display two discrete knot stacks from earlier work. This is a common finding in training sequences when the initial anchor is reinforced or when a prior interrupted demonstration has been incorporated at the base before proceeding with a running line. Regardless of how the anchor was established, the technique from this point forward is advanced as a continuous run superiorly. The left hand with forceps stabilizes the far (left) edge as the right hand drives the needle from the near/right side across to the far side. Small, symmetric dermal bites are taken, and the suture is pulled through and tensioned in the line. The opposite edge is handled with minimal trauma: just enough purchase with the teeth of the forceps to present and evert the margin.

Near the upper third of the wound, the needle is again advanced and regripped to complete passage. The suture is drawn through, slack is removed, and the new loop in the running line is seated. Although the final knot is not tied in these frames, the closure plainly transitions into a running pattern—successive passes are made without cutting the needle end—and the line visibly lengthens. By the time the camera widens to reveal more of the right‑edge incision, several completed loops (not individual knot stacks) are evident along the inferior and mid‑portions, with four completed stitches visible along the line at once. The inferior portion is well approximated and shows steady spacing of the loops, while active work occurs just above that.

The operator’s technique is consistent: forceps in the left hand delicately evert the working edge and receive the needle upon exit; the needle driver in the right hand maintains the perpendicular needle angle and controls the arc; and after each pass, the needle is reloaded mid‑body for optimal control. The operator pulls the free strand away from the wound to maintain line tension and prevent the loops from loosening as the work migrates superiorly. The running line progresses bite by bite, and the count of completed loops increases predictably. At this stage, four completed stitches are visible along the closure while a fifth is being fashioned at the superior end.

As the closure approaches the top of the slit, the wound edges remain everted and the dermal margins are brought into even contact. The left hand occasionally switches from forceps to direct finger control of the edge or suture to fine‑tune traction. In one section, an assistant or a second instrument appears on the right to help manage the free strand, providing counter‑tension while the primary driver completes the pass—an efficient method to keep the running line snug and the field orderly. Despite these hand alternations, the spatial relationship remains constant: driver laterally on the pad’s right border, forceps medially to the left of the incision, instruments opposed across the wound, and the needle presented perpendicular to the skin.

With additional passes near the upper portion, the cumulative number of completed loops increases. At one point, the camera view is broad enough to document six completed stitches along the right‑side slit, reflecting the steady superior advance of the continuous run. The inferior and middle loops hold the wound edges apposed with slight eversion and uniform spacing, while the active pass is set up just beyond them. Tension is controlled by drawing the suture across the incision toward the operator’s left, seating each loop before the next bite is taken.

As the work nears the end of the wound, the camera zooms in to the upper segment. In this narrow view, only three completed loops are visible at once—simply a function of framing rather than a change in the closure. The technique remains unchanged: the left hand uses Adsons to lift the edge and guide the needle exit; the right hand positions the needle at roughly a right angle to the skin, follows the curve through the near and far edges, and then regrips to pull through. The suture is directed superiorly and laterally, removing slack in the line and protecting the previously seated loops from being inadvertently loosened.

The final frames depict end‑stage management. The needle is not actively traversing the tissue; instead, it is parked securely in the silicone pad at the right‑superior quadrant while the operator controls the strand and prepares to terminate the line. The left hand, positioned just superior‑left of the incision, keeps gentle traction on the free suture to maintain approximation. The right hand introduces scissors from the right, crossing over the superior end of the wound to cut the suture. Hands remain opposed across the line during this maneuver, preserving control and avoiding accidental loosening of the last loop. Importantly, no new bites are taken in this closing sequence; it is purely the finish—controlling the strand, protecting the approximation, and trimming.

Throughout the procedure, the technique is a continuous running closure proceeding from the inferior to the superior end of the right‑side slit. Early in the sequence, an anchor was established at the base—visible as a knot stack and accompanying tail—after which the operator continued with uninterrupted passes. In the midcourse, two knot stacks are visible in the lower/mid segment, a feature occasionally seen in training where an initial interrupted demonstration is converted to, or incorporated into, a running line; nevertheless, the method deployed thereafter is consistently continuous. Bite placement is careful and symmetric, needle entry angles are maintained near 90 degrees with true follow‑through of the curve, and forceps use is gentle, favoring dermal purchase rather than crushing grips. Regrasping the needle mid‑pass is used to complete the arc smoothly, and suture tensioning is performed in the line direction to set each loop before advancing.

Hand positions evolve only as needed to facilitate exposure and tension control. The left hand primarily wields the forceps, everting and presenting the far edge and occasionally managing the free strand or using fingers for fine tactile control. The right hand carries the needle driver throughout, advancing the needle and then, when necessary, using scissors to cut tails. A second instrument sometimes assists on the right to apply counter‑tension on the running strand. Spatially, the hands remain opposite each other across the wound, working along the incision’s axis; the driver approaches from the right border of the pad and the forceps from the left, maintaining a steady working triangle above the field.

Suture progression and counting can be tracked across the sequence. The series begins with no completed stitches visible as the anchor bite is taken. That anchor is then tied, yielding 1 completed stitch at the inferior end. Additional passes are placed above, initially with two discrete knot stacks visible in the lower half while the running line develops. As the operator advances, four completed running loops are seen along the line; shortly thereafter, a fifth loop is in progress at the superior end. With further progress the camera captures a view showing six completed loops along the closure. In the final, tight, superiorly focused frames—where no new bites are taken and the needle is parked—the field shows four completed stitches visible along the segment being cut. The difference in the number seen late versus mid‑sequence reflects the camera’s zoomed framing rather than a loss of closure below; the earlier loops lie inferiorly, outside the last field of view.

Final state and verification:
- The closure ends at the superior end of the right‑most vertical slit with the needle parked in the pad and the free strand cut under controlled tension.
- In the last frames, exactly 4 completed stitches are visible in the field, evenly spaced across the upper/mid portion of the incision.
- Over the course of the procedure, the count increased from 0 (initial bite) to 1 (anchored base), then to multiple completed running loops—documented as 4 during mid‑closure, and at one point as many as 6 when the camera captured a broader segment—before the final close‑up view shows 4 visible at termination.
- The wound edges along the visible segment are well approximated with slight eversion, and loop spacing is consistent.

In sum, the surgeon performs a continuous running skin closure on the right‑most incision, anchored at the inferior end and advanced steadily toward the superior end. Forceps are used judiciously to evert and present tissue; the needle is driven perpendicularly with controlled arcs and regrips; suture tension is carefully managed to seat each loop without strangulation. A brief mid‑sequence shot of the central slit appears but does not alter the continuity of the closure being completed on the right‑side wound. The procedure culminates with strand control and trimming at the top of the slit. The procedure resulted in 4 completed sutures visible in the final frames, with additional loops likely present inferiorly but out of the final field of view.
