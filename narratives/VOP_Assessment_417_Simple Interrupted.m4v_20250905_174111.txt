Pattern: Simple Interrupted



Summative assessment:
Your motion and flow are disciplined: you load the needle correctly, present perpendicular, park the needle safely, and execute instrument ties with a steady, repeatable rhythm. Strand management is organized, tension is applied along the wound axis, and knots are seated cleanly with centered placement and controlled trimming.

To sharpen this from strong to exemplary, explicitly demonstrate symmetric, 90-degree entries and exits on both edges with consistent bite depth, and show clear, intentional eversion after each knot is set. Standardize throw count and tail length, minimize any unnecessary instrument exchanges, and verify spacing within the 0.5â€“1.0 cm window across the run to remove any doubt about uniformity. This is competent, safe work; tighten the details to make it unimpeachable.
