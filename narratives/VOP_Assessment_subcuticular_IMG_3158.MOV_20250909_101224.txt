Pattern: Subcuticular

Summative assessment:
This attempt demonstrates basic instrument control and gentle handling, but it does not achieve a subcuticular closure. The line shows repeated full-thickness punctures rather than a continuous dermal path, and the incision is left without any completed sutures at the end. As a result, there is no functional closure and no secure start or finish consistent with subcuticular standards. To meet standard, anchor with a buried dermal knot at one end, then proceed with a true intradermal run: equal 3–5 mm bite length, 1–2 mm from the epidermis, constant depth, and mirrored entries/exits within the dermis while maintaining even, modest tension to lay the skin flat without ridging. Finish with an appropriate buried knot (or equivalent secure termination) and confirm uniform approximation. Improve efficiency by keeping the needle consistently loaded at the proximal third, minimizing unnecessary hand switching, planning spacing before starting, and avoiding redundant steps that do not advance the closure.
