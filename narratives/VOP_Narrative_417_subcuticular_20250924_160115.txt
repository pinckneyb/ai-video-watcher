COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure follows a single vertical wound on the right side of the practice pad from initial engagement at the inferior end through progressive closure moving cephalad. At the outset (0–14 s) the lower end of that right-sided vertical slit is the working site. The assistant’s left hand holds the needle driver with the curved needle grasped in the proximal third of its arc, oriented roughly perpendicular to the skin. The right hand holds fine tissue forceps on the right wound margin, lifting and everting the dermal edge. The operator drives the needle into the right edge about 2–3 mm from the margin, beginning a new stitch; the suture is drawn through but the opposing bite and any knot have not yet been completed in these first frames.

From 15–44 s the team consolidates the first pass and begins to secure it. Hands remain close about the inferior tip of the same right-of-center slit: the right hand continues to control the forceps and the short free end while the left-hand driver is used to wrap and secure throws. The needle is not seen passing during much of this segment—rather the driver is used to form instrument ties and cinch down the stitch already passed. The tissue edges come together as tension is applied; the left driver positions and tightens the knot while the right hand provides counter‑tension with forceps or the free strand. These frames show the initial stitch being tied and seated at the inferior end of the incision.

Between 45–74 s the pattern repeats for adjacent consecutive bites at the same lower portion of the wound. Early in this interval the curved needle is present at the inferior end and the left driver approaches from the upper-left while the right forceps come from the right. The operator repositions and prepares another pass; then, as noted later in the interval, the needle is parked and instrument ties are performed to secure previously placed passes. Throughout, the needle is typically grasped two‑thirds from the tip or about its mid-body when being advanced; when knots are being formed the driver is used to wrap and grasp the free strand. Instrument positions remain in a tight working triangle immediately over the lower end of the right-sided slit.

Frames at 75–104 s show continued knotting and controlled tying down of stitches already placed near the inferior third of the slit. The right-hand driver often holds the needle or a parked needle adjacent to the wound while the left-hand driver alternately forms loops and pulls the free end through. Tissue is not aggressively manipulated during these throws; the suture tension approximates the edges and seats the knot on the wound surface. By the end of these frames, a secure base of closure has been formed in the most inferior segment of the right-of-center incision.

From 105–134 s the operator advances along this same vertical line. The left hand resumes driving the curved needle, regrasping it near the proximal third, while the right forceps again evert the wound edge and at times regrasp the needle tip to reload it. A new bite is taken through one edge and pulled across to the opposing edge; slack is cleared and the needle is reloaded for the next pass. The hands are oppositional across the incision—driver on the left, forceps on the right—and work within a few millimeters of the margin with the suture loop lying over the midline of the cut. In these frames the technique demonstrates transition from isolated interrupted-style securing at the inferior tip to more serial placement of bites up the same line.

Between 135–164 s the team performs further knotting and securing of a stitch placed at the inferior third while simultaneously preparing to continue superiorly. The right hand holds a needle driver over the right side of the wound controlling the needle and subsequently the free end; the left hand introduces a second driver or hemostat from the left to assist with instrument ties. The needle is parked at times while the two drivers form consecutive throws to create a secure knot. Tissue handling in this segment is limited to suture tensioning; forceps are used mainly for control of the strand rather than tissue bites.

At 165–194 s work remains focused at the lower-to-mid segment of the same right-side slit. The left-hand gold-handled driver is used as the principal instrument for holding the needle; the right hand holds tissue forceps to evert the right wound edge during passages and to assist during knot tying. After a pass through tissue is completed, the needle is parked and the operators employ instrument ties—successive loops around the driver—to lock the stitch down. The suture ends remain adjacent to the wound margin while the throws are alternately cinched down. This segment emphasizes secure seating of the stitch at the lower portion before advancing closure.

From 195–224 s the operator places another sequential bite just superior to the previously secured stitch on the same incision. The left-hand driver approaches horizontally across the wound, the needle grasped about two‑thirds from the tip. The right forceps again stabilize the right edge for controlled exit and to present the tissue. After the needle exits the right side, the forceps briefly seize the tip to assist regrasping and reloading by the driver, demonstrating cooperative instrument exchange to maintain an efficient running progression. The suture loop sits over the incision as the needle is repositioned for the next bite.

In the 225–239 s window the left-hand needle driver approaches from the left crossing over the wound while the right-hand forceps grip and evert the right lip. The needle is grasped on the proximal third and advanced with wrist rotation, following the needle’s curvature in a controlled arc. Bites are consistently taken a few millimeters from the edge and at symmetric depths to approximate margins with a running motion. The suture is drawn through after each pass, slack removed, and instruments repositioned distally to continue the line. No separate knotting is performed in these frames—closure moves as a continuous series of bites.

Between 240–269 s the running closure clearly progresses superiorly along the same right-sided vertical line. The hands remain opposed: the right-hand driver crosses to deliver the bite while the left-hand tool provides counter-traction and controls the standing part. Bites are again shallow and placed in a subdermal or dermal plane to create eversion and consistent approximation. After each pass the strand is drawn cephalad to tighten the previously placed throws, and the needle is repositioned and regripped for the next bite. In these frames there is evidence of continuous advancement of the closure from the inferior toward the superior end.

The 270–299 s period continues that progression. Right and left hands trade roles as needed—right hand often driving the needle from the operator’s right side while the left hand steadies tissue and the suture strand. The curved needle is grasped at the proximal third and oriented perpendicular to the surface; the operator advances it through the right edge, then reloads to take the corresponding bite on the left edge. Bites are closely spaced and placed with consistent depth to maintain eversion along the running line. Slack is periodically swept to the side to keep the field clear while the stitch line is extended.

During 300–329 s the closure reaches a more superior segment of the same incision. Activity centers near the top of the wound where the next knot or throw is planned. Both hands converge: the right hand and forceps maintain edge apposition and eversion while an assisting instrument from the lower left helps form the knot. The needle is parked in some frames while instrument ties are made; in others it is regripped to take the next bite. The operators use a combination of loop formation and instrument throws to seat and secure individual passes when necessary, but the dominant method remains serial running bites tightened progressively.

From 330–359 s the line is again advanced, with work concentrated near the upper third of the rightmost slit. Left-hand drivers repeatedly regrasp the needle and the right hand alternates between manipulating the suture loop and grasping tissue. At times both hands use needle drivers to control and tension the loop during knot formation or to make instrument ties. Tissue handling is minimal when knots are being formed; otherwise forceps provide mild eversion to ensure dermal edge alignment. The suture loop is managed above the wound, then brought down and cinched to secure each segment as closure moves upward.

Frames in the 360–389 s range show attention to the mid-portion of the incision. The needle is at times parked in the most recent bite on the right edge; instruments cross the wound perpendicular to its axis when forming locks and throws. The left driver manipulates loops and controls the standing part while the right instrument engages loops and helps cinch them down. This segment illustrates the alternating rhythm of placing a bite, pulling the strand, parking the needle if needed, then securing the pass with instrument ties before continuing. Edge apposition along the lower and mid segments remains good with slight eversion from prior bites.

Between 390–404 s the lower two‑thirds of the right-of-center slit are largely approximated with a continuous running line of stitches; a small, short open segment persists near the upper third. The left-hand driver hovers over the superior, unapproximated segment preparing the next bite while the right hand intermittently manipulates the needle and uses fingers to press along closed segments to assess eversion and approximation. In these frames the operator adjusts orientation and tension but does not yet take a new penetration; instead they prepare and gather the standing part for the next pass. The wound edges along the closed portion maintain slight eversion, consistent with subdermal bites placed to promote edge inversion once healed.

The final single-frame snapshot at 405.0 s captures the field paused: the vertical incision slightly right of center shows partial closure. The inferior segment remains approximated with visible suture material and at least one tied stitch near the lower end; the superior portion remains open and ready for continuation. No instruments or hands are present in that moment, but the configuration of the suture—standing strand trailing inferiorly and the looped line of bites up to the mid-lower section—indicates the operator had advanced the running closure from the inferior tip cephalad and was prepared to resume placing the remaining bites toward the superior end.

Throughout the sequence the operators maintain consistent spatial relationships: left-sided needle drivers and right-sided forceps or drivers oppose each other across the wound, crossing above the incision as needed to deliver bites or to form instrument ties. The curved needle is repeatedly grasped at the proximal third to two‑thirds of its length, oriented near-perpendicular to the skin to follow its natural arc for controlled entry and exit. The right-hand instrument commonly provides tissue eversion to present the dermal margin and to secure a reproducible bite depth, while the left-hand needle driver controls needle trajectory and suture management. When tying, two drivers (or a driver and a hemostat) are used in alternation to form square instrument knots, with the free tail held under counter‑tension by forceps or by a second driver. The suture strand is habitually swept superiorly as bites are advanced, and parked needles are used to facilitate knot formation without losing position on the line.

Technique-wise, the procedure transitions from individual secured stitches at the extreme inferior end into a continuous running closure placed in a series of closely spaced, dermally oriented bites. Instrument ties are interspersed as needed to secure segments during the run. There is minor variation in bite depth across frames (some descriptions reference subcuticular/dermal plane passages, others mention full-thickness dermal bites), but the overall strategy remains consistent: sequentially place bites across both wound margins, draw the suture to approximate and evert the edges, then form instrument throws to lock segments where required. The team demonstrates an efficient alternation between placing new passes and securing existing ones to maintain tension and alignment of the wound.

Hand positions evolve predictably as closure advances: early frames show both hands concentrated at the inferior tip with tight crossing and knot formation; as the line progresses upward the hands move cephalad in tandem, maintaining opposing positions across the incision but widening the working field slightly to allow instrument exchanges and needle reloading. At times the right hand temporarily shifts from forceps to a needle driver to take a bite, illustrating role flexibility that helps maintain steady progress. Fingers are occasionally used to palpate and check eversion and tension along the closed segments.

In summary, the operator establishes closure at the inferior end of the right-sided vertical wound with initial passed stitches and instrument‑tied knots, then moves into a controlled running sequence of closely spaced bites advancing superiorly. Tissue is consistently presented with forceps for eversion, the curved needle is handled predictably in the driver’s mid‑to‑proximal segment, and instrument ties are employed intermittently to secure segments. By the end of the recorded sequence the lower two-thirds of the incision are approximated with a neat line of stitches exhibiting slight eversion; a short open segment near the upper third remains, with instruments poised and the standing suture managed in preparation for completing closure. Multiple neighboring slits on the pad remain untouched throughout; all activity, hand movements, and needle work are confined to and progress along the single right‑side vertical incision.
