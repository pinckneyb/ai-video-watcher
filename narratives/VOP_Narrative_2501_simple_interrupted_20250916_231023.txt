COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure takes place on a synthetic skin pad with three parallel vertical slits. From the outset, the closure work is concentrated on the vertical wound closest to the right edge of the pad. There are occasional glimpses of the other slits, but they are not developed into closure; the operative activity that proceeds and culminates in a finished suture line remains on the rightmost slit throughout.

The session opens with setup and the first pass on this rightmost incision near its lower third. The operator begins with a careful, perpendicular approach to tissue. The curved needle is loaded on the driver at about two‑thirds from the tip to preserve the working arc, with the wrist oriented to drive across the dermis in a smooth semicircle. The near (right) wound edge is gently presented using fine forceps, which lift and evert the margin just enough to expose a healthy bite of dermis without crushing the tissue. With the edge exposed, the needle driver advances the tip into the right margin and aims across the gap toward the left edge (0–14 s). This initial engagement is deliberate: the needle is perpendicular to the skin surface, the suture stands off the field to the left, and the hands oppose one another across the wound line.

Very early in the session there is a fleeting look at the central slit as the instruments hover and align (15–29 s). No bite is taken and nothing is tied there. The forceps briefly tent an edge and the driver is positioned; then the attention re‑centers on the rightmost incision where the rest of the work is performed. From this point forward, the action consistently returns to and progresses along the right-edge wound.

Back on the rightmost slit, the first stitch is passed. The driver hand works just superior and lateral to the wound, keeping the needle perpendicular, while the assisting hand manages the suture tail and steadies the pad (30–44 s). The needle traverses the right edge and then the left edge in a controlled arc. The strand is drawn through with the needle still controlled in the driver jaws—good practice to avoid needle drop. There is no knot yet at this moment; the loop is simply laid across the gap as the operator reorients for tying.

Soon after, a tied stitch appears in the mid-to-lower segment of the rightmost slit (45–59 s). The presence of a knot with short tails confirms completion of the first simple interrupted stitch. During these frames a new bite is being placed slightly superior to that knot. The operator continues to maintain a perpendicular approach, reloading the needle as needed to keep the working portion of the curve aligned. The near (right) edge is entered first, then the far edge, approximating the margins with smooth, even traction on the suture rather than aggressive forceps manipulation.

At the lower third of the same slit, a sequence shows the needle positioned to enter from the right edge toward the incision midline, followed by instrument ties and trimming of the tails (75–89 s). Edge eversion is modest—just enough to bring the dermal surfaces into approximation without inversion. The instrument tie sequence is consistent: alternating half-hitches laid squarely, with the driver passing over/under the standing part as the left hand, when present, tensions the opposite limb. Scissors then enter to cut the tails to an appropriate length. At this stage, a single completed stitch is clearly visible with trimmed tails at the lower end of the incision.

The next several passages and setups consolidate control of the suture line and prepare for additional stitches immediately above the first. The operator frequently reloads the needle two‑thirds from the tip and keeps the needle arc orthogonal to the skin. Forceps are intermittently used to stabilize and slightly evert the edge to guide symmetric bites. At this point, one completed stitch is seen while the needle is aligned for the next (90–119 s and 120–134 s). The trajectory is consistent: from the right wound edge across to the left, mirroring the initial stitch, always aligning the arc to preserve bite geometry and spacing.

Progress then becomes visible: two completed simple interrupted stitches appear on the rightmost slit, clustered in the upper half of the segment being worked (135–149 s). Activity in these frames is dominated by knot tying and tail trimming rather than needle passes, confirming that a second stitch has been placed and secured. The right hand uses the needle driver for tying and then introduces scissors to trim; the left hand occasionally enters with forceps to stabilize the knot or the edge while the throws are set. Immediately thereafter, tying is completed and both stitches appear secure with appropriately cut tails (150–164 s). The wound edges adjacent to these knots are approximated with mild eversion; no excessive tension is noted.

With two sutures in place, the operator initiates the third stitch just inferior to the prior knots. The driver approaches perpendicular to the edge, the forceps gently evert the near margin, and the needle tip is poised for entry (165–179 s). A new stitch is then actively passed above the two existing stitches: the right hand drives the needle from right to left while the left hand with forceps lifts the opposite edge to accept the bite (180–194 s). There is controlled traction on the suture tail to maintain exposure and alignment of prior throws.

In the next sequence, the same slit is described from a slightly different angle as an “oblique laceration” with two stitches clustered mid‑to‑superiorly (195–209 s). Despite the descriptor, the work remains on the same right‑side wound. The needle is reloaded at the proximal third, perpendicular to the skin, and prepared to pass another bite adjacent to the existing stitches. The left hand manages the strand and visibility; the right hand remains the driver. No new knot is tied in these frames, so the count remains two.

The momentum builds through setup and knot maneuvers (210–224 s). The driver is used to organize the thread and prepare for tying. Direct tissue grasp with forceps is minimal here; the wound edges are approximated mainly by suture tension during the throws. This culminates in a definitive tie and trim sequence for the next stitch (225–239 s): the left hand holds the needle holder and advances the needle; the right hand uses forceps to stabilize the right wound edge during passage, and scissors arrive from the left to cut tails once the knot is secured. By the end of this sequence, three completed simple stitches are visible along the mid‑to‑lower portion of the rightmost slit. The spacing is short and regular; eversion is slight but adequate.

After establishing the third stitch, the operator tightens and trims as needed without placing a new bite (240–254 s), while maintaining pad stability with the left hand. Then a new bite is initiated proximal to the existing stitches with the left hand holding the driver and the right hand using forceps to evert the near edge (255–269 s). The needle is again grasped at about one‑third from the swage or two‑thirds from the tip, with the curve oriented perpendicular to the skin, and advanced in a right‑to‑left arc across the wound. Edge control is delicate and precise—no crushing, just enough purchase to present the dermis.

The fourth stitch is then fully placed and tied (270–284 s). The right hand holds the driver and executes instrument ties while the left hand alternates between holding forceps for tissue control and managing the free suture end for counter‑tension. Multiple throws are laid squarely; the knot is dressed down, and the stitch is secured. Cutting isn’t clearly shown in this particular segment, but the throw sequence is completed. With this knot, the count rises to four completed stitches on the rightmost incision.

At one point, a segment characterizes the ongoing closure as a “running sequence” descending from the superior end (285–299 s). This appears to be a momentary misinterpretation of the field, likely reflecting the way the free strand is managed between interrupted placements rather than a true conversion to a continuous suture. No running lock is formed, no continuous loop tension is seen across multiple bites, and all other intervals before and after show classic interrupted technique with discrete knots and trimmed tails. The operator continues to reload the needle perpendicular to the wound and to tie individual knots after each pass, consistent with the selected technique.

This is reinforced in the subsequent frames: the driver is used primarily to tie a new stitch while the left hand tensions the opposite limb (300–314 s). By the end of this interval, three completed stitches are visible with a fourth in progress, and immediately afterward four tied stitches can be seen clustered along the mid‑to‑lower half of the slit (315–329 s). The operator focuses on tightening and trimming in place without new needle passages, using scissors introduced by the dominant hand to cut tails to length, leaving four compact, evenly spaced knots (315–329 s).

Attention then turns to extending the row superiorly. With four completed stitches in place, the operator sets up for the next pass at the superior aspect of the same incision. The left hand holds the needle driver with the loaded needle oriented perpendicular to the left/far edge, while the right hand holds forceps at the right/near margin to present tissue for an orthogonal approach (330–344 s). The instruments oppose each other across the wound, creating a controlled target for the next bite. In the next sequence the right hand again holds the driver, the left hand assists with forceps or fingertip eversion, and another pass is taken toward the superior end; the suture is drawn through in preparation for tying (345–359 s). Throughout these steps the operator keeps the long strand to the left of the field to maintain organization and avoid tangles, reloading the needle between passes to sustain the perpendicular entry and exit angles.

One segment briefly suggests that five completed stitches are visible (360–374 s). However, the immediately subsequent sequences clarify the actual status: the operator pulls a previously placed pass through, introduces scissors, and trims a tail without adding a new completed stitch (375–389 s), and the final still frames show four completed stitches at rest (390–398 s). The inconsistency likely arises from transient overlap of a loose loop over an existing knot or camera angle that made a loop appear as an extra stitch. Importantly, the final static view confirms the true total.

Across the middle and late phases, several details of technique remain consistent and well executed:
- Needle handling is meticulous. The needle is held about two‑thirds from the tip (or at the proximal third in some frames) in the driver, always oriented to present a perpendicular bite. The operator repeatedly reloads the needle to restore the perfect arc alignment before each pass.
- Edge control is gentle. The assisting hand uses Adson forceps sparingly to evert and stabilize the dermal margin, especially the near edge at the right side of the slit. In some sequences, fingers rather than forceps provide counter‑tension to avoid unnecessary trauma to the silicone tissue.
- Instrument tying is the standard method. After each passage, the right hand most often performs instrument ties with the needle driver while the left hand tensions the opposing limb. Knots are seated neatly, and tails are trimmed to a short, consistent length with scissors that approach from the right or left depending on the hand holding the driver.
- Spatial organization is disciplined. The driver typically works just lateral and slightly superior to the current bite site; the assisting hand is medial/inferior, crossing the field only as needed to grasp tissue or manage the standing part. The suture strand is kept off the operative line to preserve visibility. The pad is occasionally stabilized with one hand while the other ties or cuts.
- Edge eversion is modest but present. Each pair of bites produces a slight lift of the wound edges before the knot is seated, resulting in a good dermal apposition without inversion.

There are also minor irregularities worth noting. Early on, there is a brief camera cut to the central slit where instruments appear to align for a pass (15–29 s), but no stitch is taken there and the operator promptly resumes work on the rightmost incision. Later, one segment describes the ongoing closure as a running sequence (285–299 s). Given that the remainder of the procedure shows discrete knots and trimming after each pass—and no continuous running tension across multiple bites—this likely reflects a moment when loops from adjacent interrupted stitches overlapped or when the managing hand temporarily laid the free strand along the wound in a way that mimicked a running line. Another segment (360–374 s) records five completed stitches, but the two subsequent sequences immediately contradict this, showing only four tied stitches in place; the final still frames verify that the line ends with four.

Hand roles evolve naturally as the operator alternates tasks. Early frames show the left hand occasionally driving the needle with the right hand assisting, which then transitions to the more common configuration of the right hand as the driver and the left hand assisting with forceps or suture management. This ambidextrous switch occurs without disrupting the flow, and the spatial choreography remains consistent: the driver stays just lateral to the wound, approaches perpendicular, and crosses the line during knot throws; the assisting hand lifts the near edge when needed and otherwise manages the free end, shifting position only to give the driver a clear path. Scissors are introduced from whichever side offers the safest, most direct angle to cut tails without jeopardizing knot security.

Suture count progression across the procedure is clear when viewed through the completed, tied knots:
- Start: 0 stitches tied at the rightmost slit as the first pass is initiated and then completed.
- After the first tying and trimming sequence at the lower third: 1 completed stitch.
- Following the next cycles of passing and tying: 2 completed stitches are visible and confirmed in multiple segments (135–149 s; 150–164 s; 165–179 s through 210–224 s show preparations without adding a new completed stitch).
- After the tie-and-trim sequence centered over the mid‑to‑lower slit: 3 completed stitches (by the end of 225–239 s, with corroborating maintenance frames at 240–254 s and 255–269 s).
- After the subsequent pass and tying at the superior side of the existing row: 4 completed stitches (270–284 s). This count holds steady in the later segments despite one temporary miscount; it is reconfirmed during tightening and trimming (300–314 s; 315–329 s; 330–344 s; 345–359 s; 375–389 s).

Final state and mandatory count verification:
- In the final still sequence (390–398 s), the wound lies near the right border of the pad, approximated by a short, closely spaced row of stitches. Four completed simple interrupted stitches are visible along the rightmost slit. A free suture end with needle hangs inferior to the lowest stitch, oriented downward along the incision line. No new bites are taken in these final frames, and the two central slits remain untouched.
- Therefore, the procedure results in 4 completed sutures along the rightmost vertical incision.
- Count progression summary: 0 at initiation → 1 after the first tie → 2 after the next tie-and-trim cycle → 3 after the mid‑portion tie-and-trim (by 225–239 s) → 4 after the subsequent superior stitch is tied (by 270–284 s) → remains 4 through the end (final verification at 390–398 s).

Technique consistency throughout is in line with a simple interrupted closure as selected in the app. Bites are perpendicular, spacing is short and regular, instrument ties are used after each pass, and tails are trimmed. Minor inconsistencies in the descriptions—one brief setup over the central slit, one segment describing a running sequence, and one momentary overcount of completed stitches—do not change the core picture: a single suture line on the rightmost incision is incrementally closed with simple interrupted stitches, culminating in a stable, four‑stitch closure with neatly cut tails and adequately approximated wound edges.
