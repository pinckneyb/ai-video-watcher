============================================================
Work throughout the recording remained focused on the same left‑most vertical incision in the upper‑left quadrant of the practice pad. The wound was a straight, full‑thickness linear defect on synthetic skin, roughly 1.5–4 cm in length depending on the moment captured; multiple previously placed sutures were present along its length from early in the sequence and new stitches were added sequentially toward the superior/medial end as the procedure progressed. The operator wore green gloves and used a two‑instrument, bimanual technique: a needle‑holding instrument (needle driver/holder) paired with toothed tissue forceps (Adson‑style pickup) or fine forceps for tissue handling and suture management. Throughout the case the two instruments remained closely coordinated, their tips typically within 1–4 cm of one another, converging directly over the wound and moving together as the stitch sequence advanced.

Initial passes and setup
In the first frames the operator approached the incision from above and slightly lateral, positioning the needle driver nearly perpendicular to the skin to take controlled, short bites. The non‑dominant hand stabilized and elevated the nearest wound edge with the toothed forceps, providing countertraction and slight eversion to present the dermal margin for purchase. Needle grips varied between mid‑shaft and closer to the swage across frames; early grips tended to be mid‑shaft, affording controlled rotation of the curved needle through the dermal substitute. Bites were placed just adjacent to the wound margin to capture epidermal/dermal layers without engaging deep tissues, consistent with skin‑only closure on the simulator.

Sequential interrupted placement and technique development
From the outset the operator favored sequential interrupted stitches placed along the length of the incision. Each pass followed a similar rhythm: the forceps lifted and everted the near edge, the needle driver approached from a lateral or superior angle, the curved needle was rotated in a short controlled arc through the dermis of the opposite edge, and the suture limb was drawn through and tensioned to approximate the edges. Instrument orientation varied slightly with each stitch — sometimes the needle holder advanced from the operator’s right or cranial right, other times from above/left — but the core sequence of opposing instrument stabilization and needle rotation remained constant.

As the sequence progressed, the operator adjusted needle grasp and arc to suit the local geometry of the wound. In many passes the needle was grasped nearer the mid‑to‑proximal shaft, allowing a stable, controlled rotation through tissue. In other frames the grasp moved slightly distal toward the curve or closer to the swage when a shorter control arc was needed to exit a shallow margin. These shifts in grasp were paired with corresponding changes in approach angle: near‑perpendicular entries for direct bites and slightly oblique trajectories when working toward the superior end of the incision. Throughout, the operator favored short, precise rotations rather than wide sweeping movements, indicating an intent to take consistent, superficial‑to‑mid‑dermal bites.

Tissue handling and approximation
The tissue forceps were used predictably to evert and align the edges just before each pass. The operator elevated the edge to present the dermal plane, creating small peaks of tension that allowed the needle to enter and exit cleanly. The approximation achieved after tightening each limb was generally good: margins came together with close apposition and mild outward eversion in places — a common and acceptable outcome for skin closure. There were occasional minor inconsistencies in bite depth and spacing; some frames show slightly shallower or deeper purchases and modest variability in the distance from the wound edge, but overall the operator maintained alignment and reasonable symmetry as stitches accumulated along the incision.

Spatial coordination and hand evolution
Hand positions evolved in a consistent, task‑driven manner. Early passes showed the dominant hand (most often the right) using the needle driver to approach from superior or lateral positions while the non‑dominant hand stabilized the tissue inferiorly or medially. As the operator advanced proximally toward the superior end of the incision, instrument crossings and small rotations of the wrists became more frequent: the forceps and needle driver occasionally crossed midline above the wound to allow better access to the next bite site. Despite these crossings, the two instruments remained closely apposed and coordinated — usually within two to four centimeters — enabling precise needle control and immediate tissue stabilization.

At times a second fine instrument approached (e.g., a straight forceps or a scissor instrument) to receive the needle or to prepare for knot tying and trimming; toward the end of the sequence the needle driver sometimes withdrew the needle upward as the non‑dominant hand prepared to secure knots and trim tails. Throughout the case the operator used small, controlled wrist motions rather than sweeping arm movements, maintaining a compact working field centered over the incision.

Knot tying, tensioning and finishing maneuvers
After passing each limb, the operator tensioned sutures to oppose edges and formed knots on the superficial surface. Multiple frames show the process of drawing suture through, positioning the tail, and preparing to form throws. Later in the case, particularly near the superior segment, the operator moved into knot‑securing and trimming maneuvers: the needle driver and fine forceps worked in parallel over the wound while the needle driver withdrew and oriented the suture for knot formation; scissors or another fine instrument were brought in to trim excess tails once the knot was secure. These frames indicate progression from placement to finalization for each interrupted stitch.

A noted deviation in suture pattern
While the predominant and consistent pattern throughout was sequential interrupted closure, a short segment of frames captured a continuous running technique being advanced laterally toward an existing medial knot. In that sequence the needle was guided progressively across the incision with suture thread being fed and drawn through to form a linear running stitch, and by the end of those frames the suture tail was extended as a loop was pulled through. This brief continuous pass contrasts with the otherwise sequential interrupted technique evident elsewhere. The rest of the recording, however, shows repeated interrupted passes, tightening, knot tying and trimming — suggesting that the operator either experimented with or briefly employed a running limb in addition to interrupted apparatus, or that a short running reinforcement was placed near an area of existing interrupted knots. Despite this inconsistency, the operator continued to use the same approach to tissue handling, needle rotation and tensioning.

Needle handling subtleties and control
Needle grasp position alternated between mid‑shaft and closer to the swage depending on the local need for arc control and available working space. Mid‑shaft grips allowed controlled rotations and predictable arcs, whereas more distal or proximal grasps were used when the operator needed to bring the tip out at a precise shallow angle near the wound margin. The needle’s orientation was often from lateral‑to‑medial across the incision but occasionally approached perpendicular or oblique to the plane of the skin; these orientation shifts were coordinated with tissue stabilization by the opposing forceps to ensure the bite captured the dermal equivalent and produced edge apposition without excessive puckering.

Consistency and refinement over time
Technique consistency was generally good: the operator maintained a methodical cadence of lift, pass, draw, tighten, and secure. Small refinements occurred as the case progressed — for example, the operator increasingly favored slightly more eversion when approximating edges near previously placed knots, and adjusted needle grasp to accommodate tighter local geometry as the superior margin became more crowded with sutures. The spacing between bites remained roughly uniform along most of the incision, and the operator repeatedly used the same combination of controlled needle rotation and opposing forceps traction to ensure secure purchase of dermis.

Final appearance and completion
By the end of the recording the superior portion of the incision had been closed with a series of sequentially placed and secured sutures. The wound edges were approximated closely across their length with mild eversion at several stitch sites — a typical outcome that helps epidermal edge apposition during healing. Knots had been tightened and, in later frames, the operator completed finishing steps including withdrawing the needle, orienting suture tails and trimming excess suture material with scissors or a fine instrument. The sutures lay in a continuous line of interrupted knots along the length of the incision; where a brief running element was observed it ended adjacent to a medial knot and the remainder of the closure proceeded with interrupted technique.

Overall impression
The case demonstrates disciplined, bimanual technique with deliberate needle control and consistent tissue handling focused on skin‑only closure. The operator effectively coordinated a needle driver and tissue forceps to take superficial to mid‑dermal bites, maintain edge alignment, and produce secure apposition. There were minor variations in bite depth and occasional changes in needle grasp and approach angle as anatomy and previously placed sutures demanded, and a short observed continuous pass introduced some variability in the otherwise interrupted sequence. These differences did not compromise the overall closure: the incision was progressively approximated along its length, knots were secured, excess suture was trimmed and the final repair achieved tidy, closely opposed margins with expected mild eversion in places, consistent with appropriate skin closure technique on a synthetic model.
