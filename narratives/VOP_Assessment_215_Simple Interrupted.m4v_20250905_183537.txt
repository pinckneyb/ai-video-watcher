Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Summative assessment:
Your motion and flow are deliberate and largely disciplined: you plan the bite, evert, drive a clean, perpendicular arc, follow the needle out with immediate strand control, then tie and move on. Triangulation is stable, the driver stays vertical at key moments, and the suture is consistently swept lateral to keep the field open. Hand coordination is solid; the intermittent dominance switch does not degrade accuracy, and needle reloads reliably restore the correct grasp at the proximal third with point protection.
