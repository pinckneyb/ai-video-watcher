COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The case proceeds on a single central linear incision in the silicone practice pad, and the entire sequence is a methodical closure of that same midline defect. From the first frames through the last, the operator repeatedly returns to the central vertical wound and advances a series of interrupted skin sutures while intermittently finishing, tensioning, and trimming previously placed stitches. Throughout the recording the team uses standard two‑instrument technique: a needle driver to control and rotate a curved needle and fine tissue forceps (Adson/precision pickups) to present, evert, and stabilize the skin edges and to manage suture tails during tying.

Opening segment (0–90 s)
At the outset the midline incision—approximately a few centimeters long—is clearly visible with several already-placed interrupted stitches bordering the portion being worked. The earliest frames show the needle driver approaching from one side while the forceps approach from the other, the instruments crossing just above the wound. The needle (a curved surgical needle affixed to suture) is grasped in the driver roughly along the shaft or mid-portion rather than at the swage or tip; this grip is maintained in nearly all passes to allow precise rotation through the synthetic dermis. The driver’s axis is typically perpendicular-to-oblique to the wound plane and is rotated in short controlled arcs for passage. The forceps consistently lift and evert the near edge so that bites are taken close to the epidermal margin with even, superficial dermal depth appropriate for interrupted skin closure on the pad.

Early passes show the operator taking symmetric bites from opposing edges—forceps present the near edge while the driver advances the needle through the far edge—with short working distances (a few centimeters) and instruments converging over the same stitch point. As stitches are placed, the assistant hand gathers suture tails and occasionally exchanges instruments. In these initial minutes the pattern of placing interrupted stitches is established: take a bite, pull the suture through, retrieve the free end with forceps, and prepare for knot tying.

Progression and rhythmic placement (90–240 s)
Through the mid-portion of the recording the operator maintains a steady rhythm of sequential interrupted sutures placed centrally along the incision. Hand positions evolve subtly but predictably: one instrument (either the needle driver or the forceps, depending on the frame) approaches from above or from the operator’s left, while the opposing pickup comes from the lateral/right or inferior side. The instruments repeatedly cross above the wound so the needle driver can rotate the curved needle through the tissue while the forceps provide counter-traction and align the edge for a consistent bite.

Needle handling remains constant: the curved needle is gripped mid-shaft to distal-third, the driver rotates it through a short arc with the tip directed into the wound margin, and regrips occur as needed to complete the pass. Bites are shallow-to-moderate in depth, confined to the dermal layer of the simulator, and consistently placed at regular spacing between prior stitches; this produces a line of approximated skin with slight eversion at each suture site. Between needle passes, the non-driving hand frequently manipulates suture tails—pulling slack laterally, maintaining tension, and positioning loops for knot tying.

Technique refinement and tying maneuvers (240–360 s)
Midway through the procedure, emphasis shifts intermittently from raw needle passage to finishing steps: seating and tightening knots, trimming suture tails, and adjusting bite symmetry. Several sequences show the needle removed from the field and both hands focused on knot security—one hand holds the suture loop or an existing knot while the other performs instrument throws or clips tails. The driver is used not only to pass the needle but also to assist in knot tying, grasping suture limbs and controlling tension while the forceps manipulate tissue.

Instrument positions continue to remain tightly coordinated: tips usually sit within 1–4 cm of one another above the incision to permit stable needle transfer, precise bite placement, and secure knot formation. At times the left hand plays the dominant role as needle driver, at other times the right; minor inconsistencies in handedness are present in the frame descriptions, but the procedural flow—driver advancing the needle, forceps stabilizing tissue and suture material—remains consistent.

Late passes and stitch consolidation (360–450 s)
Later frames show renewed needle activity as the operator fills remaining gaps between previously placed interrupted stitches. The same basic mechanics recur: forceps tent and evert the near edge, the driver approaches from above/left or above/right and rotates the curved needle through the opposing edge, then the suture is pulled through and prepared for knotting. Pairs of instruments often parallel each other across the wound, the forceps holding the near margin and the driver delivering the bite from a slightly oblique angle to achieve perpendicular entry relative to the edge.

Throughout this phase, attention is paid to consistent spacing and similar bite depth so that the line of closure looks uniform. The operator occasionally re-grasps the needle to adjust trajectory and withdraws the tip in short arcs to avoid over-penetration of the simulated tissue. The assistant hand remains busy organizing suture tails to prevent entanglement as more stitches are added. When the needle is absent from the scene, the team concentrates on knot-securing maneuvers, ensuring each interrupted stitch lies snugly without strangulation of the tissue surrogate.

Finishing maneuvers and finalization (450 s–end)
In the final portion of the recording, sequences increasingly show knot manipulation and suture tail management rather than fresh needle passes. Instruments converge on the central stitch cluster to cinch previously placed sutures down and trim tails; the forceps hold short segments of suture near the knot while the driver or scissors-like instrument cuts excess thread. The last frames reveal no free needle—the forceps are holding suture tails and the left-hand instrument’s tip is oriented toward the knot area as if to trim or inspect the final throws. This indicates the closure has been completed and the operator is performing final knot security checks and tail trimming.

Spatial and ergonomic summary
From start to finish the operative field is compact and centered. Hands habitually flank the incision at roughly 10–2 o’clock positions (depending on frame), and instrument tips meet over the midline to control needle trajectory and suture handling. Working distances are short—commonly within a few centimeters—to permit delicate control of the curved needle and precise approximation of the synthetic epidermal edges. The team uses crossing motions and minor instrument exchanges, but maintains a consistent two-instrument approach where one instrument drives the needle and the other stabilizes tissue and suture limbs.

Consistency and technique maturation
The overall technique stays consistent: interrupted, percutaneous dermal/epidermal bites taken with a curved needle held mid-shaft and rotated through opposing edges; forceps used to evert and present tissue; knots tied and tightened sequentially. Over time the operator refines spacing uniformity, bite depth, and knot security. Early passes establish the pattern; mid-procedure passes maintain rhythm and spacing; late steps emphasize knot seating and trimming for a tidy, eversion-preserving finished line.

Final appearance
By the close of the recording the incision is fully approximated along its length with a continuous line of evenly spaced interrupted stitches. Edges sit in close opposition with slight eversion at each stitch, consistent with appropriate dermal apposition for skin closure. Knot throws have been completed and suture tails managed—final frames show knot manipulation and trimming with no free needle present—indicating procedural completion. Overall, the closure reflects controlled, repetitive technique with careful tissue handling, steady needle control, and progressive finishing until the line is secure and neatly approximated.

Notes on minor discrepancies
Frame descriptions occasionally reference a lateral or transverse incision on the pad; however, the dominant and continuous focus through the vast majority of frames is the central midline linear incision described above. Some minor inconsistencies between frames exist in reported laterality of the dominant hand or brief instrument exchanges; these appear to reflect brief positional adjustments or differences in camera perspective rather than a change in operative target or overall method. The procedure otherwise demonstrates a coherent, stepwise placement of interrupted skin sutures with consistent instrument technique and final secure approximation of the wound.
