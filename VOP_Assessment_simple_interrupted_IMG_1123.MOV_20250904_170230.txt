Pattern: Simple Interrupted

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
--------------------
Score: 3.6/5.0 - proficient

Perpendicular needle passes:
The needle was consistently loaded and presented near 90 degrees, and passes followed the curvature with controlled regrasping and centrally seated knots suggesting symmetric bites. Occasional freehand staging and mid-to-distal clamping could allow small angle drift or shear, keeping this at competent rather than exceptional.

Gentle tissue handling:
Adsons were used to evert with single, precise grasps, instruments stayed mostly off the tissue, and extraction/pull-through were smooth without crushing. This reflects gentle, deliberate handling that preserves edge integrity.

Square, secure knots:
Instrument ties were alternating, tensioned in opposition, and laid flat and centrally with direction changes to square each throw; tails were trimmed appropriately short. The knots appear reliable and well controlled throughout.

Appropriate approximation/tension:
Edges were brought together without blanching or gapping, with progressive tightening and knots centered over the incision. The closure maintained even approximation without puckering as sutures accumulated.

Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm):
The final line shows uniformly spaced stitches that read as consistent across the wound. While not explicitly gauged, the pattern meets standard for regularity.

Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable):
Forceps-assisted eversion produced flat-to-slightly everted edges that remained stable after tying. No inversion or edge rolling is evident.

Economy of time and motion:
Work stayed within a stable triangle and movements were purposeful, but frequent off-field resets, hovering, freehand needle reloading, and needle parking introduced extra steps. Reducing departures and keeping the needle in the holder between passes would streamline the sequence.

Summative assessment:

Summative assessment:
Tighten the workflow by keeping the needle in the holder and parked in a defined safe zone rather than in the pad, and avoid freehand needle handling to preserve consistent right-angle entry/exit. Standardize bite geometry using a measurable rule of thumb (for example, 5 mm from the edge and 5–7 mm spacing) and verify symmetry before tying; commit to a single efficient regrasp near the junction of the proximal/mid third to follow the arc without sliding to the tip. Maintain one precise toothed grasp per edge for eversion, let the needle move the tissue rather than the forceps, and pre-plan the next bite during pull-through to eliminate hovering. When tying, keep throws low and centered with equal, opposing vectors, continue posting to prevent lateral knot migration, and leave appropriate tail length (3–5 mm for monofilament, 2–3 mm for braided) to balance neatness with security. These refinements will reduce wasted motion, improve repeatability, and further harden the reliability of your simple interrupted closures.
