Here’s the adjusted AI output template for subcuticular sutures. It strips out the false “not intradermal” critiques and forces the system to assume dermal confinement is correct. All feedback is redirected toward cadence, symmetry, handling, knot quality, closure, and efficiency.

✅ Revised AI Output Template for Subcuticular Sutures

Instruction to AI:
If the case is labeled subcuticular, do not state or imply that passes left the dermis or that intradermal progression was absent. Assume the running intradermal track is correct. Generate critique only on the seven rubric domains below.

Rubric-Based Output

Consistent dermal bites (running path)

Comment on step length, bite depth, and cadence.

Ignore whether the track appears intradermal vs. epidermal.

Opposing entry/exit symmetry

Assess balance between left and right edges.

No unintended surface breaches

Only flag deliberate externalization (e.g., external finishing knot mid-run).

Do not describe dermal passes as surface breaches.

Gentle tissue handling

Assess instrument control, forceps use, needle rotation, and tension.

Square, secure knots

Evaluate throw orientation, tension, and end technique (buried knot or acceptable subcuticular finish).

Flat, well-approximated skin

Comment on skin contour, edge approximation, avoidance of ridging or gapping.

Economy of time and motion

Note workflow smoothness, triangulation, reloading, and efficiency.

📋 Summative Comment (Template)

For a subcuticular closure, the assumed intradermal pathway was maintained. The essential requirement of a continuous dermal progression is satisfied. Performance is judged on bite regularity, symmetry, tissue handling, knot security, skin apposition, and overall efficiency.

Highlight strengths (e.g., “smooth cadence and consistent step length,” “atraumatic handling,” “secure end-loop finish”).

Note deficits (e.g., “occasional asymmetry,” “slight ridging,” “pauses that interrupted flow”).

Avoid any reference to “failure to remain intradermal” or “surface breaches” unless there was a clear externalization outside the start/finish.
