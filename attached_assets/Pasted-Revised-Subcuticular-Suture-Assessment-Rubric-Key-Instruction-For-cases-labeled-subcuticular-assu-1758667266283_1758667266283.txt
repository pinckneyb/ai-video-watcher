Revised Subcuticular Suture Assessment Rubric

Key Instruction:
For cases labeled subcuticular, assume the working line is correctly confined to the dermis even if visual cues suggest surface entry or exit. Do not penalize for apparent epidermal perforations caused by pad coloration. Assess all other criteria normally.

1. Consistent dermal bites (running path)

Definition: Regular, even spacing and depth of bites, advancing smoothly in a continuous path.

Scoring:

5 â€“ Excellent: Uniform depth and step length, continuous smooth progression.

3 â€“ Competent: Mostly even, occasional minor variation in depth/spacing.

1 â€“ Developing: Irregular progression, frequent corrections, or inconsistent bite pattern.

Note: Assume intradermal confinement is correct; judge only on cadence, spacing, and flow.

2. Opposing entry/exit symmetry

Definition: Left and right bites mirror one another in depth and distance from wound edge.

Scoring:

5 â€“ Excellent: Symmetry consistently achieved.

3 â€“ Competent: Minor but noticeable asymmetries.

1 â€“ Developing: Frequent misalignment or lopsided bites.

3. No unintended surface breaches

Instruction: Ignore false surface perforations due to pad color. Only downgrade if there are clear, deliberate external exits (e.g., external loop tied mid-run).

Scoring:

5 â€“ Excellent: No externalization beyond starting/finishing anchors.

3 â€“ Competent: Occasional externalized loop or knot.

1 â€“ Developing: Multiple externalized passes or knots along incision.

4. Gentle tissue handling

Definition: Handling minimizes trauma. Controlled needle driving, correct tension, and atraumatic forceps use.

Scoring: 1â€“5 scale as before.

5. Square, secure knots

Definition: Knots correctly oriented, tensioned, and buried (or finished by approved subcuticular end-loop).

Scoring:

5 â€“ Excellent: Secure, squared, properly hidden.

3 â€“ Competent: Mostly square, some tail excess or knot prominence.

1 â€“ Developing: Frequent loosening, slippage, or incorrect throws.

6. Flat, well-approximated skin

Definition: Final closure shows smooth skin apposition without ridging, gapping, or step-off.

Scoring:

5 â€“ Excellent: Flat, aesthetically pleasing approximation.

3 â€“ Competent: Generally flat with minor ridging/prominence.

1 â€“ Developing: Noticeable gapping, overlapping, or irregular contour.

7. Economy of time and motion

Definition: Efficient, organized technique with minimal wasted movement.

Scoring:

5 â€“ Excellent: Smooth, continuous workflow, no fumbling.

3 â€“ Competent: Steady but interrupted by minor inefficiencies.

1 â€“ Developing: Frequent pauses, reloading problems, or disorganized sequence.

ðŸ“‹ Summative Comment (Revised)

When procedure is labeled subcuticular, assume the dermal track is correct. The essential criterion of intradermal progression is satisfied. Summative comments should focus on:

Bite consistency and symmetry.

Tissue handling quality.

Knot construction and security.

Skin approximation quality.

Efficiency of motion.

If errors are noted, they should relate to technique execution (cadence, symmetry, handling, closure quality) rather than to false surface breaches.
