Subcuticular Suture Rubric (Neutralized Scale Language)
1. Consistent dermal bites (running path)

5 – Excellent: Bites uniform in depth and spacing; progression smooth and uninterrupted.

4 – Proficient: Mostly even bites with only minor variation.

3 – Competent: Noticeable variability in spacing or depth, but overall progression maintained.

2 – Developing: Frequent irregularity in bite pattern requiring corrections.

1 – Poor: Inconsistent and erratic progression; path lacks continuity.

2. Opposing entry/exit symmetry

5 – Excellent: Consistent mirror symmetry of bites across both wound edges.

4 – Proficient: Generally symmetric, with only slight asymmetry in a few passes.

3 – Competent: Symmetry inconsistent, but closure still serviceable.

2 – Developing: Frequent lopsided or uneven entry/exit points.

1 – Poor: Symmetry absent; bites misaligned throughout.

3. No unintended surface breaches

(Neutralized: no mention of “intracuticular failure”)

5 – Excellent: No externalization beyond start or finish anchors.

4 – Proficient: One minor loop or tail visible externally.

3 – Competent: Occasional externalization noted, but limited impact on closure.

2 – Developing: Multiple externalized loops or knots detracting from result.

1 – Poor: Frequent externalization; finish not confined to intended plane.

4. Gentle tissue handling

5 – Excellent: Consistently atraumatic handling with precise control.

4 – Proficient: Mostly atraumatic with occasional minor excess tension or force.

3 – Competent: Generally careful, but noticeable moments of rough handling.

2 – Developing: Frequent heavy force or poor control, risking tissue trauma.

1 – Poor: Rough, careless handling causing significant tissue stress.

5. Square, secure knots

5 – Excellent: All knots secure, squared, properly oriented, and well hidden.

4 – Proficient: Knots secure and mostly square; occasional excess tail length.

3 – Competent: Some knots slightly uneven or prominent but still hold.

2 – Developing: Multiple knots poorly formed or loosely tensioned.

1 – Poor: Knots insecure, slipping, or improperly constructed.

6. Flat, well-approximated skin

5 – Excellent: Closure flat, edges precisely apposed, minimal contour change.

4 – Proficient: Nearly flat, with very slight ridging or contour variation.

3 – Competent: General approximation achieved, but ridges or small gaps evident.

2 – Developing: Frequent misalignment or edge irregularity.

1 – Poor: Edges gapping, overlapping, or markedly uneven.

7. Economy of time and motion

5 – Excellent: Workflow smooth, efficient, with no wasted motion.

4 – Proficient: Generally efficient, with minor pauses or corrections.

3 – Competent: Steady pace but with noticeable inefficiencies.

2 – Developing: Frequent reloading problems, pauses, or disorganized sequence.

1 – Poor: Chaotic, inefficient, frequent errors disrupting progress.
