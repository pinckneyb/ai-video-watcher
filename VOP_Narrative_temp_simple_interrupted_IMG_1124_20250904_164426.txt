COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
From the opening seconds, the video establishes a clear right-hand–dominant workflow on a multi‑incision synthetic pad, with the left hand assisting for exposure and suture control. The right hand enters with a needle driver and immediately loads the curved needle at the mid-to-proximal third, keeping the jaws perpendicular to the arc and the needle perpendicular to the pad. The left hand brings in Adson forceps to gently lift and evert the near wound edge, presenting a clean entry site. The first bite is driven in a smooth arc, with the driver regripping closer to the needle tip mid‑pass to follow the curvature precisely and complete the exit. As the suture is drawn through, the right hand leaves a short tail on the near side while the left manages the long limb away from the field to avoid entanglement.

Without breaking rhythm, the operator transitions to tying. With the needle parked or still controlled in the driver, the right hand uses the instrument for an instrument tie: the long limb is wrapped around the jaws, the driver crosses to capture the short tail, and the throw is pulled through and slid down. The left hand alternates between holding the short free end and the standing end to square the knot and seat it centrally. Early on, the left relies on fingertips rather than forceps to maintain approximation as the knot advances; the driver at times is held vertically as a post to guide the knot straight down to the wound. Throws are tightened with opposing traction and alternating direction so the knot lies flat over the incision. The driver is briefly set down and regripped as needed to keep the jaws aligned and the loops controlled. By the end of this first tying sequence, the knot is compact and centered, with short tails.

The focus then shifts to the small central vertical incision. The left hand resumes with Adson forceps on the left edge to evert and stabilize, while the right hand approaches from the upper/right, holding the needle correctly at its proximal third and aiming for a perpendicular right‑to‑left pass. The needle tip is positioned a few millimeters from the right margin and begins to enter in a controlled rotational motion. Although the complete passage isn’t shown continuously, the next moments pick up with tying on that newly placed stitch. The driver crosses the field to create a loop with the standing end; its tip then captures the short tail held near the left edge and pulls it through. Each throw is advanced and seated onto the wound with the forceps providing light, noncrushing stabilization. The operator alternates the direction of pull to square the knot and, in the final beats of the sequence, tensions both ends apart to lock the throw.

Through the mid‑video, this cadence repeats and refines. The right hand keeps the needle holder working from the central‑right, periodically regripping the needle along its body to keep it safe and oriented while no tissue passes occur. The left hand manages strand tension from the inferior‑left, occasionally steadying the instrument for a better regrip. Multiple instrument‑tie throws are formed in succession: loops around the driver, capture of the opposite limb, then deliberate, horizontal tightening across the wound that slides each throw down in a controlled, coaxial motion. When a knot is secure, the driver is briefly placed aside and the left hand inspects and adjusts the lay.

Preparation for the next stitch is deliberate. The right hand reloads the needle mid‑body with the arc perpendicular to the surface and aligned toward the next target along the central line, while the left hand controls the suture and keeps the needle tip clear. The left then brings in tissue forceps to evert the near edge again. A full, symmetric bite is taken across the central incision: entry perpendicular to the skin, pronation of the driver to follow the needle’s curvature, a mid‑pass regrip nearer the tip, and a smooth exit on the far edge. The suture is drawn through, leaving an adequate tail with no undue drag on the tissue.

Tying follows immediately, and the technique evolves slightly. The left releases the forceps after seating the edges and shifts to hold the free end; the right hand uses the driver to execute instrument throws with the needle parked on the pad. Loops are thrown, the short end is retrieved, and each throw is slid down and squared with alternating, opposing tension. As the suture line progresses superiorly, the operator blends methods—finishing one stitch with a hand tie for added security after the instrument throws—then introduces scissors with the right hand to cut the tails while the left maintains gentle approximation.

By the closing sequence, the pace eases. The right hand rests the needle holder and scissors superior to the field; both hands briefly stabilize the wooden board to reposition the pad, then the right hand lightly touches and checks the central knots. No further passes are taken. The field shows a midline incision closed with three simple interrupted sutures, knots lying centrally and evenly spaced, while lateral practice slits remain unused. Throughout, the surgeon maintains a consistent flow: precise needle loading and passage with forceps‑assisted eversion; parking and controlling the needle safely during tying; clean, squared instrument throws with alternating tension; occasional hand ties to finish; and disciplined instrument parking to keep the field clear. The result is a calm, coordinated rhythm of pass–pull‑through–tie, repeated and refined until the line is closed, followed by an unhurried inspection and tidy conclusion.
