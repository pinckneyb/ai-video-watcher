COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with quiet setup and methodical orientation. From the very first seconds, the operator establishes hand roles and a clean working field over a synthetic skin pad with several linear incisions. The right hand is predominantly the driver early on, holding a needle holder loaded correctly on the proximal third of a curved needle; the left hand begins with scissors/needle driver to remove a cover and then transitions to tissue forceps, hovering centrally and superior to the pad. The suture tail drapes across the field without tension while the needle is aligned perpendicular to the pad.

As the first target—the rightmost incision—is chosen, the hands settle into opposing positions: left hand superior-midline with forceps for gentle countertraction, right hand lateral-inferior with the driver presenting the needle perpendicular to the surface. After several small reorientations and instrument-to-instrument assists, the right hand advances the tip to the near (lower) edge just outside the incision line and begins the initial penetration following the needle’s arc. The forceps stay within millimeters of the entry point, guiding without crushing. This establishes the pattern: present the edge, drive cleanly at 90 degrees, keep the thread slack clear of the field.

Immediately afterward, control of the needle is refined. The left-hand driver assumes primary control above the rightmost wound, while the right-hand pickups capture the needle body, transfer it to the driver, and then step away to manage the free end. With the pass completed and slack straightened, the left-hand driver begins forming loops for an instrument tie while the right hand tensions the short end laterally. The knot is constructed above the incision, then snugged down evenly. This early sequence shows an efficient choreography: brief back-and-forth to regrip the needle, controlled pull-throughs, then a clean instrument tie seated directly over the wound.

The work then migrates toward the central incision. The camera catches a hand-off of the needle driver from right to left, with the right hand using forceps to load the needle properly on its body and perfect the perpendicular approach. No tissue is grasped during loading; the edges are left undisturbed until the needle is ready. Once prepared, the left-hand driver holds steady over the midline while the right-hand forceps intermittently lift or steady the near edge and help control the suture strand. Bites are taken perpendicular to the skin, the needle follows its curvature smoothly, and the suture is drawn through without tearing. The right hand steps away as needed to keep the strand from crossing the field, then returns to assist with reloading or to steady the edge for the next throw.

A rhythm emerges: load—present—drive—retrieve—pull through—tie—advance. At several points, the left-hand needle holder becomes the “post” for two-instrument ties while the right-hand instrument passes the short end through successive loops. Knots are seated by drawing the throws down in a flat, square manner directly over the incision; when necessary, the needle driver doubles as a knot pusher to advance throws and set them flush. The central incision progressively fills with evenly spaced simple interrupted sutures, the wound edges approximating without over-compression or inversion.

Between sequences, the field is occasionally empty as the operator resets. When the instruments reappear, the needle is often reloaded at the mid-to-proximal third with its concavity facing the pad, oriented for another perpendicular bite. The right hand may briefly grasp the needle tip with pickups for fine rotation, then release once the driver has a stable hold. The operator keeps loops and tails superior to the work zone, preventing tangles as stitches accumulate.

Later, with a line of knots visible along the midline, the hands return for fine control around the most recently placed stitch. The needle driver hovers superior and central; forceps approach from the right to manage suture near the knot line. At this stage, there is more needle transfer and repositioning than fresh penetration—receiving, regripping, and preparing for the next bite while respecting the spacing of existing stitches. In another passage, the team works along a right-side incision: the left-hand forceps stabilize and gently evert the edge while the right-hand driver advances the needle, then regrips near the swage to complete the pull-through along its arc. Suture is kept organized above the field and reloaded promptly for the subsequent bite.

Planning and finishing behaviors appear as the sequence matures. The right hand briefly uses a marking pen to place guide lines beside the rightmost incision, then returns to light retraction with pickups while the left-hand driver waits poised over the site. Elsewhere, after knots are seated, the left-hand scissors trim suture tails while the right hand tensions near the knot to present the ends cleanly. Tails are cut short, leaving a tidy, approximated suture line. Throughout, there are deliberate pauses to reload the needle at the inferior edge of the pad or to transfer it between hands, always keeping the working tips close to the wound and the suture strand controlled and out of the way.

By the end, the video has established a consistent, disciplined flow: careful loading with the needle grasped on its body; perpendicular, edge-respecting entries with the off hand providing just enough countertraction; smooth retrieval and pull-through with attention to thread management; reliable instrument ties seated squarely; trimming; and immediate preparation for the next stitch. Hand dominance shifts as needed to maintain optimal angles, but the principles remain constant. The result is a steady cadence of interrupted suturing across the pad—measured, methodical, and clean—punctuated by brief resets, precise regrips, and neatly finished knots.
