COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with quiet setup and orientation. The right hand arrives holding a needle driver and establishes control of the curved needle on its body, then briefly leaves the field to re‑grasp and load it properly off-screen. The left hand intermittently appears to manage the trailing suture and keep it clear of the pad. Early moments are devoted to staging: the needle lies on the right half of the pad near the right vertical incision, the left hand maintains light traction on the strand, and the right hand approaches to pick the needle up with the jaws perpendicular to the curve. No tissue is engaged yet; the operator is organizing the field and preparing the first passes.

What follows is the characteristic rhythm that persists through the case: short bursts of needle management and retrieval interleaved with deliberate knot tying. After the first unseen bite(s) are taken, the camera catches the tying sequence. Centered over the small midline slit, the right hand uses the needle holder as a tying instrument rather than for driving. The left hand holds the long limb out to the left to maintain a clear corridor. The right hand brings the jaws through the loop, captures the short tail, and pulls it through, seating a throw flat over the incision. Wrap directions alternate on subsequent throws, producing square knots. The knot is snugged with opposing, horizontal vectors so it sits on the surface without torquing the wound edges. A second instrument briefly enters but no cutting occurs in that moment.

Between these tying sequences the field often goes quiet. The idle needle rests on the pad, the driver is parked above the board, and occasionally a right‑sided instrument reaches in only to withdraw with the needle, clearing it to the periphery. At one point the left hand keeps the standing end out of the operative zone while the right hand advances from the superior‑right to re‑grasp the needle lying near the right slit; even here, the focus remains on controlled pickup rather than immediate tissue penetration. This cadence—retrieve, load, clear the strand, then tie—repeats as the interrupted stitches across the central incision are secured one by one.

Midway through, the operator’s technique becomes especially clear. The right hand deliberately uses the driver to hold or pass the short end, while the left hand provides counter‑traction on the long limb. Throws are alternated to square the knots, and each is advanced down the suture line with measured, lateral tension to avoid lifting the skin edges. The needle is occasionally reloaded for a subsequent bite, the curve oriented perpendicular to the incision and hovering just above the pad, but the actual drives are not captured; their completion is implied by the presence of new stitches needing ties. At one interval, the right hand trades the driver for scissors, bringing the blades parallel to the skin and trimming tails while the left hand stabilizes the knot—precise housekeeping that keeps the field tidy.

There is brief preparation for a potential new bite: the needle is clamped at the proximal–middle third, the left hand brings in forceps to lightly pinch and evert the near edge of the left vertical incision, then both instruments withdraw. The next frames return to tying over the central wound—again using the driver as a post, with the left hand feeding and tensioning the long suture. As additional interrupted stitches are completed, the left hand presses on and seats the knots, tidying the tails without disturbing approximation. Instruments are repeatedly parked at the superior edge between actions, reflecting disciplined field management.

As the sequence nears its end, the operator performs final adjustments. The right hand manipulates existing knots and tails over the midline, tightening and setting them; the left hand supports the board or pad edge for counter‑traction rather than grasping tissue. There is a moment of re‑centering—both hands on the wooden frame gently rotate and align the board without touching the wounds or sutures. The workspace is left organized: the needle driver and a second ring‑handled instrument rest above the pad, suture fragments lie off to the side, and the pad is stable on its pins.

The video closes on a still field. No hands are present. The central short incision is neatly approximated with three simple interrupted sutures, knots seated and tails moderately long. The longer parallel incisions lateral to the center remain open and untouched. Overall, the flow is methodical and economical: careful needle pickups and reloading, consistent instrument ties with alternating throws, precise tail trimming, and periodic field clearing and repositioning. The surgeon’s hands evolve from preparatory positioning and strand control to confident, repetitive tying motions, then to final inspection and stabilization—producing a cleanly closed central wound with steady, unhurried cadence throughout.
