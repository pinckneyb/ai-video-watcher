COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The procedure opens in a calm, organized field. Instruments are staged above and to the sides of a pinned synthetic skin pad with three parallel vertical incisions. The right hand first enters to take up the needle holder; the left hand follows with toothed forceps. With the field composed, the first actions are exploratory and deliberate: the right hand brings the loaded needle to the right-most incision while the left hand gently everts and stabilizes the near edge. The needle is held at the proximal-to-mid third and presented perpendicular to the skin, following its curvature across the wound. The tip advances through the near/right edge toward the far side as the left hand maintains a light, precise purchase on the dermis.

Momentum then shifts to the central incision, starting near its inferior end. The pair work in opposition—right hand with the driver, left with forceps—to complete a full bite across the wound. The needle is regripped as needed to maintain the 90-degree approach, and the arc is respected; the left forceps briefly meets the needle tip at the exit to guide it out cleanly. As the needle emerges through the far edge, the right hand continues to pull the suture through, then releases the needle to the left hand for safe management and repositioning. The result is a neatly bridged simple interrupted bite with entry and exit points symmetric to the wound margins.

With the first stitch placed, the technique transitions seamlessly into tying. The needle is parked on the long strand and kept out of harm’s way. The right hand uses the needle driver as a tying instrument, while the left hand controls the short end. A smooth, methodical rhythm appears: the long limb is looped to form a C around the driver’s jaws, the driver advances to grasp the short tail, and the hands separate in opposite directions to lay down the first throw squarely over the incision. Without crowding the tissue, alternating wraps follow—counter-wraps to reverse direction—each seated with balanced, planar tension. The knot cinches centrally with the wound edges approximated but not crushed. The right hand briefly sets the driver aside so the left can apply final tension, then scissors come in to trim the tails to length. Immediately, the right hand reloads a fresh needle offered by the left, gripping it again at the proximal-to-mid body, perpendicular and ready.

This cadence—place, tie, cut, reload—repeats as the work progresses superiorly along the central incision. At the lower third, the right hand drives an outside-in pass through the far (image right) edge while the left hand hovers with Adsons on the near (image left) side to anticipate the exit. In one sequence the far edge is pierced and the needle is brought into the wound gap; in the next, the complementary pass and pull-through are completed between frames, and the team immediately transitions to tying. The right hand, still on the driver, stands the instrument up over the wound to act as a post. The left hand locates and presents the short tail close to the knot site. The driver’s tip dives into the loop, retrieves the tail, and the throw slides down smoothly. Subsequent throws alternate orientation to square the knot. The left hand provides steady counter-tension while the right advances and retracts over the centerline to capture the tail for each throw. The knot is seated gently each time, leaving the edges neatly approximated. Scissors return to nip the tails; the left maintains light tension to prevent loosening as the cut is made. The right reloads the needle from the left hand for the next bite.

Moving to the mid-portion of the central wound, the technique becomes even more economical. The left hand, now regularly using forceps, pinches and everts the target edge 3–5 mm from the margin while the right positions the needle at a true right angle. The pass is executed with minimal wrist twist, following the curve through the dermis. After emergence, the right hand regrips the needle on its body to continue the pull-through without snagging, then reorients it for the return bite. Suture management is tidy: the long limb is kept clear to the operator’s right, then swept across as needed to avoid entanglement. With the stitch laid, the driver moves from needle work to knot work. The left hand releases the forceps to manage the free end with fingers as the right hand sets the knot—first a firm throw to approximate, then alternating throws to lock—seating it centrally without overtightening. The driver is set aside and the knot is finished by hand tension; cutting follows, again with the left maintaining gentle traction.

Attention then turns to the right-sided incision. The right hand receives the needle from the left, establishing the familiar perpendicular orientation while the left hand returns to the Adsons to create a small, everted target. There’s a brief setup phase—tip alignment, spacing, and slack control—before the pass proceeds. As the needle traverses, the left forceps stabilize the exit edge with minimal compression. The driver then grasps near the swage to extract the needle cleanly through the far side. With the stitch placed, the left hand releases the forceps and switches to tail control; the right immediately transitions the driver to instrument ties. A generous loop is cast across the wound; the driver passes through, captures the short end, and draws it through for the first throw. The hands switch tension gracefully to seat the throw. Additional throws alternate direction, mirroring the earlier cadence. The knot lands square and central, edges aligned, after which the driver is exchanged for scissors. The right hand trims the tails while the left keeps the suture steady.

The sequence closes with a brief pause. The instruments are parked superior to the field, and both hands step away. For a moment, the operator steadies the wooden base with gloved fingertips at the edges, confirming the work is stable. The central incision now bears a tidy row of simple interrupted sutures with short, even tails; the right incision has been addressed, and the remaining lateral incision remains open, untouched in this interval.

Across the case, the flow is consistent and controlled:
- Right hand leads with the needle driver for precise, perpendicular entries, regripping the needle at the correct third to respect the arc and avoid torque.
- Left hand alternates between forceps for edge eversion and fingers for suture management, stepping in only when needed to guide needle exit or control the short tail.
- Tying is performed as instrument ties with the driver, using clear C and reverse-C loops, with throws seated in-plane over the wound to maintain alignment.
- Each stitch follows a repeatable cycle—place, pull-through, tie, cut, reload—creating an efficient rhythm that moves from the inferior to the superior aspects of the central incision before addressing the adjacent wound.

The result is a methodical, measured closure that privileges gentle tissue handling, clean approximation, and disciplined instrument transitions.
