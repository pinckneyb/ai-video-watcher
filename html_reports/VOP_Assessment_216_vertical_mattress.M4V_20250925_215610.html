<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 216_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components are executed with consistent, perpendicular needle entry and predictable arc; dermal support appears adequate and epidermal approximation is reliable.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic with single, precise grasping and consistent gentle eversion using toothed pickups and occasional fingertip control.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are constructed deliberately with controlled throws, consistently seated and dressed with short tails trimmed—overall secure and appropriate for skin closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension is well balanced—deep support without puckering and superficial throws approximate epidermis with slight, consistent eversion rather than excessive tightness.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals are uniform and orderly along the incision, consistent with spacing within the 0.5–1.0 cm target.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is present and consistent across the closure, producing a slightly raised margin appropriate for anticipated healing.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is strong—hands and instruments remain close to the wound with a steady, efficient bimanual rhythm and minimal extraneous movement.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.1/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrated a competent, controlled vertical mattress closure with reliable pass symmetry, consistent spacing, and excellent tissue handling. Needle control and mid‑shaft gripping produced predictable perpendicular entries; instrument choreography maintained fine control and minimized trauma. Knots were tied deliberately and seated securely, with appropriate tail management. Tension balance between deep and superficial components was well managed—deep support without tissue strangulation and superficial throws providing uniform slight eversion for optimal epidermal apposition. Overall the performance reflects proficient technique suitable for clinical skin closure, with only minor opportunities for refinement in speed and micro‑efficiency of knot transitions.</div>
