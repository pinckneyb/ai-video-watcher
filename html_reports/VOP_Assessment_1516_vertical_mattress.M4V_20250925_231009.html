<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1516_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) components were executed in a controlled, perpendicular manner with dermal support and epidermal approximation evident along the entire closure. Passes produced consistent layer capture and appropriate wound edge alignment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was gentle and deliberate with a single precise grasp used to evert and present each edge and no repeated traumatic grabs observed. Forceps control minimized unnecessary traction on the model.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently constructed with additional throws for security and tails trimmed appropriately; knots appeared square and held tension without slippage. Knot placement was regular and close to the wound line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure was well managed—deep support maintained coaptation while superficial throws produced slight, purposeful eversion without over-tightening. Occasional minor puckering was corrected during final adjustments.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Suture spacing along the incision was uniform and fell within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm interval for interrupted vertical mattress closure. Intervals were consistent from superior to inferior.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was consistently achieved at each bite, producing a visible raised ridge and preventing inversion of the epidermal edges. Overall eversion quality was appropriate for skin approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was efficient with hands and instruments maintained close to the operative site, a steady rhythm of pass → tie → trim, and minimal unnecessary repositioning. Workflow was methodical and focused.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a disciplined vertical mattress closure with consistent technique throughout the single incision. Needle handling, forceps presentation, and stitch placement produced repeatable dermal support and superficial approximation with reliable eversion; knots were secure and trimmed neatly. Motion was economical and instrument mechanics were appropriate for skin closure. Minor issues were limited to occasional localized puckering at individual knots and brief variations in grip when negotiating tight turns, both of which were recognized and adjusted during the final tightening sequence. Overall this is a proficient, well-executed vertical mattress performance with sound tissue handling, balanced tension, and uniform spacing.</div>
