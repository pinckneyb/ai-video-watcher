<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) components are executed in a consistent, controlled fashion with perpendicular-to-oblique needle entry and clear layer recognition leading to reliable dermal support and epidermal approximation. Needle handling and trajectory demonstrate appropriate orientation for both supporting and superficial bites.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic and restrained; forceps provide single precise grasps to evert and present the edge without repeated crushing or excessive manipulation. Hands rest lightly for stability and reengage efficiently.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are methodical with multiple throws producing a consistent, square-appearing stack and secure seating across stitches; knot placement is close to the wound and tensioned uniformly.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance is well managed—deep bites provide evident support while superficial components close the epidermis without puckering or excessive strangulation, maintaining uniform approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing between interrupted vertical mattress stitches is consistent and closely set along the incision, falling within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm range for reliable edge support.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved with a slight, appropriate ridge along the closure; no inversion or gaping is evident and the skin margins remain well apposed.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is good—hands and instruments remain concentrated at the operative site with minimal extraneous movement and efficient transitions between passes and knot-tying.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a competent vertical mattress closure with consistent technique from start to finish. Needle orientation, controlled rotations, and forceps-assisted edge presentation produced uniform, slightly everted margins and dependable dermal support, while knot stacks were secure and placed close to the wound. Spacing was even and tension between deep and superficial components was balanced, avoiding epidermal strangulation or wound gapping. Overall the performance demonstrates reliable mastery of the vertical mattress principles with efficient, atraumatic tissue handling and reproducible knot security. For progression to excellence, focus on incremental refinement of speed without sacrificing control and continued vigilance to maintain identical bite depth across all stitches.</div>
