<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1416_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) components were executed with consistent perpendicularity and symmetric tissue capture, producing reliable dermal support and epidermal apposition. Passes demonstrate controlled arc and predictable placement.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is precise and economical with single, deliberate grasps and minimal tissue trauma; forceps/fingertip presentation is used appropriately to evert and stabilize edges. Occasional brief releases for transfers did not compromise tissue control.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently seated on the surface, secured with appropriate throws and trimmed to tidy lengths; knot construction appears square and stable across the line. There is uniformity in knot placement and security.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between the deep and superficial components is well managed—deep support without overcompression and superficial throws approximating epidermis with slight intentional eversion. Minor puckering was noted at few bites but was recognized and corrected.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch spacing is uniform and within the 0.5–1.0 cm target throughout the incision, with consistent offsetting to avoid entanglement with adjacent knots. The overall suture interval is regular and symmetric.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved along the closure producing a slight raised ridge without inversion; cosmetic edge alignment is preserved across the line. Eversion quality is deliberate and reproducible.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is excellent—hands and instruments remain in a compact working envelope with efficient paired movements, rapid needle transfers, and minimal extraneous repositioning. Workflow is disciplined and time‑efficient.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.1/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrates proficient vertical mattress technique with reliable deep support and consistent superficial approximation. Pass symmetry, spacing, and perpendicular needle trajectories yield dependable edge apposition and reproducible eversion; knot construction is secure and uniformly placed. Tensioning is balanced—deep bites provide structural lift while superficial throws approximate the epidermis without overt strangulation, though isolated minor puckering required adjustment. Overall performance reflects deliberate, efficient instrument handling and excellent economy of motion. The operator produces a cosmetically sound, mechanically secure repair with tidy tail management and thoughtful intraoperative adjustments; with continued attention to eliminating the occasional puckered bite this is a high‑quality execution of the vertical mattress technique.</div>
