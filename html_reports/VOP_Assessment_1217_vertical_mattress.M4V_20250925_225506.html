<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1217_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) support and superficial (near‑near) closure were executed in a consistent, perpendicular trajectory across the wound with predictable entry/exit geometry and reliable edge purchase. Overall pass execution provides appropriate layered support and epidermal approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was precise and controlled with single, targeted forceps grasps at the wound edge and minimal unnecessary manipulations. There was consistent gentle traction and no evidence of repeated rough handling.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently formed, tensioned, and trimmed with good security and uniform placement at each stitch; throws appeared square and maintained approximation without slippage. Knot technique was reliable and reproducible across the suture line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure was well maintained, producing firm subcutaneous support with only gentle epidermal approximation and no blanching or overtightening. The superficial component closed skin without excessive inversion or gapping.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch spacing was uniform and within desirable cosmetic parameters, with intervals appearing consistently between roughly 0.5–1.0 cm along the incision. The resultant row of sutures produced an even line without irregular gaps.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was consistently achieved at each stitch, producing a subtle and uniform outward tilt of the epidermal edges and preventing inversion. The closure demonstrates cosmetically appropriate ridge formation along the suture line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was efficient: both hands remained in a compact working corridor with minimal extraneous movements, steady instrument exchanges, and a methodical stitch rhythm. Workflow was deliberate and time‑efficient for reproducible placement.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator executed the vertical mattress technique in a methodical, proficient manner with consistent pass symmetry, predictable perpendicularity to the wound edges, and uniform spacing. Tissue handling was gentle and precise, with the nondominant hand providing controlled eversion and the dominant hand delivering reproducible needle arcs and reliable knot formation. Knot security and placement were consistent, maintaining approximation without slippage. Tension between deep support and superficial closure was well balanced—deep support provided structural apposition while superficial throws approximated the epidermis without excessive tightness. Overall motion economy and instrument control were strong, yielding a neat, evenly everted closure appropriate for a cosmetic skin approximation.</div>
