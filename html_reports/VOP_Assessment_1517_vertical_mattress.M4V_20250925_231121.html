<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1517_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components were executed in a consistent, controlled manner with needle trajectories perpendicular-to-slightly oblique to the wound and reproducible dermal purchase across stitches; deep support and superficial closure appeared coordinated.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was deliberate and atraumatic with a single precise grasp used to evert and present each margin, minimal unnecessary re-grasping, and steady instrument contact.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were placed consistently and managed tidily with secure-appearing throws and appropriate loop control before trimming; definitive square knot configuration cannot be fully visualized but security is evident.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tensioning showed good balance—deep support maintained wound coaptation while superficial throws produced epidermal approximation without excessive strangulation, though occasional localized puckering required adjustment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing between interrupted sutures was uniform and within the desired 0.5–1.0 cm range along the entire incision.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure exhibited consistent mild-to-moderate eversion at each stitch with an aligned raised ridge and no inversion of the wound edges.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion was efficient and economical with hands and instruments maintained within a compact working zone, minimal extraneous movement, and only occasional brief off‑field manipulation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.1/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed an orderly, well-controlled vertical mattress closure with consistent pass symmetry, reliable perpendicular needle trajectories, and uniform spacing. Tissue handling was precise and atraumatic, instrument coordination between needle driver and forceps was excellent, and knots were consistently managed to maintain secure approximation. Tension balance between the deep and superficial components was appropriate—deep support held the wound without over-tightening while superficial throws achieved close epidermal apposition with mild eversion. Overall technique is proficient and efficient; minor localized puckering was recognized and actively mitigated, but vigilance is required to avoid cumulative tissue bunching when placing adjacent stitches.</div>
