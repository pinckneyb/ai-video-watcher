<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 715_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) components were executed in a consistent, controlled manner with perpendicular-to-oblique needle trajectories yielding appropriate layer purchase and reliable edge coaptation. Pass symmetry and perpendicularity to the wound edges were maintained across the suture line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was atraumatic and precise; the nondominant forceps provided single, well‑placed grasps with minimal crush and efficient needle reception. Edge control was maintained without repeated or excessive forceps repositioning.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently formed, secure and placed on the surface with appropriate, controlled throws and trimmed tails; there was no evidence of loose or insecure knotting. Knot technique avoided over‑tightening while maintaining security.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension between deep support and superficial closure was well balanced—deep components provided firm approximation while superficial throws achieved epidermal apposition without ischemic blanching or puckering. Overall tension management preserved tissue perfusion and alignment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Inter‑stitch spacing was uniform and within the 0.5–1.0 cm range, producing an even line of sutures with consistent intervals along the incision. Spacing contributed to a regular cosmetic result.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was consistently achieved with a slight, appropriate ridge along the closure and no inversion of the epidermal edges; eversion was preserved during knot tying. The ridge was uniform across the suture line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was good with hands and instruments remaining close to the work area, becoming more fluent as the case progressed and minimizing unnecessary repositioning. Brief instrument adjustments did not disrupt workflow or efficiency.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator executed a competent vertical mattress closure with reliable pass symmetry, precise tissue handling, and consistent knot security. Deep and superficial components functioned together to produce uniform, slightly everted edges without gaping, excess tension, or tissue bunching; overall tension balance maintained dermal support while minimizing epidermal ischemia. Instrument control and hand choreography were efficient and improved through the case, yielding evenly spaced sutures and a neat cosmetic line. This performance demonstrates proficient technique appropriate for clinical closure, with minor room for refinement to reach exemplary (top‑tier) speed and finesse.</div>
