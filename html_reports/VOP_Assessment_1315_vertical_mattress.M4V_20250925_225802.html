<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1315_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) components were executed in a consistent, methodical pattern with needle passes perpendicular to the wound edges and appropriate dermal purchase producing reliable layer apposition. Entry/exit points were symmetric and aligned along the incision.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was controlled with the forceps regularly presenting and everting the near edge with single, precise grasps; occasional brief instrument exchanges did not result in repeated traumatic grabs. Overall soft, deliberate manipulation minimized unnecessary handling.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently constructed, sequentially tightened, and seated with appropriate security; throws appeared neat and maintained tension without evidence of slippage or over‑cinching. Knot placement was close to the skin surface and uniform across stitches.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure was well managed—the closure demonstrated firm underlying support with superficial bites approximating skin without strangulation. Occasional small adjustments were made to avoid over‑tightening.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing between interrupted sutures was uniform and within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm range, creating an even line of closure with consistent interval symmetry.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was consistently achieved at each stitch, producing a slight raised ridge and preventing inversion of the epidermal edges across the incision.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motions were economical and focused—hands and instruments remained close to the wound with minimal departures, efficient instrument exchanges, and steady rhythm from placement through knot tying.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrated proficient vertical mattress technique with consistent pass symmetry, controlled needle handling, and reliable eversion. Bite placement and spacing were uniform, knots were secure and neatly seated, and tissue handling was gentle and deliberate throughout, producing a tidy, well‑approximated line. Tension was well balanced between deep and superficial components, providing substantive support without epidermal strangulation. Movements were economical and coordinated, with minor handedness shifts that did not degrade technique—overall a competent, repeatable performance appropriate for clinical application with attention to maintaining this high standard under operative conditions.</div>
