<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1015_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components are executed with consistent, perpendicular needle trajectories and reliable dermal purchase; closures demonstrate appropriate layer support and epidermal apposition. Overall passes are competent and anatomically appropriate for a vertical mattress.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is precise with single, controlled grasps using fine-toothed forceps and minimal visible trauma; occasional brief forceps pressure produced minor gouging on the practice pad but did not compromise edge apposition.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently constructed, tightened, and trimmed with secure appearance and uniform placement; throws are appropriate and maintain closure without slippage.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial approximation is well controlled—deep bites provide support while superficial components are not over-tightened, yielding stable closure without ischemic puckering.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals are uniform and fall within an appropriate 0.5–1.0 cm range along the entire incision, producing even distribution of closure forces.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Wound edges display consistent, slight-to-moderate eversion across the repair with no evidence of inversion; the ridge is uniform and indicates effective superficial bite technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is strong—hands and instruments remain close to the work, exchanges are efficient, and there are minimal extraneous movements or interruptions.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The suturing demonstrates proficient vertical mattress execution with consistent pass symmetry, uniform spacing, and controlled perpendicular needle orientation. Tissue handling is precise with effective forceps control and minimal trauma; knots are secure and uniformly placed. Tension is well balanced between deep support and superficial approximation, producing consistent slight eversion without puckering or edge ischemia. Workflow and instrument choreography are efficient and deliberate, with tight bimanual coordination and minimal wasted motion. Overall this is a competent, reproducible closure consistent with strong surgical technique; attention to further minimizing forceps pressure on delicate tissue would refine an already effective performance.</div>
