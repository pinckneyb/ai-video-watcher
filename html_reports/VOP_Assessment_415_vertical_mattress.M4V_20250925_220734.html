<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 415_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) passes are executed in a consistent, perpendicular-to-oblique manner with controlled needle arcs and regular regrips to optimize purchase. Technique demonstrates reliable layered support and epidermal capture consistent with competent vertical mattress execution.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic with fine toothed forceps used to tent and evert edges, minimal dragging, and single precise grasps for each bite. Regrips are purposeful rather than rough, indicating careful soft‑tissue respect.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are instrument‑assisted, consistently secured, held in position while tails are trimmed, and exhibit appropriate tension without evidence of slippage. Overall knot construction appears square and reliable.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial approximation is well managed—deep support appears to bear the load while superficial throws gently evert and oppose the epidermis without cutting in. There is no obvious epidermal strangulation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing is generally uniform along the incision with most intervals approximating the target range, though a few bites are slightly closer than ideal, producing minor variability. Overall spacing is acceptable but not perfectly regular.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently present with mild to moderate ridge formation at multiple bites, preventing inversion and promoting optimal epidermal edge apposition. Eversion quality is clear and maintained across the closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is mostly efficient with hands and instruments kept close to the wound and repeated, purposeful movements; however intermittent pauses and brief instrument parking produce small interruptions in flow.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.7/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrates a proficient vertical mattress technique with consistent, controlled needle handling, deliberate regrips, and reliable layered purchase. Tissue handling is atraumatic, knots are secure and well managed, and the superficial components produce consistent eversion without evidence of epidermal strangulation. Deep versus superficial tension appears balanced, with deep support shouldering closure and superficial throws achieving good edge apposition. Minor deficiencies are limited to small variability in bite spacing and occasional pauses/parking of instruments that interrupt kinetic flow but do not compromise closure quality. Overall this is a competent, reproducible vertical mattress closure suitable for clinical application with attention to more uniform spacing and slightly smoother workflow for optimal efficiency.</div>
