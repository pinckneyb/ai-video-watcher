<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> simple_interrupted_IMG_3186.MOV</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Simple Interrupted</p>
<div class='rubric-point'>1. <strong>Perpendicular needle passes</strong>: Needle was consistently oriented perpendicular and poised for symmetric bites, but no actual tissue passes were performed to verify true 90Â° entry/exit or symmetry. <strong>2/5 competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>2. <strong>Gentle tissue handling</strong>: Forceps were used gently at the dermal edge with minimal crush and primarily for eversion; intermittent re-grasps occurred but without overt trauma. <strong>3/5 proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>3. <strong>Square, secure knots</strong>: Existing knots sat lateral to the wound, held under tension without slippage, and tails were trimmed appropriately; knot tying was not observed, so squareness cannot be confirmed. <strong>3/5 proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>4. <strong>Appropriate approximation/tension</strong>: The four sutures approximated the upper segment with mild eversion, but a residual inferior gap remained and occasional puckering appeared with line tensioning. <strong>2/5 competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>5. <strong>Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong>: The four placed sutures were evenly spaced among themselves, but the unclosed inferior segment disrupted uniform spacing across the line. <strong>2/5 competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>6. <strong>Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable)</strong>: Edge profile was consistently slightly everted along the sutured segment with no inversion noted. <strong>3/5 proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>7. <strong>Economy of time and motion</strong>: There was extensive setup, hand switching, and instrument parking without progressing to an additional stitch; efficiency suffered despite hands staying near the field. <strong>2/5 competent</strong></div>
<br>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.4/5 competent</strong></div>
<br>
<div class='summative-comment'><strong>Summative Comment:</strong> This was a cautious, organized setup with good instrument control and deliberate tissue presentation, but the lack of an executed pass and tie stalled progress. The final state remained at four interrupted sutures with an inferior gap, indicating incomplete closure despite appropriate planning and tidy line maintenance. Hand coordination was adequate and orientations were consistently perpendicular, but execution did not match preparation.</div>
