<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 617_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) components were executed in a consistent, controlled fashion with needle arcs and bite placement demonstrating perpendicular, supportive purchase and reliable epidermal approximation. Technique shows proficient dual-layer function with predictable layer support.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was atraumatic with single precise forceps grasps, minimal crushing, and consistent opposing instrument control to evert and steady edges. Handling demonstrates careful, efficient manipulation without excessive re-grasps.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were secured and positioned with appropriate tension; final hand-tied throws produced low-profile, firm knots though some were completed manually rather than with instruments. Overall knot security appears reliable.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure was well controlled — deep component provided support while superficial bites approximated the epidermis without overt blanching or puckering. The line shows appropriate distribution of tension.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch spacing was uniform and within the desired 0.5–1.0 cm range along the entire incision, producing an even, regular closure. Interval consistency was maintained throughout.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was consistently achieved with a subtle, appropriate raised ridge along the closure and no evidence of inversion. Skin edges were well apposed with cosmetically favorable eversion.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was good with compact hand positions, short working arcs, and smooth instrument exchanges; brief attention to adjacent defects introduced minor inefficiencies but did not disrupt the primary workflow.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The procedure demonstrates a proficient vertical mattress closure with reliable execution of deep and superficial passes, uniform spacing, and consistent eversion. Instrument control and tissue handling were careful and efficient, producing even apposition without excessive tension or tissue trauma. Knot construction and final security were adequate, with low-profile knots and appropriate placement. Minor inefficiencies were noted when the operator briefly attended adjacent sites and when final knots were completed by direct manual manipulation rather than instrument tying, but these did not compromise the integrity or tension balance of the closure. Overall performance is competent and reproducible, suitable for clinical application with continued attention to minimizing off-line activity and maintaining instrument-based knotting when visualization of security is essential.</div>
