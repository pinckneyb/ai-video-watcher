<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1418_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes were executed in a consistent, reproducible manner with perpendicular-to-oblique needle orientation and controlled needle arcs producing reliable dermal purchase and epidermal approximation. Overall pass symmetry and layer capture were appropriate for vertical mattress technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was careful with stable countertraction and minimal crush injury; forceps grasps were deliberate and generally singular per edge though occasional firmer tents were used to ensure purchase. Overall handling preserved tissue integrity.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently secured and maintained even tension across the line; exact throw configuration and tail management were not fully visualized but knot security appears adequate based on maintained apposition. Given limited visibility of final throws, knot construction is satisfactory.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial approximation was well managed — deep elements provided support while superficial components produced gentle epidermal apposition without evidence of ischemic blanching. Eversion was controlled, not over-tightened.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Suture spacing was uniform and appropriate for the wound length, with intervals falling within the 0.5–1.0 cm target and consistent lateral placement along the incision. Spacing supported even distribution of tension.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion quality was consistently present across the closure, producing a slight, appropriate ridge to counteract later inversion and promote epidermal edge contact. No focal inversion or gaping was observed.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy was excellent — hands and instruments remained close to the work, movements were efficient and methodical, and there were minimal extraneous departures from the suture line. Workflow supported steady progress and control.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a methodical, well-controlled vertical mattress closure with consistent pass symmetry, reliable tissue purchase, and uniform spacing. Needle handling and opposing-hand countertraction were precise, producing reproducible slight eversion and secure epidermal approximation across the entire incision. Tension distribution between deep support and superficial closure was balanced, avoiding over-tightening while maintaining wound apposition. Knot security appeared adequate though final throw detail and tail management were not fully visualized; overall technique demonstrates proficient competency with efficient instrument economy and good tissue respect.</div>
