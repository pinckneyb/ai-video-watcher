<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 115_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Dual-component vertical mattress technique is executed consistently with controlled, perpendicular needle trajectories and appropriate layer engagement; deep support and superficial approximation appear present per instruction assumptions. Overall pass execution shows deliberate, reproducible technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is precise with tip-only forceps traction and minimal redundant grasps; occasional fingertip stabilization and hemostat use are appropriate adaptations rather than rough handling. Handling is atraumatic and controlled.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are repeatedly formed in an iterative, controlled manner with secure tensioning and consistent placement adjacent to the wound; minor variability in final tail arrangement does not compromise security. Knot technique is reliable.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial approximation is well managed — deep component provides support while superficial throws produce epidermal apposition without excessive strangulation; small residual gaps are corrected by sequential tightening. Overall tensioning is appropriate.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing is generally uniform and within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm range with systematic sequential placement; occasional slight interval variability is minor and does not impair closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently produced along the closure, yielding a modest raised ridge without inversion and promoting good epidermal edge apposition. Eversion quality is good.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is excellent — hands and instruments remain close to the wound with tight, efficient two‑instrument choreography and minimal off‑task movements. Workflow is methodical and time‑conserving.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrates a proficient, reproducible vertical mattress closure with controlled needle handling, reliable tissue presentation, and consistent eversion. Pass symmetry and spacing are systematic and appropriate; knot construction and placement are secure and handled with predictable technique. Tensioning shows good balance between deep support and superficial approximation, with only minor residual irregularities corrected by sequential tightening. Overall this is a competent performance suitable for clinical closure: instrument control and economy of motion are strong, tissue handling is atraumatic, and the suture line exhibits consistent eversion and apposition. Attention to slightly more uniform interval spacing and meticulous final tail management would elevate the technique but are not essential for adequacy in this recording.</div>
