<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 417_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components were executed with controlled, repeatable needle arcs and perpendicular-to-oblique entries producing reliable dermal purchase and edge apposition. Technique produced appropriate deep support and superficial closure across the active line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue was handled with precise, bimanual control using a single, consistent grasp per edge with controlled eversion; occasional minor adjustments did not produce tissue trauma.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently formed, tightened on the superficial surface and trimmed with appropriate security and placement; knot technique appeared reliable and uniform.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance was well controlled—deep support maintained alignment while superficial throws closed the epidermis without excessive strangulation; minor local variability did not cause puckering.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing between stitches was generally uniform and within the 0.5–1.0 cm target, with only modest, acceptable variation in a few sites.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrated consistent mild-to-moderate eversion along the incision, creating an appropriate raised ridge without inversion.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion was economical and compact with instruments remaining close to the wound and coordinated bimanual activity; occasional crossings and brief instrument exchanges did not disrupt workflow.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The surgeon executed the vertical mattress line with disciplined, bimanual technique producing consistent dermal purchase, reliable edge apposition, and predictable eversion. Needle handling and forceps control were precise, with small, efficient motions and appropriate adjustments as the field became crowded with previous sutures. Knot formation and trimming were secure and uniform, and tensioning demonstrated good balance between deeper support and superficial approximation without skin strangulation or significant puckering. Overall this is a competent, proficient vertical mattress performance with minor, acceptable variations in bite depth and spacing that do not compromise the integrity of the closure.</div>
