<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) components are executed in a reproducible, controlled fashion with consistent needle arcs and perpendicular-to-oblique orientations yielding reliable layer capture. Pass geometry and perpendicularity support deep support with superficial epidermal approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is gentle and deliberate; the non‑needle hand consistently tents and everts with single precise grasps, transitioning appropriately between forceps and fingertip control without excessive re‑grasping. Minimal crush or aggressive manipulation is observed.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are constructed as instrument ties, tightened to a consistent degree and seated centrally over each bite; they appear secure with appropriate tail management and spacing. No loose or obviously insecure knots are present.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure is generally appropriate — deep tension provides apposition while superficial throws avoid skin strangulation in most sites, though occasional slightly higher knot tension produced minor localized puckering.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch spacing is uniform and measured along the entire column, with intervals consistently within the 0.5–1.0 cm target range. The line of approximation is regular and symmetric.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is present and consistent at each bite, producing a slight beneficial ridge without inversion; a few areas show modest over‑eversion/puckering where tension was higher.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is strong: hands and instruments remain compactly opposed over the wound, instrument exchanges decrease over time, and the operator progresses with a smooth, efficient cadence. Minimal off‑field movement is observed.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.1/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>Overall execution of the vertical mattress sequence is proficient and methodical. Passes are symmetric and well‑placed with controlled needle handling and predictable arc trajectories; spacing is uniform and knot placement is consistent. Tissue handling is careful, with effective use of forceps and fingertip tension to achieve reproducible eversion and dermal purchase. Tension management is generally well balanced—deep support provides structural closure while superficial components approximate the epidermis without widespread ischemia. Minor technical refinements would address occasional localized over‑tightening that produced slight puckering, but the closure demonstrates competent technique, secure knots, good eversion, and efficient motion appropriate for clinical application.</div>
