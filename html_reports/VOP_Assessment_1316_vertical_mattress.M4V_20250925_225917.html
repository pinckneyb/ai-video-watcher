<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1316_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far–far) and superficial (near–near) passes were executed with consistent perpendicular entry and exit, producing predictable support and epidermal capture across the line. Bite depths and needle arcs were repeatable and appropriate for layered vertical mattress support.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was controlled and gentle; forceps were used precisely with limited, purposeful grasping and without repeated traumatic re-grasps. Movements demonstrated good respect for edge integrity throughout.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently constructed and seated using a mix of instrument-assisted and fingertip technique; throws were secure with minimal loosening and tails trimmed appropriately. Overall knot security was reliable for skin closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure was well managed—deep components provided support while superficial limbs were tightened to approximate without obvious ischemic blanching. Occasional minor adjustments were required and made promptly.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing was generally even and within the desirable 0.5–1.0 cm range with only minor variability between a few adjacent stitches that was corrected during the run. Overall interval uniformity preserved wound alignment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was consistently achieved at each stitch, producing a modest raised ridge without inversion; epidermal edges were well opposed when knots were seated.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was good—hands and instruments remained close to the operative field with minimal extraneous movement and efficient alternation between needle passage and knot tying. Workflow demonstrated purposeful rhythm and time-effective technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrates a proficient vertical mattress technique with repeatable, well-controlled needle handling, predictable bite symmetry, and effective eversion. Deep and superficial components functioned together to provide supportive tissue approximation while the superficial limbs were tightened judiciously to achieve epidermal apposition without overt strangulation. Knot construction and tissue management were reliable, and the operator maintained efficient, coordinated motion throughout. Minor variability in spacing and occasional transient gapping were recognized and corrected intra-procedure; overall this is a competent, reproducible execution appropriate for reliable skin edge approximation.</div>
