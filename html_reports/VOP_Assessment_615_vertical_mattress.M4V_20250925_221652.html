<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 615_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) support and superficial (near‑near) closure are consistently delivered with perpendicular-to-oblique needle orientation and appropriate layer purchase, producing reliable tissue coaptation. Passes demonstrate controlled arcs and repeatable technique along the incision.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic with precise, limited forceps grasps and minimal manipulation per bite; the operator uses fingertip counter‑traction appropriately. There is no evidence of repetitive crushing or excessive regrasping.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are compact, consistently formed, and lie appropriately on the skin surface with trimmed tails; throws appear secure and uniform across stitches. Knot technique is reliable and reproducible.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tensioning shows balanced deep support with gentler superficial approximation—deep components maintain alignment without strangulation while superficial throws preserve epidermal apposition. Overall tension control is appropriate and consistent.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing between mattress stitches is uniform and falls within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm interval, producing an even line of approximation. Interval consistency is maintained from first to last stitch.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is uniformly achieved with a slight, desirable ridge along the closure and no inversion of wound edges. The eversion is consistent and cosmetically appropriate.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is excellent—hands and instruments remain close to the wound, motions are efficient and rhythmic, and there are minimal extraneous movements or repositioning. Workflow is methodical and time‑efficient.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.3/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrates proficient vertical mattress technique with consistent pass symmetry, controlled needle arcs, and uniform spacing. Tissue handling is atraumatic and deliberate, producing reliable epidermal apposition with a sustained slight eversion and no evidence of edge inversion or overtightening. Knots are secure and neatly trimmed, contributing to a tidy, reproducible suture line. Tension balance between deep support and superficial approximation is well managed, with the deep component providing structural apposition and the superficial component avoiding strangulation of the epidermis. Instrument control and economy of motion are strong, yielding an efficient, high‑quality repair appropriate for clinical practice. Minor refinements could elevate this to exemplary, but the performance is fundamentally competent and reliable.</div>
