<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 616_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) components are executed in a consistent vertical mattress pattern with perpendicular, controlled needle trajectories that support dermal approximation and epidermal closure. Passes are deliberate and placed to provide deep support and superficial apposition.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic with single, precise forceps grasps to evert and stabilize edges; no evidence of crushing or repeated rough manipulations.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently constructed and secured with systematic square‑knot technique and appropriate seating before trimming, producing stable fixation of each stitch.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tensioning demonstrates balanced deep support with superficial bites closed without excessive blanching or puckering; final line shows maintained edge apposition.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Sutures are placed at uniform intervals along the incision, with spacing consistent and appropriate for cutaneous closure within the 0.5–1.0 cm target.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure exhibits consistent slight eversion along the suture line with no inversion of margins, producing a favorable coaptation profile.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Hand and instrument motions are compact and economical with minimal unnecessary excursions; occasional brief repositioning for suture management did not degrade overall efficiency.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.3/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a methodical, controlled vertical mattress closure with reliable pass execution, predictable needle control, and consistent edge eversion. Deep and superficial components functioned together to provide supportive tissue approximation while the superficial bites achieved precise epidermal coaptation without over‑tensioning. Knot technique and tissue handling were strong—square, secure knots were tied and tails managed promptly—resulting in a neat, uniformly approximated suture line. Overall competence is high: technique is proficient with minor workflow variability related to suture management rather than any deficit in mechanical execution.</div>
