<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 618_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components are effectively executed with perpendicular entry and delivery; the line demonstrates supportive deep purchase and reliable epidermal approximation. Passes are consistently placed to provide deep support and superficial closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is gentle and deliberate with single, precise forceps grasps and minimal repeated pinching; margins are lifted and everted without crush or excess traction.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently constructed with short, controlled throws, well-seated and tensioned to maintain approximation without strangulation. Knot security and placement are reliable across the row.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension between the deep and superficial components is well balanced—deep support appears to bear the load while superficial throws approximate epidermis with slight eversion and no visible puckering.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals are uniform and fall within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm range, producing a regular, evenly spaced row.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved along the closure with a gentle, raised ridge and no inversion of the edges; skin alignment is cosmetically favorable.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is strong—hands remain close to the wound, instrument crossings are controlled, and the operator advances through a tight, efficient pass–tie–trim workflow.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrates proficient execution of the vertical mattress concept with reliable deep support and precise superficial approximation. Passes are symmetric and evenly spaced, tissue handling is atraumatic, knots are secure and consistently seated, and eversion is achieved throughout without overt strangulation or gapping. Overall motion economy and instrument control are efficient and appropriate for a refined skin closure. This performance meets a high standard of technical competence with only minor, expected small refinements in needle grasp and approach—acceptable in practice but to be continuously tightened toward excellence.</div>
