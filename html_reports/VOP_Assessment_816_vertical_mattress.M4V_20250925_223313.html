<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 816_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Dual-pass vertical mattress execution appears consistent with full‑thickness dermal purchase and perpendicular-to-oblique needle trajectory; bites are deliberate and appropriately oriented to support both deep and superficial components. Pass symmetry is good along the line with no obvious misdirected throws.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic and precise, with consistent use of fine toothed forceps for single controlled grasps and occasional confident fingertip suture control to minimize instrument exchanges. Handling preserved tissue integrity throughout.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are methodical, consistently secured and tightened to approximate edges; tails are trimmed short and organized to avoid entanglement, suggesting reliable square knot construction. Occasional role changes between hands did not compromise knot security.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension is well balanced—deep support appears to bear the load while superficial throws approximate epidermis without over‑tightening; there is no gaping or excessive puckering. The operator maintained modest, consistent tension across the line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Suture spacing is uniform and closely set along the incision, remaining within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm interval and promoting even edge apposition.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is present and deliberate with modest outward ridge at each bite, yielding good epidermal coaptation without excessive eversion or inversion.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is excellent: hands and instruments remain in a tight working envelope with minimal off‑line movement, efficient needle regrasping, and streamlined knot tying and trimming. Workflow is smooth and uninterrupted.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.3/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a reliable, well-controlled vertical mattress closure with consistent needle control, precise tissue handling, and uniform pass placement. Deep and superficial components functioned in concert to produce stable edge approximation without gaping or undue tension, and eversion was modest and consistent across the incision. Knot technique and suture management were methodical and secure, with efficient workflow and minimal wasted motion. Overall this is a proficient execution of vertical mattress suturing suitable for superficial skin closure; minor refinements in absolute spacing uniformity and occasional standardization of needle grip could elevate performance to exemplary.</div>
