<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1018_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Passes appear consistently perpendicular-to-oblique with regular, controlled arcs and appropriate tissue purchase; the labeled vertical mattress dual-pass pattern is executed to provide deep support and superficial epidermal approximation.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is conservative and precise with single, stable forceps grasps, minimal tissue trauma, and careful counter‑traction throughout.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently formed, tightened to maintain apposition, and trimmed close; knot security appears reliable though occasional small adjustments of loops were needed for alignment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension is well balanced—deep support prevents gaping while superficial components provide gentle epidermal approximation without overt strangulation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Sutures are evenly spaced along the incision, with interstitch intervals generally within the 0.5–1.0 cm target and consistent placement.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrates uniform, slight eversion at each stitch site with no visible inversion or edge necrosis on the model.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is good: hands and instruments remain close to the wound, ergonomic hand swaps are efficient, and extraneous movements are minimal.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.9/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a methodical, well-controlled vertical mattress closure. Needle handling, forceps use, and instrument choreography were precise, producing uniform spacing, reliable knots, and consistent slight eversion across the entire incision. Tension distribution between the supportive deep component and the superficial approximation was appropriate, preventing gaping while avoiding excessive epidermal tension. Overall competence is strong with efficient, repeatable technique and sound tissue handling. Minor loop adjustments were occasionally required to equalize alignment, but these were addressed promptly without compromising the repair; the final line is neat, evenly everted, and securely approximated.</div>
