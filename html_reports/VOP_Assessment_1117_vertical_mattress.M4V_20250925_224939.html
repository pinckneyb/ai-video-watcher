<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1117_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Dual-pass vertical mattress technique was executed with controlled, perpendicular needle arcs and consistent dermal-to-epidermal purchase; deep support and superficial epidermal approximation are functionally present and effective. Pass symmetry and needle control are proficient throughout.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is precise and economical—single, firm grasps present and tent the near edge to permit accurate bites with minimal trauma; forceps and needle driver remain coordinated. Occasional minor repositions are appropriate rather than excessive.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently constructed, tightened to maintain edge apposition with modest eversion, and trimmed promptly; knot security appears reliable and appropriate for interrupted closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance is well managed—deep component provides support while superficial throws approximate without excessive epidermal strangulation; occasional localized puckering indicates minor over-tension in places but overall balance is good.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals are largely uniform and within the 0.5–1.0 cm target range, with minor spacing variability early in the sequence that is corrected as the line is completed.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved producing a slight raised ridge along the incision; no inversion is seen and epidermal apposition is generally excellent.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Workflow is efficient and disciplined—hands and instruments remain close to the wound with minimal extraneous movement, a tight cyclic pass/tie/trim sequence, and effective ergonomic adjustments.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.1/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator delivered a methodical, competent vertical mattress closure with good needle control, precise tissue presentation, and consistent knotting technique. Passes are symmetric, perpendicular to the wound, and spaced evenly along the incision; the sequence demonstrates reliable bimanual coordination and minimal tissue handling trauma. Tensioning achieved appropriate deep support with superficial approximation producing consistent eversion and secure apposition. Minor early gaps and occasional localized puckering reflect iterative adjustment rather than technical failure; overall performance meets a high standard of competent, efficient vertical mattress execution.</div>
