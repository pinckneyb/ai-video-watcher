<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1415_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far–far) and superficial (near–near) passes were executed in a consistent, perpendicular fashion with progressive adjustment to bite depth when needed, producing reliable tissue apposition. Overall layer support and epidermal closure were appropriate for vertical mattress technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was gentle and deliberate with single, precise forceps grasps, minimal traction, and controlled presentation of the wound edges throughout. Instrument coordination minimized unnecessary tissue manipulation.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently dressed and maintained secure tension with short, managed tails; individual throws were not always visible but final knot security and placement were reliable. Knot technique appears appropriate and consistent.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension was well balanced between support and epidermal approximation—deep component provided firm support while superficial tightening avoided excessive skin inversion or strangulation. Minor early shallow purchases were corrected in subsequent passes.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing was uniformly consistent along the incision but generally tighter than the ideal 0.5–1.0 cm interval (most bites ~2–5 mm), yielding a dense, even suture line.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was achieved in a controlled, modest fashion across the closure with no inversion or puckering that would compromise edge apposition. Overall eversion quality was good.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motions were economical and methodical with hands remaining in a tight working zone, minimal extraneous movement, and efficient progression from inferior to superior. Occasional hand/instrument switches were ergonomic and did not degrade flow.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrates competent, methodical vertical mattress technique with reliable pass symmetry, controlled needle handling, and excellent tissue stewardship. Deep support and superficial approximation are well balanced; the operator recognized and corrected early shallow bites, resulting in consistent edge apposition and modest eversion without tissue strangulation. Knot security and suture management were orderly and effective, producing a neat column of interrupted closures. The main technical deviation is unusually dense spacing below the ideal 0.5–1.0 cm range, which is uniform but may be excessive for some clinical situations. Overall this is a proficient performance with minor refinements recommended in spacing optimization.</div>
