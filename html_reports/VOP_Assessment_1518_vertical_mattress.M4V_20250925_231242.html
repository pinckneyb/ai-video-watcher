<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1518_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Dual-pass vertical mattress pattern is represented with appropriate layer control and perpendicular needle entry; deep support and superficial epidermal capture appear present and functional.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic with consistent single, precise pickups and minimal unnecessary re-grasps; edges were manipulated gently.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently formed, seated, and trimmed with secure appearance and appropriate bulk for skin closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension is well balanced—deep component appears to provide support while superficial throws close the epidermis without overtightening or blanching.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Sutures are placed at uniform, closely spaced intervals consistent with 0.5–1.0 cm spacing along the entire incision.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrates consistent slight eversion along the line with no evidence of inversion or gaping.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Hands and instruments remain localized with compact, efficient motions and minimal extraneous movement throughout the procedure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.9/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrates competent execution of vertical mattress technique with precise needle handling, atraumatic tissue management, and reliable knot construction. Sutures are evenly spaced and produce consistent slight eversion, indicating appropriate balance between deep support and superficial approximation. Workflow is methodical and efficient: instrument exchanges are economical, hand positions remain close to the wound, and knots are secure and neatly trimmed. Overall this is a proficient performance suitable for clinical skin closure, with room for refinement to reach exemplary (top-tier) effortless fluidity and reproducible textbook perfection.</div>
