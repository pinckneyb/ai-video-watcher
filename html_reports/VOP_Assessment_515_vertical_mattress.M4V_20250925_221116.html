<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) components are executed with consistent perpendicular needle entry and exit, producing reliable layer capture and epidermal approximation. Pass symmetry is generally good with only minor variation in bite angle at a few sites.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is precise — the non-dominant forceps present and evert edges with single, controlled grasps and minimal tissue trauma; occasional brief additional manipulations are efficient and not injurious.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently formed, well seated, and trimmed promptly; throws appear secure and uniform across the line, providing reliable fixation of the closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between the deep support and superficial closure is appropriate overall, giving firm underlying support while avoiding excessive superficial puckering; a few stitches show slightly increased eversion suggesting mildly higher superficial tension at those sites.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing is even and within the 0.5–1.0 cm target throughout the incision, producing uniform distribution of closure forces.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved along the repair, creating a gentle raised ridge without inversion; a minority of bites are more everted than ideal but remain within acceptable limits.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is excellent — hands remain close to the work area with efficient, repetitive pass–pull–knot cycles and minimal extraneous movement.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrated competent vertical mattress execution with consistent pass symmetry, good perpendicular needle control, and reliable layer capture producing uniform epidermal approximation. Tissue handling was precise, forceps use appropriate for eversion and alignment, and knot construction was secure and consistently trimmed, yielding a tidy, well-fixed closure. Overall tension management favored solid deep support with gentle superficial closure; occasional slightly exaggerated eversion at isolated stitches is noted but does not compromise the repair. Motion economy and instrument coordination were excellent, reflecting an efficient, methodical technique appropriate for clinical skin closure. Continuous attention to minor bite-angle variation and superficial tension at a few sites would elevate this performance to the highest standard.</div>
