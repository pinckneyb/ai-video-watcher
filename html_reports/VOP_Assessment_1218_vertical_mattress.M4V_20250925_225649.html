<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1218_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) passes are executed consistently with perpendicular entry and exit, providing expected layered support and epidermal capture. Overall needle trajectories and layered purchase produce appropriate tissue apposition.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic with single precise point contact using fine forceps, minimal slips, and no evidence of crushing or excessive traction. Presentation and eversion of edges are deliberate and efficient.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently formed over the incision with secure throws and proper tensioning; tails are trimmed close without disturbing knots, indicating reliable knot security.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance is well maintained — deep component provides support while superficial throws approximate the epidermis without strangulation or gap formation. Closure shows neither excessive tension nor laxity.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Sutures are placed at uniform, closely spaced intervals approximating the 0.5–1.0 cm target, producing regular coaptation along the incision.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrates consistent mild eversion at each stitch, creating a raised ridge without puckering or inversion across the line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is excellent — hands and instruments remain in a compact working zone with smooth, purposeful movements and minimal extraneous repositioning.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.1/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a competent vertical mattress closure with consistent pass symmetry, predictable needle control, and uniform spacing. Tissue handling was atraumatic and deliberate, with fine forceps used to evert and present edges appropriately; knot construction and trimming were reliable and reproducible. Tensioning between deep support and superficial approximation was well balanced, avoiding epidermal strangulation while maintaining firm wound apposition. Overall the performance demonstrates proficient technical execution and efficient workflow suitable for clinical skin closure. Minor variations in grip position and brief instrument crossings did not compromise coaptation, eversion, or knot security; the closure is stable, evenly everted, and cosmetically acceptable.</div>
