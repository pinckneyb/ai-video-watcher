<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> simple_interrupted_IMG_3186.MOV</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Simple Interrupted</p>
<div class='rubric-point'>1. <strong>Perpendicular needle passes</strong>: Needle was consistently loaded at the proximal third and presented nearly perpendicular; resulting bites on this line appear reasonably symmetric though few full passes were captured. <strong>3/5 proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>2. <strong>Gentle tissue handling</strong>: Dermal edges were lifted with Adsons without obvious crushing; occasional repeated grasps and traction on suture tails produced transient dimpling. <strong>3/5 proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>3. <strong>Square, secure knots</strong>: Knots lie flat and centered with short-to-moderate tails; a couple are slightly tilted, but no clear crossing or air knots are evident. <strong>3/5 proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>4. <strong>Appropriate approximation/tension</strong>: Edges are generally approximated with mild eversion, but there is notable gapping toward the distal end where another stitch is needed, and localized puckering from tensioning. <strong>2/5 competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>5. <strong>Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong>: Spacing is roughly even between central stitches, but the inferior gap to the wound end is larger than acceptable and interrupts uniformity. <strong>2/5 competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>6. <strong>Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable)</strong>: Margin profile is mostly flat to slightly everted with no clear inversion; dimpling around knots is present but not severe. <strong>3/5 proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'>7. <strong>Economy of time and motion</strong>: Multiple setâ€‘ups without committing to a pass/tie and intermittent tidying slowed progress; instrument reloading and repositioning were frequent. <strong>2/5 competent</strong></div>
<br>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.6/5 competent</strong></div>
<br>
<div class='summative-comment'><strong>Summative Comment:</strong> Final count on the right vertical wound in the image: 4 completed simple interrupted sutures. This matches the closing frames of the video. The line shows acceptable approximation centrally with slight eversion but leaves an excessive inferior gap that should have been closed before stopping.</div>
