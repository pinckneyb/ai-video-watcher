<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 217_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Needle passes were consistently perpendicular and placed to provide deep support and superficial epidermal apposition; dual‑pass vertical mattress components are presumed present per case labeling. Overall layer capture appears competent without evidence of tissue bunching or deep gap persistence.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was gentle and controlled with single precise forceps grasps for edge eversion and minimal repeated trauma; instruments remained close to the wound throughout. No excessive traction or broad undermining was observed.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently constructed with staged throws, opposing tension, and secure locking; morphology at completion appears square and stable with appropriate tail management. Occasional brief instrument overlap obscured detail but security was evident.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure was well managed—deep support provided apposition while superficial throws avoided over‑tightening and tissue strangulation. Slight eversion without ischemic puckering reflects good tension distribution.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals were uniform and closely spaced along the entire incision, consistently falling within the 0.5–1.0 cm target range to ensure even edge approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion quality was good and consistent, producing a raised ridge at each stitch with no inversion of epidermal margins; overall approximation promotes optimal epidermal contact.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was efficient and methodical—hands and instruments remained adjacent to the wound with minimal extraneous movement and rapid, repeatable choreography for needle passage and knot tying.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.9/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator executed a reproducible vertical mattress closure with disciplined instrument control and efficient workflow. Pass symmetry and spacing were uniform, tissue handling was gentle and precise, and knot technique produced secure, square-appearing closures with tidy tail management. Eversion was consistently achieved without excessive tension or tissue strangulation. Tension distribution between the deep supportive component and the superficial epidermal closure was well balanced, yielding close apposition and minimal residual gapping. Overall the performance demonstrates proficient vertical mattress technique suitable for reliable skin edge support and epidermal approximation; continued attention to maintaining clear views during knot tying would further optimize assessment of knot morphology.</div>
