<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 918_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components of the vertical mattress technique were executed with consistent perpendicular-to-edge bites and appropriate layer support, producing reliable approximation. Passes were controlled and oriented to capture intended layers.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was atraumatic and precise with small, single dermal grasp points using fine forceps and minimal tissue distortion. Multiple unnecessary re-grasps were not observed.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently constructed with instrument ties and locked throws, demonstrating secure, appropriately tensioned knots and routine tail trimming.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure was well managed—deep support maintained approximation while superficial throws avoided undue epidermal strangulation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Sutures were placed with uniform spacing within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm intervals along the entire incision.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrated consistent modest eversion of the wound edges without inversion or gapping, providing an appropriate ridge for skin healing.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motions were economical with hands and instruments remaining close to the field; workflow followed a steady pass‑tie‑trim cycle with minimal unnecessary movement.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.3/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator executed the vertical mattress closure with precise, controlled needle handling and excellent tissue stewardship. Passes were perpendicular and uniformly spaced, knots were secure, and overall tensioning provided firm deep support while preserving gentle epidermal apposition. Eversion was consistent across the line and there was no evidence of edge inversion or overtightening. Instrument choreography and economy of motion were strong: hands remained near the field, forceps use was delicate, and instrument ties/trim were performed reliably. Overall this is a competent, proficient vertical mattress performance with only minor room for refinement in knot‑work cadence to reach flawless, textbook-level speed and fluidity.</div>
