<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1118_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) passes are executed in a consistently perpendicular/oblique orientation producing symmetric edge capture along the incision; needle control is deliberate and mid‑shaft grasping maintains a reliable arc. Passes are uniform and support appears appropriate for layered vertical mattress closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic with single precise forceps grasps for edge presentation and minimal unnecessary re‑grasping; occasional thumb management of tails is efficient without evident tissue crush.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently constructed, seated close to the wound and trimmed with short tails; knots appear secure and appropriate for skin closure with no evidence of slippage.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between presumed deep support and superficial approximation is well controlled — deep support appears to bear most load while superficial components close the epidermis with gentle eversion and without strangulation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch spacing is uniform and falls within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm interval along the entire incision, producing an even suture line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved across the closure, producing a subtle, even raised ridge without inversion or puckering.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is good with compact hand positioning and minimal instrument travel; a brief local deviation resembling continuous advancement occurred but the operator quickly returned to efficient interrupted technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrates proficient execution of the vertical mattress technique with reliable needle control, symmetric pass placement, and consistent eversion. Instrument handling is atraumatic and coordinated, knots are secure and uniformly seated, and spacing is even producing a neat, well‑approximated epidermal line. Tension distribution appears appropriate with deeper support and gentle superficial closure, avoiding epidermal strangulation while achieving the desired eversion. Workflow is efficient and compact with only a minor, transient deviation from the interrupted sequence that did not compromise overall closure quality.</div>
