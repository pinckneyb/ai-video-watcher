<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 117_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components were executed with controlled, perpendicular needle arcs and consistent dermal purchase, producing reliable layered support and epidermal approximation. Needle handling demonstrated predictable curvature and regrasping when needed to maintain trajectory.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was atraumatic with single precise forceps grasps used to evert and present edges; minimal crush and careful stabilization were evident throughout.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were regularly formed and tightened with appropriate security and tail management; occasional obscured tying sequences prevented absolute confirmation of every throw but overall knot integrity was maintained.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Deep support versus superficial closure was generally well balanced, providing overall apposition, though localized over-tension produced mild puckering and a small residual gap near the superior stitch.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Suture intervals and bite spacing were uniform and consistent along the incision, falling within the expected 0.5â€“1.0 cm range for even approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was achieved consistently along most of the line, creating a slight raised ridge appropriate for epidermal apposition, with only isolated areas showing imperfect contour due to tension.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was efficient: hands and instruments stayed within a compact working envelope with minimal extraneous movements, occasional brief off-axis hand positions did not disrupt workflow.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.9/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The closure demonstrates a methodical, proficient vertical mattress technique with consistent needle control, precise tissue handling, and uniform spacing. Layered pass execution produced dependable edge approximation and maintained intended eversion, while knot tying and tail management were routinely secure. Areas for refinement include more consistent tension modulation to avoid localized puckering and the small residual gap near the superior stitch; deliberate, slightly gentler superficial tightening in that region would improve contour. Overall performance is competent and efficient, suitable for clinical closure with minor attention to tension balance to reach excellence.</div>
