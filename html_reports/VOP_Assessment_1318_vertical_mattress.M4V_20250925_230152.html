<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1318_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Dual-component vertical mattress passes were executed with consistent perpendicular needle approach and appropriate dermal capture, providing expected deep support and superficial approximation along the line. Passes were symmetrical and controlled across the incision.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was atraumatic and precise; the forceps provided single, stable grasps with minimal crushing and consistent edge eversion during bites. Instrument exchanges were smooth and deliberate.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently constructed with multiple throws, tightened securely and trimmed close to the knot; stacks were uniform and resisted loosening during handling. Some knots lacked textbook-tight cosmetic neatness but were functionally secure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance was well controlled — deep support provided backbone while superficial throws approximate the epidermis without excessive strangulation, producing gentle eversion. A small central gap persisted at the end suggesting one area could have benefited from modest additional superficial adjustment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals were regular and within the 0.5–1.0 cm target, producing uniform closure spacing along the entire incision. Occasional minor variability did not compromise approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Overall eversion was consistently achieved with a visible raised ridge and no inversion of edges; tissue apposition appears reliable for healing. Eversion was mild-to-moderate and appropriate for the technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was excellent — hands remained in a compact working zone with efficient instrument choreography, minimal off-field movements, and rapid progression of interrupted stitches. Workflow was deliberate and time-effective.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.3/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed vertical mattress closures with reliable, controlled needle drives, precise tissue handling, and consistent knot security. Passes were placed symmetrically with uniform spacing, the deep component provided firm support while superficial throws approximated the epidermis without undue compression, and overall eversion was appropriate for tension-offloading and edge apposition. Technique was efficient with excellent instrument choreography and minimal wasted motion. Minor deficits include a brief deviation in suture track appearance earlier and a small persistent central gap at completion that could be corrected by slight additional superficial adjustment or an extra throw; these are correctable and do not negate the overall competent, proficient execution.</div>
