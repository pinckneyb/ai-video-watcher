<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) passes are executed in consistent, perpendicular arcs with reliable dermal purchase at the margins, providing expected layered support and epidermal approximation. Pass symmetry is maintained along the line.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is controlled and atraumatic overall, with a single precise grasp used to present and evert the margin though the operator intermittently supplements forceps with fingertip control. There is no unnecessary repeated pinching or rough handling.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently organized and tightened to maintain approximation; exact throw sequence is not fully discrete but security and short, managed tails indicate reliable knot tying. Some knot‑tying detail is not fully visible, limiting highest scoring.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension between deep support and superficial closure is well balanced — deep purchase appears to offload tension while superficial components approximate edges with modest eversion without blanching or puckering. Tension is regular and appropriate along the line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch spacing is uniform and within the desired 0.5–1.0 cm interval throughout, producing a neat, evenly distributed column of sutures. Intervals are consistent and predictable.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved with a slight outward turn of the margins and a uniform raised ridge along the suture line, favoring good epidermal edge apposition. No focal inversion or edge gapping is observed.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is excellent with hands and instruments maintained close to the wound, smooth transfers between driver and forceps, and minimal unnecessary movements or prolonged departures from the field. Brief preparatory actions occur but do not disrupt workflow.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.7/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrates competent to proficient execution of vertical mattress technique across the treated incision. Passes are symmetrical and well oriented, spacing is uniform, and the tactile balance between deeper support and superficial approximation produces consistent mild eversion without focal puckering. Instrument control is steady and bimanual coordination is efficient, supporting precise needle arcs and predictable suture placement. Knot security appears reliable with controlled tail management and consistent tightening, though specific throw detail is not fully observable. Overall the performance reflects a strong, methodical technique suitable for superficial skin closure with good cosmetic alignment; minor refinement in explicit knot‑tying visibility and maintaining exclusive forceps use rather than occasional fingertip substitution would further optimize reproducibility under operative conditions.</div>
