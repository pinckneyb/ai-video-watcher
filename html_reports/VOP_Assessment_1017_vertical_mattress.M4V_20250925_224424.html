<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1017_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components are executed in a consistent, controlled manner with perpendicular-to-oblique needle trajectories producing reliable dermal capture and progressive closure. Overall technique produces appropriate deep support and epidermal approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is gentle and precise with single, atraumatic grasps to evert and present the edges; occasional fingertip stabilization occurs but does not crush tissue.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are constructed with alternating throws, tensioned appropriately and trimmed consistently, producing secure square knots without loose tails.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension between deep support and superficial closure is well balanced—early minor gapping was promptly corrected and final knots maintain dermal support without excessive epidermal strangulation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals are uniform and within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm range, producing an orderly line of interrupted sutures.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrates consistent slight eversion along the repair with no focal inversion, indicating effective vertical mattress effect.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is good: instruments remain close to the wound, hand movements are controlled and rhythmic with only brief micro‑pauses for repositioning.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator executed a methodical vertical mattress closure with controlled needle handling, reliable forceps presentation, and consistent knot technique. Early minor variability in bite depth and transient gapping were corrected as the sequence progressed, resulting in uniformly slight eversion and good dermal approximation at completion. Deep and superficial components functioned together to provide secure support without overt epidermal tension. Overall performance is proficient: instrument control and tissue handling minimized trauma, knots were secure and neatly trimmed, spacing was even, and workflow was efficient. With minor refinement to initial bite uniformity and prevention of early gapping, this technique would approach an excellent standard.</div>
