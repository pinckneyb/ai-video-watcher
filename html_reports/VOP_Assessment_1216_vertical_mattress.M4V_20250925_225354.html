<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1216_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep and superficial components are executed competently with consistent perpendicular-to-oblique needle trajectories and reliable dermal purchase producing secure layer apposition. Passes demonstrate appropriate bite orientation and tissue capture for vertical mattress support.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is atraumatic overall with a single precise grasp per edge and avoidance of crushing; occasional brief counter‑traction to flatten minor puckers was appropriate and controlled.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are formed with a consistent two‑handed technique producing compact, low‑profile throws that remain secure throughout tensioning and trimming.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial approximation is well maintained—deep bites provide support while superficial components approximate without excessive epidermal strangulation, with only occasional minor puckering promptly corrected.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Stitch intervals are uniform and regular along the entire incision, falling within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm range for even distribution of tension.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved with a slight to moderate raised ridge at most bites, preventing inversion and promoting good epidermal edge alignment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is excellent: instruments and hands remain tightly coupled near the wound with minimal extraneous movements, efficient instrument exchanges, and steady progression along the line.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.3/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The repair demonstrates proficient vertical mattress execution with consistent pass symmetry, reliable bite depth, and uniform spacing. Instrument control and forceps use are deliberate and atraumatic, producing predictable eversion and good epidermal coaptation; knots are consistently compact and secure. Workflow is efficient with tight hand positioning and minimal wasted motion. Minor refinements could further optimize outcomes: occasional transient puckering required corrective flattening, indicating brief imbalance during tensioning that should be anticipatorily avoided. Overall performance is competent to proficient—meets operative standards for secure skin edge support and cosmetic approximation.</div>
