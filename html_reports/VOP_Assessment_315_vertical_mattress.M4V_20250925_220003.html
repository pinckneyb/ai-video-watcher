<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 315_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) components are executed consistently along the entire incision with bites taken perpendicular to the wound and predictable needle control. Passes provide scaffolding and epidermal approximation appropriate for vertical mattress technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is deliberate and atraumatic with single precise Adson forceps grasps, minimal crushing, and avoidance of excessive traction or puckering. Transfers and re‑grasping are controlled and limited to what is required for accurate bites.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are instrument‑tied, stacked evenly, and appear secure with short trimmed tails positioned on the surface; throws are consistent and maintain desired tension. Knot construction is reliable and appropriate for dermal closure.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension is well balanced between deep support and superficial approximation — deep components appear to bear closure force while superficial throws produce gentle epidermal apposition without blanching or gaping. Overall tension distribution yields stable approximation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Suture spacing is uniform and consistent, falling within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm intervals and filling gaps between earlier stitches to create an even line. Stitch placement shows deliberate planning and regular spacing.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrates consistent slight eversion along the entire line, producing a raised ridge without inversion; margin apposition is neat and cosmetically appropriate. Eversion is reproducible and maintained after trimming.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is good — hands and instruments remain close to the work zone with compact, efficient passes and brief, purposeful pauses for knotting; occasional instrument rests are minimal and do not interrupt flow. Workflow is methodical and time‑efficient.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator executed the vertical mattress closure with consistent technique: controlled mid‑shaft needle grips, precise two‑instrument choreography, and reliably perpendicular passes producing uniform spacing and effective deep versus superficial support. Knot tying was systematic and secure, tails were managed and trimmed, and the overall line shows modest, appropriate eversion without edge inversion or gap formation. Tissue handling and motion economy were strong — forceps use was precise, instrument transfers were controlled, and hand positioning adapted smoothly to lateral and medial segments. The repair meets a high standard of competent vertical mattress execution suitable for clinical dermal approximation, with only minor inefficiencies in instrument resting that did not affect technical quality.</div>
