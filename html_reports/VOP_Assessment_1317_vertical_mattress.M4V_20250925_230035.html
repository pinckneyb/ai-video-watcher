<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1317_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes were executed with consistent, controlled needle arcs and symmetric entry/exit points perpendicular to the wound margins, providing appropriate deep support and superficial epidermal approximation. Passes demonstrate reliable layering and tissue purchase across the line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was atraumatic and precise; the forceps provided single, targeted grasps for edge eversion and stabilization without undue crushing or repeated grabs. Instrument control minimized excess manipulation of the substrate.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were formed efficiently with short secure throws, seated flat and consistent in size, and tails trimmed to appropriate length, demonstrating reliable knot security. No loose or bulky knots were evident.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension between the deep support and superficial closure was well balanced — deep elements provided firm support while superficial components approximated the epidermis without blanching or strangulation. Overall tensioning preserved perfusion-equivalent appearance and alignment.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Suture spacing was even and methodical along the entire incision, with interstitch intervals consistently within the target 0.5–1.0 cm range. Spacing maintained uniform edge apposition without tissue bunching.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was present and uniform along the repair, creating a slight raised ridge at each stitch consistent with proper dermal apposition and minimizing inversion. There was no evidence of persistent gaping or inversion.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was excellent: hands and instruments remained in a compact working zone with minimal extraneous movement, efficient instrument exchanges, and a steady rhythmic progression along the incision. Workflow was smooth and time‑efficient.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.3/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The repair demonstrates proficient vertical mattress technique with controlled, symmetric passes and reliable tissue purchase. Instrument handling was precise and atraumatic, knots were consistently secure and appropriately trimmed, and the operator maintained efficient, compact hand positioning throughout the procedure. Spacing along the suture line was uniform and maintained good edge alignment. Tensioning between the deep and superficial components was well balanced, producing consistent slight eversion without evidence of over-tightening or tissue strangulation. Overall this performance reflects competent, reproducible execution of vertical mattress closure with good attention to edge eversion, knot security, and operative efficiency.</div>
