<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1115_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) passes were executed in a consistent, perpendicular fashion with predictable needle arcs and reliable tissue purchase at the margins. Passes supported the closure appropriately and produced secure edge apposition.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling was controlled and deliberate with single, precise forceps grasps to evert and stabilize edges; occasional brief instrument assistance was used without undue tissue manipulation. Overall handling minimized trauma.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots were consistently formed, well‑seated and trimmed to short tails with no evidence of slippage; throws appeared square and secure across the closure line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between the deep support and superficial closure was well maintained—deep bites provided support while superficial throws approximated epidermis without overt strangulation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Suture intervals were uniform and fell within the expected 0.5–1.0 cm range, producing even distribution of tension along the wound.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion was present and consistent along the repair, producing a slight, appropriate ridge without inversion or puckering.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion was good with hands and instruments maintained in a compact working zone and minimal departures from the field; brief, infrequent pauses to attend adjacent work were noted but did not degrade flow.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrated a competent, reproducible vertical mattress technique with controlled needle handling, precise edge eversion, and uniform spacing. Needle arcs were predictable and instrument coordination was tight, resulting in consistent dermal purchase and reliable epidermal apposition throughout the suture line. Knots were secure and tails appropriately trimmed. Tension balance between the deep and superficial components was well managed—deep support established without excessive epidermal strangulation—producing a cosmetically acceptable, slightly everted closure. Workflow was efficient with compact hand positioning; minor, brief attentional shifts to adjacent tasks occurred but did not compromise the overall technical quality. Overall performance meets a high standard of competence with only marginal room for refinement in minimizing occasional ancillary movements.</div>
