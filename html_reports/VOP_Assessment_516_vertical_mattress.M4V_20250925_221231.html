<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) pass pattern is executed with consistent perpendicular-to‑oblique needle trajectories and appropriate layer purchase, supporting both deep apposition and epidermal closure. Needle control and entry/exit symmetry are reliable across the repair.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is controlled and precise with a single, purposeful fine‑toothed forceps grasp per bite and minimal unnecessary re‑grasps; bimanual coordination maintained excellent edge presentation.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are constructed with instrument ties, consistently seated and tensioned to approximate edges; throws are secure and tails managed/trimmed appropriately.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Deep support is present and superficial bites close the epidermis, but occasional mild central puckering indicates that superficial throws were slightly tighter than ideal in places, producing minor excess epidermal tension.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing between interrupted vertical mattress stitches is uniform and close, generally within the 0.5–1.0 cm target, maintaining consistent edge apposition along the length of the incision.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is consistently achieved with a visible raised ridge and no inversion of wound edges; overall cosmetic apposition is good though slight localized puckering is present where tension concentrated.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion economy is strong: hands and instruments remain close to the wound with brief, purposeful crossings and minimal extraneous movement, enabling efficient sequential placement.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 2.9/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrates a competent-to-proficient vertical mattress repair with reliable needle control, consistent bimanual technique, and reproducible symmetry in pass trajectory and spacing. Knots are secure and instrument‑tied efficiently, forceps use provides good everting traction, and stitches are placed with steady, compact motions that preserve work‑zone efficiency. Tensioning achieves effective deep support with adequate superficial approximation and consistent eversion, though occasional slight over‑tightening of superficial throws produced minor central puckering. Overall the closure is secure and cosmetically acceptable on the model; focus on slightly softer superficial knot seating in areas of concentrated tension would refine an already solid technique.</div>
