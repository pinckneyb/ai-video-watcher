<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 717_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Dual-pass vertical mattress components appear to be executed with appropriate layer support and generally perpendicular needle entry; deep support is not visibly problematic. No strong evidence of failure of the deep/superficial construct.<br><strong>Score: 2/5 - Novice</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is precise with a single fine forceps grasp per edge, minimal tissue crush, and controlled counter‑traction throughout. Occasional reorientation of the needle did not require repeated forceps manipulations.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are consistently formed and seated, producing secure approximation with focal puckering indicative of adequate knot tension and security. No slipped or loose knots observed during the recorded sequence.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial approximation is generally well managed — measured tightening avoids overcompression though tied points show localized puckering. Deep support appears adequate while epidermal closure remains gentle.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Interrupted sutures are placed in an even, regular series along the superior and mid portions of the incision with spacing consistent within the desired 0.5–1.0 cm range. Inferior segment was not completed during the recording, but placed stitches are uniformly spaced where present.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Eversion is achieved at each tied point with a consistent raised ridge and absence of inversion; slight local puckering is present but overall edge eversion is appropriate for healing.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Economy of motion is excellent — hands and instruments remain compact and close to the wound with efficient choreography, minimal extraneous movements, and good suture management.<br><strong>Score: 4/5 - Proficient</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator demonstrates a proficient vertical mattress technique with controlled needle arcs, precise forceps counter‑traction, and deliberate interrupted placement producing consistent edge eversion and secure knots. Pass symmetry and spacing are uniform along the worked superior-to-midline segment, tensioning is measured with deep support evident and superficial closure avoiding overcompression, and instrument handling is economical and coordinated. Primary deficiency is incomplete coverage of the full incision: the inferior portion remains gaping at the end of the recording, indicating an interrupted workflow or incomplete progression rather than poor stitch quality where placed. Overall competence is strong for the executed segment — technique is reproducible, tissue handling is gentle, knots are secure, and eversion and spacing meet expected standards.</div>
