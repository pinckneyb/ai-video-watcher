<h1>Surgical VOP Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> 1515_vertical_mattress.M4V</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Vertical Mattress</p>
<h2>Rubric Assessment</h2>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>1. Correct deep (far-far) and superficial (near-near) passes</strong><br>Deep (far‑far) and superficial (near‑near) passes are executed in a consistent, reproducible pattern with perpendicular-to-oblique needle entries and controlled arc; deep support appears present and contributes to reliable edge approximation. Overall execution demonstrates competent vertical mattress technique.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>2. Gentle tissue handling</strong><br>Tissue handling is precise and economical: single, stable toothed‑forceps grasps present and evert the edges with minimal repositioning or tissue trauma. The operator maintains a tight pincer configuration that limits unnecessary re‑grasps.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>3. Square, secure knots</strong><br>Knots are formed consistently using instrument ties with appropriate seating and short, managed tails; throws appear secure and uniformly placed along the closure. Knot construction is reliable and reproducible across the line.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>4. Balanced tension deep vs superficial</strong><br>Tension balance between deep support and superficial closure is well controlled: deep component provides firm approximation while superficial throws bring epidermal edges together without obvious ischemia or cutting. Eversion is maintained without overt over‑tightening.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>5. Even spacing (0.5-1.0 cm)</strong><br>Spacing is even and consistent along the incision, with interstitch intervals falling within an appropriate 0.5–1.0 cm range to produce uniform closure. Placement regularity is maintained throughout progression.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>6. Proper eversion</strong><br>Closure demonstrates consistent mild eversion along the entire suture line, producing a raised ridge without inversion or gaping. Eversion quality supports optimal epidermal apposition.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='rubric-point'><strong>7. Economy of time and motion</strong><br>Motion is economical and focused; hands remain close to the work with small wrist-driven movements, minimal off‑field excursions, and efficient transitions between needle passes and tying. Occasional brief hand crossings and a single remote hand movement did not degrade overall efficiency.<br><strong>Score: 3/5 - Competent</strong></div>
<div class='average-score'><strong>Average Score: 3.0/5</strong></div>
<div class='summative'><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong><br>The operator performed a methodical, competent vertical mattress closure with consistent pass symmetry, reliable needle control, and precise forceps-assisted tissue presentation. Passes were perpendicular-to-oblique with regular spacing, instrument ties were uniform and secure, and knots were managed with short tails; the workflow remained steady and focused on the single incision throughout. Tension balance was well maintained — deep support provided robust approximation while superficial components closed the epidermis without overt strangulation, yielding mild, uniform eversion. Overall this is a proficient execution of vertical mattress suturing appropriate for secure, cosmetically acceptable skin approximation; minor inefficiencies (infrequent hand crossings and a brief remote movement) did not compromise technique or wound integrity.</div>
