COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a quiet field: a synthetic skin pad fixed to a wooden board with three vertical wounds—two centrally/right already repaired with simple interrupted sutures, and a left-sided incision still open and unaddressed. After a brief establishing view, the operator begins by preparing the untouched left incision. With the right hand stabilizing the edge using fine tissue forceps and the left hand wielding scissors, a small wedge is trimmed from the inferior corner to freshen the margin and promote clean approximation. As soon as the edge is prepared, the left hand switches to a needle driver while the right hand manages the suture and field.

Setup and loading follow in a measured, methodical rhythm. The curved needle, initially resting on the lower-right pad, is picked up with the needle driver at the proximal-to-mid third of the curve, perpendicular to the jaws and oriented for a perpendicular bite. There are a few passes where instruments hover and rehearse positions over the field without touching tissue—forceps lateral to the wound, driver approaching from the left—refining angle and grip. During this period, the suture tail is kept off the field, swept superiorly to maintain visibility.

Once satisfied with the needle loading, the operator transitions into the first active suturing set-up on the left incision. The right hand’s Adson forceps gently grasps the dermis a few millimeters from the margin to evert and present the near edge; the left hand positions the needle perpendicular to the skin, following the needle’s curvature with wrist rotation. A brief interlude of edge preparation recurs at the distal corner—another precise trim of a small sliver—ensuring crisp, nonragged edges before committing to the pass. The system remains tidy: instruments rarely rest on the pad, and the suture is kept out of the working triangle.

Before fully committing to the left incision, the operator takes a housekeeping pause over the central wound. With the right hand using forceps to elevate a suture and the left hand bringing in a ring-handled cutter, tails are trimmed flush to a knot at the inferior-left corner of the central incision. A quick manual check compresses the area to confirm approximation, then attention shifts back to the open left wound.

Now the suturing proper begins on the left incision. The right hand continues to evert the near edge while the left hand drives the needle perpendicular to the surface, outside-in on the first side. The needle is advanced along its arc, then momentarily released and regrasped to maintain the curve through the tissue. The operator employs a reliable hand-off pattern: the forceps briefly catch the needle tip within the wound lumen, pass control back to the needle driver, and the driver reorients to complete the pass across to the opposite edge. The opposite edge is then taken inside-to-outside, and the suture is drawn through—carefully, with slack managed away from the field. The knot is not tied in these sequences, but the bite symmetry and entry angle are consistent, aiming for even approximation.

This cycle—present, perpendicular entry, follow the arc, regrip, complete the pass, and manage the strand—repeats as the operator advances along the left incision. Work proceeds from inferior toward superior and then focuses on the more delicate apical region. At the corner, the right hand’s pickups purposefully grasp the epidermal-dermal junction to prevent crushing and ensure eversion; the left hand moves in controlled arcs with the driver, often regrasping at the junction of the proximal and middle third of the needle to maintain power and precision. Several frames show partial passes on the near (left) edge with the tip exiting into the wound; the tip is then seized with forceps to facilitate a safe regrip by the driver before the contralateral pass.

As the operator reaches the superior end of the left incision, the first definitive bite is taken on the lateral edge with depth appropriate to the pad (dermal/full thickness of the simulator). The suture is pulled through, leaving a tail. Immediately afterward, the technique varies slightly: a far-to-near approach is set up at the superior end—forceps lift the far edge, the needle is oriented perpendicular, and the far edge is pierced first. This careful change in sequence suggests attention to corner control and bite symmetry at the apex.

There is a brief non-suturing interval where the right hand tensions existing sutures over the central and right wounds, checking puckering and lay of the previously placed stitches. The left hand parks a ringed instrument at the upper-left of the pad, largely out of play, while the right hand assesses stitch tension. No cutting or new passes occur during this interlude.

Preparation resumes with deliberate needle reloading. Both hands bring needle drivers into the field to assist in rotating and seating the needle perfectly in the jaws—an efficient two-instrument method that avoids awkward torque. The suture slack is swept clear. A brief touch with forceps at the right-hand incision confirms tissue control there, but no penetration is performed in this phase.

Returning to the left incision, a complete near-to-far passage is made with the non-dominant hand maintaining consistent eversion on the entry side. The suture is drawn through; then the dominant hand transitions to free-hand traction on the strand to set gentle tension superiorly. Scissors arrive at the edge of the field—poised to trim if needed—while the driver rests laterally.

In the final moments, the active work pauses. The right hand holds the suture strand with the curved needle hanging free and unclamped above the field; no forceps are elevating tissue and no new entry or exit through the pad occurs. The synthetic skin shows the central and right incisions neatly approximated with simple interrupted stitches, and the left incision now displays fresh, symmetric bites and prepared corners, reflecting the careful, staged progression seen throughout.

Across the entire sequence, the technique evolves but remains disciplined: the left hand predominantly runs the needle driver, the right hand manages tissue and assists with hand-offs, eversion is prioritized with light dermal grasps, needle entry stays perpendicular, and regrips occur inside the wound to preserve the needle’s arc. The rhythm alternates between short, precise motor bursts—bite, hand-off, regrip, deliver—and brief pauses for trimming, tension checks, and reloading. Instrument triangulation is constant, suture management is tidy, and the surgeon repeatedly sets the field before each move. The result is a coherent, methodical flow that progresses from wound preparation through measured suturing of the left incision, punctuated by maintenance of previously repaired lines and concluding with the needle free and the field quiet.
