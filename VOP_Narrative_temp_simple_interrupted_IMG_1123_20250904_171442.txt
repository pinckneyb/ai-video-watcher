COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens quietly with instruments parked and the field in view: forceps to the left, a needle driver to the right, and a synthetic skin pad fixed to a wooden board with three vertical cut lines. The right hand is first to move, lifting the needle driver and clearing loose suture from the workspace as the left hand picks up toothed forceps. With both hands now active, the operator tests position over a right‑side incision, the left hand lightly everting a wound edge while the right orients the needle perpendicular to the surface in the plane of its curve. The needle tip touches down and begins to penetrate at the proper offset from the cut edge—an early, careful entry with the curve poised to be followed.

That early probing transitions into a true first pass. Working near the inferior end of an incision, the driver advances the needle outside‑to‑inside on the right edge. As the tip appears in the dermis, the left forceps take the needle near its tip for a controlled hand‑off; the right hand then re‑grasps and retrieves it, drawing the suture through that first lip. At this stage, only a single wound edge is traversed—the opposite side is not yet engaged.

The next phase shows a completed stitch being secured. The curved needle is no longer in play; instead, the driver becomes a tying tool. The right hand forms loops and repeatedly captures the short suture tail while the left hand maintains counter‑tension on the standing end. Throws alternate direction to square the knot, and the operator lays it flat over the incision with measured, symmetric pulls. With the knot built, the driver is set down and the left hand snug‑seats the ends.

Attention shifts to dressing and turnover: the right hand brings in scissors to trim the tails while the left hand stabilizes the knot, then the scissors are set aside and the needle holder returns. The left hand presents a new needle‑suture, and the right hand loads it at the proximal third of the curve, jaws perpendicular to the arc, carefully keeping the point away from tissue until aligned for entry.

With the needle reloaded, the right hand resumes passes on the right wound edge with the left Adson forceps everting the margin at the entry site. The needle lands orthogonally and is advanced by wrist rotation that follows the curve. As the needle emerges partially, the driver re‑grips closer to the tip to complete the pull‑through. Suture is drawn through and organized to leave a controllable loop; only the near lip is traversed in this sequence, setting up for the cross‑wound completion.

A smooth rhythm takes shape: when the stitch is in place, the needle disappears from the driver and the right hand returns to instrument tying over the center of the wound. The left hand switches from forceps to finger control of the limbs, presenting the short end to the driver for each throw. Throws alternate to form flat, squared knots, tensioned in opposite vectors across the incision without blanching. Another trimming interlude follows: the right hand fetches scissors, tails are cut close with the left hand stabilizing the knot, then the needle holder re‑enters to reload for the next pass.

Mid‑sequence, the operator executes full‑thickness passes across an incision with textbook coordination. The right hand, holding the needle at the proximal‑to‑mid curve, enters the near (right) edge at ninety degrees as the left forceps evert the tissue. The needle is driven in an arc through the dermis and emerges on the far side, where the left hand helps present and guide the exit. The suture is pulled through, leaving an appropriate tail, and the needle is reloaded for the return bite or for the next stitch level. On a short transverse cut, a similar pattern appears: extraction, hand‑to‑hand transfer, regrip at the proper spot on the needle body, and a perpendicular re‑entry with tidy suture management off to the side to avoid tangles.

Once a stitch is placed, the left hand often transitions from forceps back to the suture to assist with tying. The right hand, steadfast with the gold‑ring needle driver, converts to a tying instrument. Throws are built by looping the long limb around the jaws, the driver passing through to seize the short tail, then tensioning in alternating directions to square each layer. Occasionally the left forearm crosses the field briefly during tightening before returning lateral, but overall the hands remain opposed across the wound to keep the knot centered. The cadence is consistent: place, tie, cut; reload; repeat.

As the sequence advances superiorly along the wound, the operator’s economy improves. Needle pickups are crisper, entries remain perpendicular, and the pronation‑supination motion follows the curve cleanly. The forceps touch is light, grasping dermis just off the cut edge to evert without crushing. Suture is draped laterally and kept out of the operative zone; instruments at rest are parked superior to the field. After each knot is completed, scissors enter parallel to the wound to trim tails while the left hand stabilizes to prevent loosening.

Several cycles show this choreography: preparation for a new bite with the needle transferred from fingers to the driver; a complete pass from the right edge across to the left with the forceps presenting each margin; then a return to tying—initially with the forceps in the left hand to set the edges, quickly switching to finger control of the strands for instrument throws. The last throws are snugged and cut, and the needle is kept safe on the long limb, parked out of the knot’s way.

By the late scenes, the central vertical incision is now neatly approximated with four simple interrupted sutures, knots trimmed short and lying flat. The two lateral incisions remain open and largely untouched aside from early exploratory handling. The final moments are quiet: instruments rest superior to the pad, both hands mostly out of frame while the board is briefly stabilized, and no active needle driving or knot tying occurs. The overall flow reads as a deliberate, methodical closure—consistent perpendicular passes, gentle edge control for eversion, alternating instrument‑tie throws to square the knots, and tidy tail trimming—punctuated by efficient instrument exchanges and disciplined suture management that keep the field organized from start to finish.
