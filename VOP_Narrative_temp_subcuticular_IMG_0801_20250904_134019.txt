COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens on a suture practice pad with three vertical incisions. The rightmost incision is the sole focus throughout. After a brief view of the untouched field, the right hand enters with Adson forceps to pick up the inferior corner of the right wound edge while the left hand brings in a needle driver. The needle is loaded at the proximal-to-mid third and aimed at roughly 90 degrees to the skin. With the forceps providing gentle eversion 1–3 mm from the margin, the left hand begins the first bite at the inferior end, rotating the needle through the right edge.

As the sequence progresses, the suture from a prior or initiating bite is drawn through, slack is removed, and the needle is reloaded for a controlled arc across the incision. The right hand stabilizes the far/right edge while the driver crosses from the left to align the needle perpendicular to the skin for the opposite side. This early rhythm repeats: expose the edge with pickups, drive the needle in a smooth arc, release and re-grasp to follow the curve, and pull the needle and suture through. The strand is kept lifted and swept superiorly to avoid tangles. After a full pass through both edges at the inferior end, the first knot is tied with the needle parked and the right hand tensioning the free end; the knot is seated neatly at the wound margin. Scissors briefly appear to trim the tail close to the knot, confirming a simple interrupted stitch has been completed.

Working methodically upward along the same incision, the left hand continues to approach from the left side of the field with the needle driver, while the right hand alternates between pickups for tissue control and fingers for suture management. In some passes, the right/near edge is penetrated first (inside-to-outside or near-to-far), then the needle is reloaded and delivered across to the opposite edge. At other moments, the sequence shows far-to-near setup with the needle oriented to enter the opposite side. Throughout, the forceps grasp the dermal margin—not the epidermal surface—to gently evert and present a consistent depth of bite. The needle is consistently clamped on its body near the proximal third, and every entry is kept close to perpendicular for precise, atraumatic passage.

By the mid-portion, the team’s movements are smoother and more economical. The right hand anticipates each entry point, lifting the edge just ahead of the needle tip; the left hand follows the curvature, releases, and re-grasps to bring the swaged end through without levering or tearing the synthetic dermis. Suture loops are managed deliberately: large loops are lifted out of the field, then tensioned in line with the wound to approximate without blanching. Each completed pass transitions into knot tying with the right hand maintaining a steady standing end while the driver guides the throws. Tails are trimmed as they go, leaving a neat row of approximated edges along the inferior-to-mid segments of the incision.

As work moves to the superior third, the same opposing-hand setup persists: needle driver from the left, pickups from the right. The right hand elevates the far/right edge near the superior corner, the left hand aligns the needle at 90 degrees, and a precise rotational entry begins. The instruments cross briefly over the wound during needle handoffs, but collision is avoided by maintaining space and clear lines of sight. Edges come together with slight eversion; bites remain shallow and symmetric to match the earlier stitches.

Near the top of the incision, after another pass is completed and tied, the left hand brings in scissors to trim the fresh knot while the right hand holds tension on the standing limb to keep the knot snug and seated. Immediately after, pickups are used again to present the next edge, and the needle is reloaded for the next bite. At this point, the sequence briefly shifts: rather than taking a new tissue bite, the needle is passed under or around the most recent loop, consistent with forming a locking throw. The wound along the right side already appears well approximated, suggesting a transition to or completion of a running segment at the superior end.

To finalize, both hands coordinate a reloading maneuver using two needle holders to perfect the needle angle, then return to the familiar driver-plus-pickups pattern at the superior corner. The needle is aligned tangentially along the right edge for a dermal/subcuticular trajectory, reinforcing the running finish. With the line secured and the edges uniformly approximated from inferior to superior, the needle is set down to the right of the pad. The left hand brings in scissors one last time to trim the terminal tail, while the right hand briefly steadies the wound edge and then clears the field.

Across the full sequence, the flow is consistent and disciplined: expose, drive, follow-through, manage the strand, tie, trim, and move up the incision. Hand positions evolve from cautious, stepwise passes at the inferior end to fluid, efficient exchanges near the top. Forceps are used only to grasp the dermal margin and evert; the needle is always driven in a controlled arc with re-grips that respect the curvature. Suture control remains deliberate—kept off the field during passage and tensioned in line during approximation—yielding a tidy closure of the rightmost incision, while the central and left incisions remain untouched. The procedure concludes with a cleanly finished line and trimmed ends, the final gestures reflecting confidence and economy of motion.
