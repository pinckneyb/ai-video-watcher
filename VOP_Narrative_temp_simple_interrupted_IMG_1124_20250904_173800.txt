COMPLETE VIDEO NARRATIVE:
============================================================
The video opens with purposeful setup and a clear right–left hand division around a central incision on a synthetic suture pad. The right hand comes in first with a ringed needle driver; the left follows with Adson forceps to present tissue.

Early sequence (0–19 s)
- The right hand loads the curved needle at the mid-to-proximal third, tip perpendicular to the pad, and places the first bite into the right edge of the central wound. The left hand gently everts the margin with forceps to present an even, perpendicular entry. The needle is driven along its arc.
- As that pass is completed, the workflow immediately pivots to knot security. The left hand transitions off the tissue and begins controlling the suture; the right hand keeps the driver and converts it from a needle-driving tool to a tying instrument. Using an instrument tie, the right hand acts as the post, the left hand feeds the long limb around the driver, and the driver captures the short tail. The first throw is delivered and seated down to the wound, drawing the edges together.

Building and seating the first knot (20–49 s)
- With the needle still attached to the long end and parked above the field, the right hand continues to use the driver solely as a tying tool. Loops are formed around the driver; the driver reaches through to pick up the short end, and the hands pull in opposite directions to set each throw.
- Throws alternate direction to square the knot. The tension vectors are diagonal—right hand superior-medial, left hand inferior-lateral—so the knot slides smoothly down the suture line and lies flat.
- The driver is briefly placed off the field, then reintroduced to complete additional throws. By the end of this phase, a single, centered simple interrupted knot sits over the incision, the edges neatly approximated.

Second pass begins; controlled tissue handling (50–69 s)
- Attention shifts to a short central defect. The left hand resumes tissue control with forceps to evert the near edge. The right hand, with the needle loaded mid-curve and perpendicular, advances the tip through the near side and continues across toward the far side, respecting the needle’s natural arc.
- With the bite established, the sequence again becomes knot-focused. The left hand helps control the short tail and stabilizes tissue as needed; the right hand executes instrument throws, entering the loop, grasping the tail, and delivering the throw. Opposing traction from both hands sets the knot snugly onto the wound.

Sustained rhythm of instrument ties (70–89 s)
- The needle is visible but not used to penetrate; it remains parked while the right hand works the driver as a tying tool. The left hand manages the long/standing limb and helps deliver consistent loops.
- Throws are alternated methodically, hands crossing briefly as needed, then separating to tension in opposite directions. When a throw seats, the driver may be set down momentarily as the left hand fine-tunes the lay of the knot, then the driver is picked up again for the next throw. The cadence is steady: loop, grasp, pull, seat—repeat.

Trim and reset for the next stitch (90–99 s)
- With the knot secured, the right hand switches to scissors to trim the suture tails while the left hand steadies the knot. After cutting, the right hand reloads a needle in the driver at the mid-to-proximal third, perpendicular to the pad, and orients above the right wound edge. The left hand brings forceps toward the tissue, preparing to present the next entry point.

Crisp needle passage across the wound (100–109 s)
- The left hand takes a precise bite with forceps, everting the left wound margin of a small central incision. The right hand drives the needle perpendicularly through the near edge, arcs across the defect, and exits at a symmetric point on the far edge. The driver regrips as needed near the tip to pull the suture through while maintaining control. This completes a balanced simple interrupted bite—edges approximated by the pass, not yet tied.

Repositioning above the field; transition to tying (110–129 s)
- The needle is adjusted above the pad; the left hand briefly pinches the needle to help reorient it before the right hand regrips. No additional penetration occurs. Instead, the right hand begins an instrument tie with the needle still on the long limb.
- The left hand now manages the standing limb while the right hand uses the driver to wrap, enter the loop, and capture the short end. Throws are delivered and alternated, then drawn in opposite directions to seat the throw directly over the wound. The knot descends smoothly with each cycle.

Final seating and cut (130–139 s)
- The right hand pulls the last of the suture through and parks the needle out of harm’s way. Bimanual knot management follows: the left hand stabilizes the tissue and maintains gentle counter-tension while the right hand completes the tying sequence to a firm, flat knot centered on the incision.
- With the knot secure, the right hand exchanges the driver for scissors, trims the tails close to the knot, and withdraws, while the left hand steadies the knot to prevent loosening. The field now shows multiple neatly spaced simple interrupted sutures approximating the central incision.

Wrap-up and field check (140–147 s)
- Instruments are set aside. Both hands come off the active field to reposition the pad and briefly touch the suture line, confirming lay and tension. No further needlework occurs; the central line shows three well-seated simple interrupted knots, tails trimmed, with adjacent incisions left untouched.

Overall flow and technique
- The procedure alternates between two distinct modes: precise, perpendicular needle driving with left-hand tissue eversion and right-hand arc control; and deliberate, economical instrument tying in which the right hand’s driver acts as the post and the left hand manages the standing limb. Across the video, the operator consistently parks the needle during tying to keep the field safe and uncluttered, alternates throws to square each knot, and seats each throw by pulling along opposing vectors to lay knots flat without crushing tissue.
- The rhythm is measured: load, present, drive, regrip, pull-through; then loop, grasp, oppose, seat—repeat. Interspersed are brief pauses for instrument exchange, tail trimming, and field repositioning. By the end, the central wound is approximated with multiple simple interrupted sutures, each tied with alternating throws and trimmed, reflecting steady, methodical technique from start to finish.
