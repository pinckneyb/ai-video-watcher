Pattern: Simple Interrupted

Perpendicular needle passes
- The needle is consistently loaded at the mid-to-proximal third and driven perpendicular along its curve, with symmetric entry and exit points and no visible shear. Score 4 because passes are reliably right-angled and balanced; occasional regrips prevent perfectly fluid, single-motion driving.

Gentle tissue handling
- Adsons are used to present each edge with single, light grasps and deliberate eversion, and the needle is parked during tying to keep the field safe. Score 4 for consistently atraumatic handling; eliminate minor unnecessary instrument adjustments to further minimize tissue contact time.

Square, secure knots
- Instrument ties alternate direction with a fixed post and opposing vectors, producing flat, centered knots that seat predictably. Score 4 because knots are clearly squared and secure; tying with the needle still attached—even when parked—introduces small safety risk in confined fields.

Appropriate approximation/tension
- Edges are brought together smoothly without blanching or puckering, and throws are seated to a snug, flat lay without strangulation. Score 4 for consistent, appropriate tension; adding a deliberate micro-check of edge alignment before the final cinch would further standardize outcomes on live tissue.

Even spacing (0.5–1.0 cm)
- The sutures are neatly spaced and centered with balanced, symmetric bites. Score 3 because spacing is acceptable but not demonstrably standardized to a uniform 0.5–1.0 cm cadence across the line; lock in reproducible intervals and constant bite-width-to-spacing ratios.

Edge eversion (flat/slight acceptable)
- Prepass eversion with forceps and perpendicular driving yields flat to slightly everted edges without inversion. Score 4 for reliable eversion; consider a marginally larger far-side bite or an intentional “lift on exit” to ensure durable eversion under physiologic tension.

Economy of time and motion
- The workflow is steady with a consistent tying cadence, but repeated driver set-downs, intermittent hand crossing, and pad repositioning add avoidable micro-inefficiencies. Score 3 for competent efficiency that will improve by retaining the driver in hand, minimizing regrips, and sequencing steps to avoid field departures.

Summative assessment:

Summative assessment
Your core mechanics are solid: perpendicular passes that respect the curve, deliberate eversion, and properly alternated instrument ties that seat flat. To sharpen this from good to excellent, standardize spacing by planning the line before the first stitch (match bite-width to inter-suture distance, keep bites equidistant from the edge, and maintain a reproducible 0.5–1.0 cm cadence). Eliminate needless motions: keep the driver in your dominant hand throughout, minimize regrips by completing each pass in one smooth arc, and avoid setting instruments down between throws. During tying, either pass off or clamp the needle securely out of the working zone and maintain a strict post to prevent knot creep; seat the first throw only after confirming edge apposition and eversion, then finish with throw counts appropriate to suture type. These refinements will increase speed, safety, and consistency without sacrificing tissue respect.
